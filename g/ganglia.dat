5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired <b>ganglia.</b> In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural <b>ganglia</b> are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral <b>ganglia</b> control the sensory organs, while the pleural <b>ganglia</b> supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal <b>ganglia,</b> which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral <b>ganglia,</b> which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These <b>ganglia</b> are both connected to the cerebropleural <b>ganglia</b> by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal <b>ganglia</b> to control them.|$|E
5|$|The sensory <b>ganglia</b> are {{directly}} correspondent to dorsal root <b>ganglia</b> of spinal nerves and {{are known as}} cranial sensory <b>ganglia.</b> Sensory <b>ganglia</b> exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic <b>ganglia,</b> which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a notable}} but {{variable}} trend towards fusion of other <b>ganglia</b> into the brain. The brains of horseshoe crabs {{include all the}} <b>ganglia</b> of the prosoma plus those {{of the first two}} opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of <b>ganglia.</b> In most living arachnids, except scorpions if they are true arachnids, all the <b>ganglia,</b> including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no <b>ganglia</b> in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the <b>ganglia</b> of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused, and in scorpions the <b>ganglia</b> of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-related {{activity}} in the basal <b>ganglia</b> can be directly measured with PET and SPECT scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related {{activity in}} the basal <b>ganglia</b> can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced basal <b>ganglia</b> dopamine-related activity is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|The basal <b>ganglia</b> are a {{group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the forebrain. The primary function of the basal <b>ganglia</b> appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The basic {{arthropod}} {{central nervous}} system consists {{of a pair of}} nerve cords running below the gut, with paired <b>ganglia</b> as local control centers in all segments; a brain formed by fusion of the <b>ganglia</b> for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth, so that the esophagus is encircled by this conglomeration of <b>ganglia.</b> Except for the primitive Mesothelae, of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family, spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids: all the <b>ganglia</b> of all segments behind the esophagus are fused, so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no <b>ganglia</b> in the abdomen; in the Mesothelae, the <b>ganglia</b> of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired <b>ganglia,</b> the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding <b>ganglia</b> {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The <b>ganglia</b> above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (gullet). The pedal <b>ganglia,</b> which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural <b>ganglia</b> surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of <b>ganglia,</b> or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of <b>ganglia</b> are fused into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of <b>ganglia</b> under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal ganglion.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal <b>ganglia</b> which can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal <b>ganglia</b> are fused to form a composite structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of <b>ganglia</b> due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six <b>ganglia</b> in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body <b>ganglia</b> fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the <b>ganglia</b> just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral <b>ganglia</b> instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{learning}} {{is the ability}} for rewards and punishments to modify behavior. It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of <b>ganglia</b> close to the antennae, there are <b>ganglia</b> in each segment and a collection of major <b>ganglia</b> below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal <b>ganglia,</b> a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal <b>ganglia</b> are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal <b>ganglia</b> exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal <b>ganglia</b> receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Pathology in the basal <b>ganglia</b> may be {{indicated}} by rigidity {{and resistance to}} movement of the limbs, and {{by the presence of}} characteristic involuntary movements.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{cranial nerves}} have sensory or {{parasympathetic}} <b>ganglia</b> (collections of cell bodies) of neurons, which are located {{outside of the}} brain (but can be inside or outside of the skull).|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal <b>ganglia</b> ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal <b>ganglia</b> that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal <b>ganglia</b> can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
5|$|The neuroacanthocytosis syndromes {{are caused}} by a range of genetic {{mutations}} and produce a variety of clinical features but primarily produce neurodegeneration of the brain, specifically the basal <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} <b>ganglia,</b> and six abdominal <b>ganglia.</b> Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III {{in close proximity to}} the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
5|$|The trigeminal <b>ganglia</b> of the {{trigeminal nerve}} (V) {{occupies}} {{a space in}} the dura mater called Trigeminal cave. This ganglion contains the cell bodies of the sensory fibers of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal <b>ganglia,</b> and not in dorsal root <b>ganglia,</b> thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal <b>ganglia,</b> and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In all platyhelminths, {{the nervous}} system is {{concentrated}} at the head end. This is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather like those of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. Other platyhelminths have rings of <b>ganglia</b> {{in the head and}} main nerve trunks running along their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal <b>ganglia,</b> and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic <b>ganglia,</b> however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, <b>ganglia</b> or plexa), they can cause pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue {{contains}} no pain sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their <b>ganglia</b> are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal <b>ganglia</b> structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two <b>ganglia,</b> one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve <b>ganglia</b> in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal <b>ganglia,</b> play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal <b>ganglia</b> control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal <b>ganglia</b> by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral <b>ganglia,</b> but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
5|$|The basal <b>ganglia,</b> {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal <b>ganglia</b> (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal <b>ganglia.</b> Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
