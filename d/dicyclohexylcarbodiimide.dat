50|$|A common way to {{synthesize}} an NHS-activated acid is to mix NHS with the desired carboxylic acid {{and a small}} amount of an organic base in an anhydrous solvent. A coupling reagent such as <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> (DCC) or ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) is then added to form a highly reactive activated acid intermediate. NHS reacts to form a less labile activated acid. The group itself is usually written as SuO- or -OSu in chemical notation.Such an ester with an acid and NHS, sometimes called succinate ester, is stable enough to be purified and stored at low temperatures in the absence of water and, as such, is commercially available. NHS esters are commonly used for protein modification (e.g. an NHS ester of fluorescein is commercially available, and can be added to a protein to obtain a fluorescently labeled protein in one simple reaction and purification step).|$|E
5000|$|These {{activating}} {{agents were}} first developed. Most common are <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> (DCC) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Reaction with a carboxylic acid yields a highly reactive O-acylisourea.During artificial protein synthesis (such as Fmoc solid-state synthesizers), the C-terminus {{is often used}} as the attachment site on which the amino acid monomers are added. To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group, the negatively charged oxygen must first be [...] "activated" [...] into a better leaving group. DCC is used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group (which is now an ester group), making nucleophilic attack by an amino group (on the attaching amino acid) to the former C-terminus (carbonyl group) more efficient.The problem with carbodiimides {{is that they are}} too reactive and that they can therefore cause racemization of the amino acid.|$|E
50|$|Fischer {{esterification}} or Fischer-Speier esterification is {{a special}} type of esterification by refluxing a carboxylic acid and an alcohol {{in the presence of}} an acid catalyst. The reaction was first described by Emil Fischer and Arthur Speier in 1895. Most carboxylic acids are suitable for the reaction, but the alcohol should generally be a primary or secondary alkyl. Tertiary alcohols are prone to elimination. Contrary to common misconception found in organic chemistry textbooks, phenols can also be esterified to give good to near quantitative yield of products. Commonly used catalysts for a Fischer esterification include sulfuric acid, tosylic acid, and Lewis acids such as scandium(III) triflate. For more valuable or sensitive substrates (for example, biomaterials), <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> is often used. The reaction is often carried out without a solvent (particularly when a large reagent excess of alcohol is used) or in a non-polar solvent (e.g. toluene) to facilitate the Dean-Stark method. Typical reaction times vary from 1-10 hours at temperatures of 60-110 °C.|$|E
50|$|Heterocumulenes are {{molecules}} {{consisting of}} a linear chain of carbon atoms {{with one or more}} of another atom attached to the end. The carbon atoms are all joined by double bonds C=C=C=C. Similar molecules termed cumulenic, have a chain of alternating triple and single bonds. C≡C-C≡C-.... Heterocumulenes are commonly found in space or flames. Most of the longer ones are very unstable and reactive, and thus have a transient existence, or can only survive when dilute or in an inert matrix. Molecular clouds in space are very dilute and allow heterocumulenes to exist long enough to be detected. Some simple heterocumulenes are common chemicals or ions. These include carbon dioxide, carbon disulfide, carbon diselenide, cyanate, thiocyanate. Some definitions of heterocumulenes include compounds that contain concatenated double bonds with more than one element, but may have other parts to them. This class includes ketene, sulfur diimide, and <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.</b> Some heterocumulenes can act as ligands with various metals.|$|E

In the proteolipid subunit {{which was the}} most heavily labeled polypeptide labeling was confmed to five residues at the NH 2 -terminus and five residues at the C-terminus ofthe protein. Labeling occurred at similar positions compared with the homologaus protein (subunit c) in the ATP synthase from Escherichia coli, indicating a similar structure of the proteolipid subunits in their respective organisms. The inhibitors oligomycin and <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> did not change the pattern of accessible surface residues in the proteolipid, suggesting that neither inhibitor induces gross conformational changes. However, {{in the presence of}} oligomycin, the extent oflabeling in some residues was reduced. Apparently, these residues provide part of the binding site for the inhibitor. After reaction with <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> an additional labeled amino acid was found at position 65 corresponding to the invariant carbodümide-binding glutamic acid.

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of the proteolipid subunit of the A TP synthase was analyzed in six mutant strains from Escherichia coli K 12, selected for their increased resistance towards the inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. All six inhibitor-resistant mutants {{were found to be}} altered at the same position of the proteolipid, namely at the isoleucine at residue 28. Two substitutions could be identified. In type I this residue was substituted by a valine resulting in a moderate decrease in sensitivity to <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.</b> Type II contained a threonine residue at this position. Here a strong resistance was observed. These two amino acid substitutions did not influence functional properties of the ATPase complex. ATPase as well as A TP-dependent proton-translocating activities of mutant membranes were indistinguishable from the wild type. At elevated concentrations, <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> still bound specifically to the aspartic acid at residue 61 of the mutant proteolipid as in the wild type, and thereby inhibited the activity of the ATPase complex. It is suggested that the residue 28 substituted in the resistant mutants interacts with <b>dicyclohexylcarbodiimide</b> during the reactions leading to the covalent attachment of the inhibitor to the aspartic acid at residue 61. This could indicate that these two residues are in close vicinity and would thus provide a first hint on the functional conformation of the proteolipid.
