40|$|A compact imaging detector, {{based on}} {{scintillation}} fiber optics, {{has been used}} for high resolution industrial radiography since 1996. This type of imaging detectors have proven to give superior performance compared to fine grained <b>industrial</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>film</b> in terms of detection efficiency and spatial resolution. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show that the radiographic sensitivity can be improved even further. First, the detection process has been studied by Monte-Carlo simulations and the result shows that the radiation is detected in a very narrow range from the axis of the primary beam. Secondary, Monte-Carlo simulations shows that a bent fiber optic image conduit can eliminate radiation induced noise in the CCD almost completely and reduce the depth of the detector to less then 100 mm...|$|E

By standard methods it is difficult to detect less than a marked change in skeletal mass, and the fine structure of bone is not readily apparent on the usual films. Recently Meema and Schatz (1) have obtained better visualization of the fine detail of bone by adapting the techniques of mam-mography to the hand film. The fine-grained <b>industrial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> provides superior resolution, making it possi-ble to see the fine structure of bone in much greater de-tail with an 8 X magnifying lens.

40|$|Generalized {{projections}} {{have recently}} {{been used by the}} writer to determine the distortion of some aromatic hydrocarbons. The study by Grenville-Wells (1955) of the variation of the fill factor (for Cu Ka radiation) of Ilford G <b>Industrial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> with the angle of incidence has been most useful in the intensity estimation of non-equatorial layer-line reflexions. The considerable difference between observed and calculated film factors, found by Grenville-Wells, appears to be larger than the likely experimental error. This discrepancy may possibly be due to neglecting the absorption of energy by the photo-chemical effect (Cox & Shaw, 1930). It is difficult to estimate the loss of intensity from an X-ray beam due to this cause. Let us therefore assume as a very rough first approximation that this loss is proportional to the incident intensity I 0. Hence the intensity of the X-rays, after passing through a film, is I [...] I 0 (1 [...] C) exp [-/~t sec v], where C is the constant of proportionality determined {{by the nature of the}} photographic emulsion, /~t is the sum of the setJarate products of the linear absorption coefficients with the thicknesses of black paper, emulsion and film base, and v is the angle the incident X-rays make with the normal to the film. Therefore the film factor is given by A good straight line was obtained on plotting in R" against sec v, when the experimental results of Grenville-Wells were used. From this graph the constants C and ~t were determined. It was thus found that the variation of R with v could best be represented by R = 1. 29 exp [0. 942 sec v]. The values of R calculated according to this equatio...|$|E

Strips were air dried, under restraining conditions to prevent warping, in a thermostatically controlled chamber (air temperature, 20  ±  2 °C; and relative humidity, 65 %) for a week. Negative X-ray images of strips were recorded {{with a soft}} X-ray apparatus (Softex Co., Tokyo, Japan) on <b>industrial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> (Fuji Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The conditions for soft X-ray measurements were as follows: voltage 20  kVp; electric current 14  mA; lighting distance 2.2  m; and duration of irradiation for photography, 4  min. Films were washed several times and dried at room temperature in air.

40|$|In mammograqphy, {{it is most}} {{important}} to consistently produce high-contrast, high-resolution images at the lowest radiation dose consistent with high image quality. In recent years, {{there have been many}} significant technological improvements in mammographic x-ray equipment, image recording systems, and viewing conditions. Some of the major technical development milestones in mammographic imaging are shown in Table 1. Until the mid 1980 ’s, many x-ray units were used that were not dedicated to mammography. These x-ray units had tungsten target tubes that were designed originally for medical imaging procedures, such as chest radiography. Some of these units had compression devices that were home made; therefore, breast compression was less than optimal by today’s standards. Many of these units had very large focal spots or short focal spot-to-breast surface distances that could result in significant geometric blur (unsharpness). Direct exposure (<b>industrial</b> type) <b>x-ray</b> <b>films</b> were being used, which often required long exposure times (causing blur by motion) and which resulted in high radiation exposure. In addition, viewing conditions were inadequate. Today, mammography is performed with dedicated mammographic x-ray equipment. These units have specially designed tube targets, smaller focal spots, and significantly improved breast compression devices, among other features. Cassettes and screen-film combinations are designed specifically for mammography. Film processing and viewing conditions also have improved significantly over the years. In 2000, the first digital mammography system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use...|$|R

40|$|Background: Using {{the fastest}} dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> {{available}} {{is an easy}} way of reducing exposure to ionizing radiation. However, the diagnostic ability of fast films {{for the detection of}} proximal surface caries must be demonstrated before these films will become universally accepted. Methods: Extracted premolar and molar teeth were arranged to simulate a bitewing examination and radiographed using Ultraspeed and Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>films.</b> Three different exposure times were used for each film type. Six general dentists were used to determine the presence and depth of the decay in the proximal surfaces of the teeth radiographed. The actual extent of the decay in the teeth was determined by sectioning the teeth and examining them under a microscope. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two films for the mean correct diagnosis. However, there was a significant difference between the means for the three exposure times used for Ultraspeed film. The practitioners used were not consistent in their ability to make a correct diagnosis, or for the film for which they got the highest correct diagnosis. Conclusions: Ektaspeed Plus dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> is just as reliable as Ultraspeed dental <b>X-ray</b> <b>film</b> for the detection of proximal surface decay. The effect of underexposure was significant for Ultraspeed, but not for Ektaspeed Plus.

Using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films,</b> sex could be assigned using demarking points to 47 % and 50 % females in Lagos State. In conclusion, this research has provided evidence that the ischiopubic index and the demarking points are reliable in sexing the hip bones of Nigerians (using <b>X-ray</b> <b>films).</b> Thus the ischiopubic index may be of value in forensic and archaeological analyses and in solving medicolegal cases...|$|R
