A nine-year member of the Katanning Road Board and an unsuccessful candidate at the 1933 election, Watts opened his campaign on Monday, 19 August, at the Katanning Town Hall. He supported the lowering of tariffs, statutory opposition to rises in interest rates, and {{the extension of the}} co-operative system, as well as prompt implementation of the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on bulk handling. Watts opposed nationalising banking, and was critical of the state government's attempts to reduce unemployment and the federal government's implementation of the <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act, both of which he considered unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|During his reign, the UFA {{government}} repealed prohibition, {{replacing it}} with government sale of liquor and heavily regulated privately run bar-rooms, passed a <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act to help indebted farmers, and aided workers with progressive wage codes. It abolished the provincial police, passing law enforcement outside of the municipalities to the RCMP. The government bailed out the bankrupt Alberta Wheat Pool in 1929. The high point of Brownlee's administration came after long negotiations {{with the federal government}} concerning Alberta's natural resources. In 1930, control of these resources was turned over to the province. Hurrying to hold an election before the full effect of the Depression kicked in, Brownlee led the UFA to a third majority government in the 1930 election. As he moved to the fiscal right, he alienated socialists and labour groups.|$|E

500|$|In {{defending}} his conservatism, Brownlee emphasized that [...] "history {{has yet to}} record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery" [...] and mused that [...] "if the results were not so tragical, I {{would like to see}} Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our people could have the actual experience of what would happen and learn for themselves the lesson that in our present day world situation, one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position {{of the rest of the}} world".

500|$|At Brownlee's instigation, the Greenfield {{government}} had implemented a <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act, which allowed farmers in Alberta's drought-stricken southeast to access credit counselling services {{and provided a}} way to settle creditors' claims without ruining farmers or resorting to litigation. [...] At the time, Brownlee had wanted to extend it province-wide, but had been dissuaded by the opposition of moneylenders. [...] In 1928, as premier, Brownlee tried again. [...] Lending institutions again objected, and threatened {{to withdraw from the}} province if the act was extended. [...] Brownlee felt that these threats were disingenuous, noting that similar measures already existed to protect merchants. [...] However, it was a prosperous time for farmers, and so mobilized support for the legislation was in shorter supply than it might have been during a time of economic hardship; Brownlee, newly disillusioned with bankers, withdrew the bill.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} did not give up on addressing the problem when it ended subsidies. [...] It had previously commissioned {{a number of studies}} on the agricultural situation and related factors, and converted some of the results of these studies into legislation. [...] The <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act of 1923 was designed to adjust farmers' debts to a level that they could actually pay, thus allowing them to carry on while still ensuring that creditors received as much as was feasible. [...] In the words of University of Calgary professor David C. Jones, the bill offered [...] "solace, but no real satisfaction". According to Jones, Greenfield's attempts to rescue southern Alberta from agricultural calamity were probably doomed to failure. [...] Even so, Greenfield had called the situation his top priority, and his failure to bring it to a successful resolution cost him politically.|$|E

500|$|In autumn 1928, {{an early}} frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent. [...] Farmers began {{to demand the}} {{extension}} of the <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act over the entire province, along with more radical measures. [...] Citing the example of R. W. Barritt, a farmer near Mirror who had lost his farm at the end of 1928 to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation despite diligent efforts to pay off his debt, they demanded legislation that would spread the burden of failed crops between debtor and creditor, rather than leaving it all on farmers. [...] Brownlee rejected such calls: [...] "Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment, whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time, there comes a limit {{to the extent to which}} the Government is justified in interfering".|$|E
500|$|The UFA {{took office}} {{at a time}} of drought in the {{southern}} regions of the province. At Brownlee's instigation, the government appointed a three-person panel, led by Charles Alexander Magrath, to investigate the problem. [...] In 1922 the government passed the Drought Relief Act. [...] The Act, a Brownlee brainchild, created a Drought Relief Commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration. [...] It authorized the adjustment of farmers' debts to levels that were within the debtors' means, but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make loans would not disappear altogether. [...] Brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers' assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees. [...] In 1923 this was replaced by the <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act, which strengthened the commissioner's powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province; due to opposition from lenders, the portions of the act dealing with other than drought-stricken areas were never proclaimed.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} part of Brownlee's premiership, the {{presidency}} of the UFA was still held by his old friend and ally Henry Wise Wood.

[...] Even so, Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee's term, he started to replace Wood as the [...] "centre" [...] of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not. [...] Despite this, his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy. [...] The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the <b>Debt</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Act in the face of opposition from banks. [...] He also rejected the notion, dear to many UFA members, that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership. [...] He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy, and that the government of Alberta ought to be accountable not only to UFA members but to the population at large.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the financial structure of small firms by emphasizing {{the role played by}} financial distress. We specify a model of <b>debt</b> <b>adjustments</b> that allows us to investigate the specific nature of the adjustment process towards target debt levels in small firms, which is then extended to account for the effect of financial distress on financial structure decisions. Our models were estimated by the Generalized Method of Moments on a data panel of small Portuguese firms during a period of recession, in which a substantial proportion of the companies analyzed faced a financial distress situation. We find that small firms do adjust their debt ratios towards target levels, the speed of adjustment being faster in the shorter term. Our results also indicate that there are major differences in the determinants of long-term and short-term debt, highlighting the role played by debt maturity in explaining a firm’s finan-cial structure. Finally, random behavior is observed in finan-cially distressed firms, who seem to be disoriented when making their financial structure decisions.

40|$|As is {{the case}} in most of the {{countries}} of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, the system of intergovernmental finance in Hungary has undergone radical change since the early 1990 s. The move from a centralized, government-controlled economy toward one that is more decentralized and driven by market forces poses particular challenges for maintaining hard budget constraints. The roles and responsibilities of different levels of government are in flux and new institutions are evolving. All of this occurs in the context of important political changes. The case of Hungary demonstrates that, despite the intensity of such a transition, steps can be made to strengthen and maintain a hard budget constraint among different levels of government. Not all measures and aspects of the system contribute to hard budget constraints (indeed, some do just the opposite), but on balance the Hungarian system has developed some noteworthy mechanisms for assuring that most of the liabilities of the local levels of government are not passed up to the center. Perhaps of greatest importance in this area is the legislation established in 1996 on municipal <b>debt</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Three key channels that influence hard budget constraints are considere...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{agent-based}} {{model in which}} heterogeneous and boundedly rational agents interact by trading a risky asset at an endogenously set price. Agents are endowed with balance sheets comprising the risky asset as well as cash on the asset side and equity capital as well as debt on the liabilities side. A number of findings emerge when simulating the model: {{we find that the}} empirically observable log-normal distribution of bank balance sheet size naturally emerges and that higher levels of leverage lead to a greater inequality among agents. Furthermore, greater leverage increases the frequency of bankruptcies and systemic events. Credit frictions, which we define as the stickiness of <b>debt</b> <b>adjustments,</b> are able to explain a key difference in the relation between leverage and assets observed for different bank types. Lowering credit frictions leads to an increasingly procyclical behavior of leverage, which is typical for investment banks. Nevertheless, the impact of credit frictions on the fragility of the model financial system is complex. Lower frictions do increase the stability of the system most of the time, while systemic events become more probable. In particular, we observe an increasing frequency of severe liquidity crises that can lead to the collapse of the entire model financial system...|$|R
