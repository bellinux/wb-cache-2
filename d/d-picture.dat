40|$|The article {{deals with}} basic optical {{concepts}} {{and how to}} use them to obtain three dimensional information of a pictured scene. Some fundamental concepts in optics are delivered and the modelling of lenses, the main optical component of a camera, is presented. In a further step the mathematical background of camera modelling is sketched. Last but not least, the discussion will address how to extract 3 d-information from a 2 <b>d-picture.</b> In this regard the stereo camera system with its mechanism of triangulation becomes important...|$|E
40|$|In Kaszanitzky and Schulze (2017) we gave {{necessary}} {{conditions for}} a symmetric <b>d-picture</b> (i. e., a symmetric realization of an incidence structure in Rd) to be minimally flat, that is, to be non-liftable to a polyhedral scene without having redundant constraints. These conditions imply very simply stated restrictions {{on the number of}} those structural components of the picture that are fixed by the elements of its symmetry group. In this paper we show that these conditions on the fixed structural components, together with the standard non-symmetric counts, are also sufficient for a plane picture which is generic with three-fold rotational symmetry C 3 to be minimally flat. This combinatorial characterization of minimally flat C 3 -generic pictures is obtained via a new inductive construction scheme for symmetric sparse hypergraphs. We also give a sufficient condition for sharpness of pictures with C 3 symmetry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this project}} the {{applications}} of terrestrial laserscanner for recording characteristics {{of quality of}} standing trees are examined. Furthermore it is investigated to what extent inhomogeneous bark structures, for example, branch scar, blind conk etc. can be recognized and so indicate the inner wood quality of a tree. The effects of the outward wood defects are explained by means of stems which were finished to sliced veneer. The interesting parameters are, for example, the expected block-, or rather, the loglength, the ovality in different heights, {{the volume of the}} log as well brachiness, numbers and shape of the branch scars. This method of measurement hopes to contribute to the sustainability in value and enable approximate through-cut calculations of standing trees. This problem was exemplarily investigated by analyzing seven logs of the tree species European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus spec.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium). To detect the outward wood defects on the scanned trees the laserscans were unwound and analyzed. Firstly the trees were identified in the laserscanner data, and for every trunk, the diameters were calculated of the log ends. These diameters were averaged and yielded the diameter of the reference cylinder, which constitutes an ideal trunk. The scan coordinates were converted into picture coordinates by means of different transformation matrices. The result of this cylindrical unwinding is a 2 <b>D-picture</b> for every scanned tree. These pictures were applied to another analysis software, which enabled an semiautomatic wood defect detection and classification. The software works with different image algorithms as well as with a neural network, so that the recognition rate of the software can be improved by reading of training data records, and furthermore, learn from each additional picture analysis. The result of the analysis was the corresponding classification of ever...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} {{contribute}} to the branch of research that is engaged in the analysis of different stimulus presentation formats and their influence on quality and validity of the test results in a Conjoint Analysis. This topic has gained special attention as new techniques became available that enable the inclusion of holographic three-dimensional stimuli in the research of consumers’ preferences. Especially for examining design-related questions this proves very interesting. The study compares the results of two Choice Based Conjoint analyses with one presenting the test object via computer-based 2 <b>D-pictures</b> and the other using a holographic 3 D-simulation. For the attributes at hand no differences between the results of the 2 D- and 3 D-test can be isolated on an aggregate level.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of many structures and building forms such as space frames, dome subdivisions and geodesic patterns {{are derived from}} any of the known polyhedra, hence the main title of this book 'Polyhedroids', or polyhedron related forms. A proper understanding of their geometry is crucial, as this determines in many aspects the overall form of buildings, the dimensions of structural parts and the directions under which they meet. In this book the basic {{geometry of}} polyhedra is treated and also their application in structures with examples from the own practice of the author, sometimes of relatively great span or height. The book is illustrated with many coloured pictures and a whole chapter is filled with anaglyphs, 3 <b>D-pictures</b> for the vision of which special spectacles with red and blue glass is needed.

Methods for two dimensional measuring were developed for co-cordinates and lits for - grates - moved grates -sequential projected lines - moved lines, each with solving the problem correspondence. Examination to - registration of line structures in 2 <b>D-pictures</b> (Design Lines) - connection of gray code and line projection - use of the phase shift method, were realised and converted to methods and algorithms. The effect of real optical and lighting systems and in the signal communication channel were analysed and versions were developed for the handling. Gauging methods and software are available for 2 D-shooting systems from the micro area (500 x 500 #mu#m" 2) to the macro area (2 x 3 m" 2). Micro systems in the 2 D-field and 3 D-measuring set were realised as an alternative measuring system to photo measuring systems.

40|$|Shift meteorologists are {{supposed}} to understand the weather situation and {{have to make a}} forecast that is consistent with the actual situation. To get grip on the weather situation in most of the weather rooms the forecaster starts an analysis of the weather by looking at surface observations. Drawing surface charts is the second activity and hereby isobars, (Norwegian) fronts and troughs are the most important features. Filling in weather symbols will be the finishing touch of the surface chart. To get a more 3 <b>D-picture</b> of the weather radiosondes are looked at and every 6 hours higher level isolines are analysed. Since the middle of 2000 the approach at the KNMI is different and from this time satellite images are the starting point for forecasters to analyse the weather situation. The meteorologists try to recognise the cloud patterns in these images by using the knowledge of conceptual models. Cloud tops and cloud patterns seen by satellites, are the fingerprints of physical processes in the troposphere. Conceptual models describe the physical processes trough clouds phenomena, physical parameters, life cycles and weather events. The thinking of a forecaster in terms of conceptual models is a way to get a 3 D- or even 4 D-mental weather picture. (See in this respect: “Manual of Synoptic satellite Meteorology Conceptual Models ” supported by EUMETSAT). A Regional Satrep (abbreviation of Satellite report) is a satellite image overlayed with the names of the conceptual models. The trajectories for the very short-range forecast period, up to 18 hours, determine the area of interest (region). As guidance the overlayed images and the describing text are given or send to (remote) forecasters. Discrepancies between NWP model output and Regional Satrep can also be a trigger for the highest alert and a starting point for model modification...|$|E
40|$|The human {{thinking}} {{is based on}} three successive fundamental steps: perception, abstraction and interpretation. One {{of the most interesting}} subjects in the field of human perception and the scientific world is definitively the spatial sense, which is illustrated by many papers, from the ancient world till this day in all different sciences. In nature two different principles are known: ultrasonic distance measurement and stereo vision. The first measures the time of a travelling signal, starting from the emitting animal to the reflecting objects in his environment back to animal 2 ̆ 7 s receiver. The second uses the triangulation effect between two spatial different sensors, which allows an estimation of the distance to the environmental objects. After a general introduction (Chapter 2 - 3) the first main part of this Dissertation is engaged in the comprehensive theme of the technical realisation of depth perception (Chapter 4). The second main part (Chapter 5) works on another interesting field in research and technology: the optical spread spectrum communication. Both topics seem to have little relation, but they are merged in their multidimensional approach and their underlying principle of correlation reception. A more detailed overview is given in the following: After the introduction to the both subjects in Chapter 1, the fundamental terms of space and time are discussed at the beginning of Chapter 2, comparing the opinions and interpretations of the most important scientists in history. Afterwards some elementary principles of modern signal and system theory are illustrated to provide the understanding of the presented work. Chapter 3 gives a survey of the components which are utilisable in optical time of flight measurement systems. Particular attention is drawn to the novel photonic mixer device, which fuses the receiving and processing of optical signals into a smart device. Therein a mixing of the optical signal and a reference takes place during the electro-optical generation of electrons. Based on this unique feature the principle of a correlation reception is declared. Chapter 4 gives detailed facts of the presented distance measurement system, which is known as optical time of flight measurement. Therein a lot of technical problems in electro-optical correlation reception are discussed in detail, starting from lasers {{as one of the most}} effective light sources over the novel unique optical receiver named PMD to the optimisation of distance calculation algorithms. Based on the one-dimensional TOF-distancemeasurement a new 3 D-camera is presented and discussed in comparison to approaches using the similarities in several conventional 2 <b>D-pictures.</b> Finally a second application similar to the distance measurement is presented shortly: the fluorescent lifetime measurement. After that the suggested spread-spectrum communication is explained in Chapter 5. This multiple access system bases on the use of chirp signals, which allows an effective management of the resource bandwith. A discussion of all chirp parameters in the time and frequency domain demonstrates their efficiency. After that an experimental setup, also using the novel optical receiver PMD, is presented with first results. At least a summery of the main points of this work and future aspects of the PMD technology in 3 D-camera systems and optical communication is given in Chapter 6...|$|R
40|$|Strukturelle Veränderungen der ossären Mikroarchitektur stellen beim Krankheitsbild der Osteoporose einen grundlegenden Abschnitt der Pathogenese dar. Die hohe Auflösung der Mikro-Computertomographie sowie das nicht-destruktive Ermitteln dreidimensionaler Volumendatensätze machen eine Visualisierung und Quantifizierung der Veränderungen möglich. Im Falle eines simultanen Vorliegens der (Risiko-) Faktoren postmenopausaler Hormonlage und Steroidtherapie zeigt sich jedoch ein noch recht unerforschtes Gebiet, das dringend weitere Aufklärung mithilfe von Tiermodellen sucht. Mittels µCT kann die Bestimmung spezifischer Parameter beim quantitativen Vergleich der Struktur des osteoporotischen Knochens zu gleichaltrigen gesunden Ratten erfolgen. Über eine Studienlaufzeit von insgesamt vierzehn Monaten wurden Spongiosaproben aus dem Wirbelkörper Th 10 sowie der proximalen Tibia von ovarektomierten Ratten unter Steroidtherapie mit Sham-Tieren sowie einer Kontroll-Gruppe verglichen. Messungen der Strukturparameter und die mikro-computertomographische Darstellungen des dreidimensionalen Trabekelwerkes erfolgten einen, drei, zwölf und vierzehn Monat/e postoperativ. Um eine Analyse der Strukturparameter BV/TV, Tb. N, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, SMI, Tb. Pf und i. S durchführen zu können, wurden die Daten bei einer isotropen Voxelgröße von ca. 7 µm (Th 10) bzw. 8 µm (Tibia) detailgetreu rekonstruiert. Die Bestimmung der Spongiosalänge erfolgte anhand axialer Tomogramme. Der zeitliche Verlauf der Osteoporose-Gruppe (OVX + Steroide) zeigte (hoch) signifikante Reduktionen des relativen Knochenvolumens BV/TV, der trabekulären Schnittfläche i. S sowie der Trabekelanzahl Tb. N in beiden Regionen. Dementsprechend vergrößerte sich die intertrabekuläre Distanz Tb. Sp hoch signifikant und ein drastischer Rückgang der trabekulären Ausdehnung in der Tibia war zu sehen. Deutliche Wechsel in der Oberflächenmorphologie von Konkavität zu Konvexität mit konsekutiver Abnahme der Vernetzung sowie Änderungen von platten- zu stab-ähnlichen Strukturen konnten durch (hoch) signifikante Wertanstiege in Tb. Pf bzw. SMI nachgewiesen werden. Bereits Einzelergebnisse, jedoch v. a. die Kombination der deutlichen Resultate bewiesen die Induktion osteoporotischer Verhältnisse im Tiermodell der ovarektomierten Ratte unter Steroidtherapie. Allerdings lässt die Entwicklung der Trabekeldicke Tb. Th mit einem gleichbleibenden Wert der Wirbelkörper bzw. einer Zunahme in den Tibiae noch einige Fragen offen und demonstriert die Wichtigkeit weiterer vergleichender Studien in diesem Gebiet. Structural {{changes in}} the micro-architecture of bone display a basic segment of the {{pathogenesis}} of osteoporosis. Visualization and quantification of these changes are achieved by a high resolution of micro-computertomography and a non-destructive gathering of a three-dimensional volumetric dataset. In case of a simultaneous combination of postmenopausal hormone-deficiency and steroid therapy only a few studies can be found that show {{the effects of these}} (risk) factors. Therefore, further investigation by using animal models has to be done. In order to compare the structure of an osteoporotic bone with healthy rats quantitatively a micro-CT calculation of specific parameters is helpful. Vertebral and tibial samples of ovariectomized rats with steroid therapy were compared to sham groups as well as to one control group. Measurements took place after one, three, twelve and fourteen month/s of the duration of this study. The length of spongiosa was defined by the last trabeculae in the axial slices and showed a marked decline over fourteen months. The analysis of the morphometric parameters BV/TV, Tb. N, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, SMI, Tb. Pf and i. S was done after the reconstruction of 3 <b>D-pictures</b> by using an isotropic voxel size of approximately 7 (Th 10) or 8 (tibia) micrometer. In both regions the time course of the osteoporosis group (OVX +Steroide) showed (highly) significant reductions in the percent bone volume BV/TV, the intersection surface i. S and the trabecular number Tb. N. Inversely, the trabecular separation Tb. Sp extended highly significant. Drastic shifts in surface morphology like a changing from concavity to convexity and thus a following decrease in trabecular connectivity could be detected with a highly significant growth in the trabecular pattern factor Tb. Pf. Also, the SMI increased significantly and demonstrated a conversion from plate- to strut-like objects. All of these results, but especially their combination, established the induction of osteoporosis in animal models of ovariectomized rats with steroid therapy. However, the development of the trabecular thickness Tb. Th shows stable values in vertebral bodies and even an obvious rise in tibial trabecular bones. These findings highlight that many questions have not been solved yet and demonstrate the importance of further studies dealing with this kind of risk factor combination...|$|R
