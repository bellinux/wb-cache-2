50|$|The pivotal {{issue in}} pushing the bid forward was obtaining state funding and an {{unlimited}} state financial guarantee, {{as required by}} the Olympic Charter. 19 June 2013, the Norwegian Olympic Committee and Oslo had put forward their application for <b>funding</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> to the Ministry of Culture (Norway). Eventually the cabinet would have to present the issue to the Norwegian parliament, Storting, as the constitution gives the parliament power of the budget. The application for state funding was put through a legally required quality assurance review. DNV GL conducted the assessment. On December 20, 2013 they presented their conclusion in which they concluded that the bid was without significant weaknesses, and that the public net costs would probably end on 21,7 billion NOK, and with 85% certainty below 25,8 billion NOK. The next step following the review of DNV GL was to have the Ministry of Culture forward the application to the parliament. Before this was executed, the bid had been withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of public {{policies}} in various countries of South America on the development of microfinance (MF). A broad definition of public policy has been used in this work, as it covers specific legislation seeking to develop more inclusive financial systems; government participation in official bank programs; second-tier bank funds; the use of targeted <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> intelligent subsidy schemes, etc. Particular attention is focused on financial system regulatory frameworks, as they tend to play a fundamental role in the success of such programs. An analysis is made of best practices recommended by international agencies, matching them against the existing framework for microfinance activities in the countries analyzed. The main conclusion that can be drawn is that despite the very varied nature of the initiatives pursued, one common element observed in all the countries surveyed is the role played by commercial banks in MF development. Nevertheless, note should be taken of the direct and indirect role played by the state in encouraging the involvement of the financial sector as the leading provider of MF, a role that is in general based on criteria of selfsustainability and commercial practices. ...|$|R

40|$|Private sector {{pension plans}} have {{undergone}} substantial change {{in form and}} structure in the United States {{over the last two}} decades. This paper explores and evaluates these changes using information on pension plan characteristics gathered by the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL) since 1980 in their periodic Employee Benefits Survey (EBS) of medium and large establishments. We also discuss how future data collection efforts could be improved to better measure key changes in the form and design of employer-sponsored pensions. Key findings are as follows: Many aspects of defined benefit plans changed over time. For example, vesting rules were loosened; plans eased access to normal retirement; and pension benefit formulas moved toward final rather than career earnings, with increased weight on straight-time pay. In addition, these plans became more integrated with social security; at the same time, the form of social security integration changed substantially. The evidence also indi 6 ate that defined benefit plan replacement rates fell over time and benefit caps limit years of service counted in the retirement formula. In addition, disability benefit provisions grew more stringent; and participants were increasingly permitted to take a lump sum from their defined benefit plan. Defined contribution plans also have evolved over time. Here, plan participants were granted greater access to diversified stock <b>and</b> bond <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fewer were permitted to invest in own-employer stock, common stock <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> insurance contracts. Participation and vesting rules appear most lenient for workers in 401 (k) plans; generally employees must contribute a fraction of their pay to their plans rather than relying only on employer contributions; and employee access to pension fund assets fund assets prior to retirement is growing. ...|$|R

In addition, a study at Saïd Business School showed that the Olympics had a 100 percent consistency of cost overruns in the period 1960-2012, with the average cost overrun in real terms at 179%. In the period 1999-2012, the average cost overrun is lower, in real terms at 47%.|$|R

Assuming that the pension fund’s retribution is equal to a fixed part of the surplus (that is the difference between the final value of the portfolio managed by the pension <b>fund</b> <b>and</b> the <b>guarantee),</b> we show in this paper that the optimal benefit consists always in a non-random <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> a certain fixed part of the surplus.

40|$|The {{pension system}} {{existing}} in Ukraine does {{not correspond to}} the modern requirements of society and needs radical reforms in which the main focus {{should be on the}} introduction of a mandatory accumulative pension system. It is shown that accumulation of funds in accumulative pension system (APS) requires complex calculations. A model for accumulation of funds in the accumulative pension insurance system used in this paper makes it possible to determine a set of interrelated parameters – insurance premium rates, reasonable insurance periods, the desired rates of profitability, the required amount of savings, investment potential of accumulative pension system, etc. The amount of funds in accumulative pension insurance system depends not only on the basis of insurance (number of payers of insurance premiums), the amount of contributions (rate and object) and (primarily) on the term of beginning of payments of insurance premiums, the coefficient of profitability of invested <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantees</b> of their safety at all stages of functioning of the accumulative system. The analysis has shown that it is necessary: to cover all people employed in the economy with accumulative pension insurance; a rate of contributions should be determined not only by wages, but also by income; prior to the introduction of accumulative pension system – to create the necessary infrastructure, to develop a legal framework, to organize the management of accumulative funds, to solve the issues related to the protection of funds from the risks of losses.

While Otto was working at his {{fellowship}} in England, Francis tried to use his connections at Washington University to get his brother a faculty position. Unfortunately, it was to no avail; however, Francis was able to convince faculty members at the nearby University of Minnesota to consider Otto for their new biophysics program. Otto received an official invitation to the University of Minnesota in February 1939 with a dual appointment to the departments of Zoology and Physics. Otto and his wife narrowly missed the outbreak of World War II with their departure from England in August of the same year. Otto turned out to be less than satisfied with his new position, which was heavily focused on instruction rather than research. After revealing his dissatisfaction with his older brother, Francis would again play an important role in his younger brother’s advancement - this would be the final time that Francis would intervene for his younger brother. At the time, Francis was being offered a new position at MIT. As a stipulation, Francis wanted his brother Otto to be offered a tenure-track position as well. MIT obliged, and Otto was offered such a position. When word reached the University of Minnesota, they were quick to give Otto incentives to stay, including “…tenure as an associate professor (skipping the rank of assistant professor), a 28% pay raise, tripled research <b>funding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> support for two graduate students.” Harkness Otto decided to remain at the University of Minnesota.|$|R

40|$|This study {{illustrates}} and interprets {{changes in}} pension plan retirement formulas and benefit provisions {{over the last}} two decades, using extensive information on private sector pension plans gathered by the U. S. Department of Labor since 1980. Data generated from the Employee Benefits Survey (EBS) of medium and large firms shows that pension provisions have changed a great deal in companies that have traditionally been the most consistent providers of employer-sponsored retirement benefits in the US. In the defined benefit environment, vesting rules were loosened somewhat; plans have eased access to normal retirement; and pension benefit formulas have moved toward final rather than career earnings, with increased weight on straight-time pay. In addition, these plans became more integrated with social security, but the form of this integration has changed substantially. Defined benefit pension replacement rates appear to have fallen over time, though the time series is not complete. In addition, benefit caps remain in place, generally by limiting years of service in the formula; disability benefit provisions have also become more stringent; and it is increasingly possible to take a lump sum from one's defined benefit pension. The defined contribution environment has also seen substantial change, as documented in the BLS series. Participation and vesting rules appear most lenient for workers in 401 (k) plans; most employees must contribute to their plans, generally as a function of earnings; and employee access to pension fund assets appears to be on the upswing over time. Participants in these plans have also gained access to diversified stock <b>and</b> bond <b>funds,</b> with fewer permitted to invest in own-employer stock, common stock <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> insurance contracts.

In order to test performance persistence we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Cross-product ratio and Chi-squared test and results have been classified into 4 different categories. The results suggest the presence of diseconomies of scale in the mutual fund industry. Moreover, mutual funds are under no efficient information allowing companies to adopt opportunistic behaviours by charging higher fees that do not match with their obtained results. Finally we also conclude that when fees are charged over results, there is a greater alignment of objectives between managers and participants.
