5000|$|A phytoplasma {{effector}} protein, SAP54, {{has been}} shown to induce virescence and phyllody when expressed in plants. SAP54 homologs have been identified in various phytoplasma species. Two SAP54 homologs, PHYL1 of the onion yellows phytoplasma and PHYL1PnWB of the peanut witches’ broom phytoplasma, induce phyllody-like floral abnormalities. These results suggest that PHYL1, SAP54, and their homologs form a phyllody-inducing gene family, the members of which are termed phyllogens. MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs) of the ABCE model play critical roles in floral organ development in Arabidopsis. Phyllogens interact directly with class A and class E MTFs, inducing protein degradation in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner. [...] The accumulation of mRNAs <b>encoding</b> <b>class</b> B MTFs, the transcription of which is positively regulated by class A and class E MTFs, is drastically decreased in Arabidopsis constitutively expressing PHYL1. Phyllogens induce abnormal floral organ development by inhibiting the functions of these MTFs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cell wall}} of C. cupreum is largely {{composed}} of chitin and glucan, which {{is reflected in}} the large number of acquired genes <b>encoding</b> <b>class</b> V chitin synthase and glucan synthase found in the C. cupreum cDNA. The vegetative mycelium is profusely branched, septate and multicellular; the mycelial cells are multinucleate. The species is distinguished from other Chaetomium species by a high frequency of boat-shaped ascospores and copper coloured terminal hairs. The fruiting bodies occur {{on the surface of the}} substratum and are attached by undifferentiated rhizoids. The perithecia of C. cupreum are ovate in shape and copper colored with dimensions of 110-120 x 120-130 μm. The presence of long, thin hairs on the outer surface of the perithecium is a characteristic feature of Chaetomium (Gr. χαίτη = long hair). In C. cupreum, these hairs are numerous, thin, septate lateral hairs with a base 3.0-3.5 μm in diameter. Hairs at the apex of the perithecium are rigid, septate, 4.5-6.0 μm in diameter with 1-2 spirals. The apical hairs are covered with small copper coloured granules whose pigment is soluble in alcohol, ether, cellosolve, xylol but insoluble in water. Club-shaped asci measuring 38 × 13 μm develop in clusters n the interior, basal part of the perithecium. Each ascus contains 8 reddish ascospores that are boat shaped with dimensions of 10.0 × 5.5μm. The walls of the asci are mucilaginous and disintegrate, causing the ascospores to remain inside the perithecium at maturity, embedded in mucilaginous jelly. The ascospores and the mucilaginous matrix form a paste that is extruded through the apical opening in the the perithecium producing [...] "cirrhi" [...] resembling toothpaste squeezed out from a toothpaste tube. Chaetomium cupreum is intermediate between the species: C. trilaterale Chivers and C. aureum Chivers. C. aureum and C. cupreum both produce conspicuous cirrhi while C. trilaterale does not. The ascospores of C. cupreum are similar shape but larger than C. aureum. The pigment produced by C. trilaterale in agar cultures is water soluble while the granules produced on C. cupreum are insoluble.|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in developmental biology is how cells exchange positional information for proper patterning during organ development. In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved {{with a central}} vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor {{in one direction and}} microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT, produced in the vascular cylinder, moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR 165 a and MIR 166 b. Endodermally produced microRNA 165 / 6 then acts to degrade its target mRNAs <b>encoding</b> <b>class</b> III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors in the endodermis and stele periphery.

Inactivation of 11 myosin genes resulted in no discernible phenotypes under the normal growth conditions. In contrast, the knockouts of the remaining two myosin genes, XI- 2 (formerly MYA 2) and XI-K, exhibited similar defects in root hair elongation suggesting that the myosin-driven motility {{plays a significant role}} in a polar tip growth. Strikingly, inactivation of each of these myosins also reduced trafficking of Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria in root hairs and in leaf epidermal cells.
