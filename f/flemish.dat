5|$|As part {{of their}} , the Germans began {{repatriating}} <b>Flemish</b> prisoners of war in August 1940. By February 1941, 105,833 <b>Flemish</b> soldiers had been repatriated. Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers were still in captivity by 1945. Many prisoners of war were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture and around 2,000 died in captivity.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s, <b>Flemish</b> {{literature}} {{began to}} reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West <b>Flemish,</b> the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s {{until his death in}} 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks ("Of Today and Tomorrow") was launched to bring <b>Flemish</b> literature to an audience outside Belgium. <b>Flemish</b> literature continued to flourish in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels.|$|E
5|$|In 1337 <b>Flemish</b> weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} woollen cloth. More <b>Flemish</b> weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>Flemish</b> {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's <b>Flemish</b> parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of <b>Flemish</b> fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar <b>Flemish</b> clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being <b>Flemish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{originated}} from the loose <b>Flemish</b> Movement, which historically has included {{an array of}} organisations seeking, to varying degrees, to promote Flanders. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, <b>Flemish</b> nationalists operated within the established political parties, and had close ties with the political left. The early organised political expression of <b>Flemish</b> nationalism was triggered by World War I, and the introduction of universal suffrage and proportional representation in elections. The main party that initially represented the movement was the left-wing nationalist Front Party, founded by former soldiers and sympathizers from the trench wars in Flanders Fields disaffected with their French-speaking, often anti-Flemish, officers that had been unable to communicate with their troops. From the 1930s, the main party became the <b>Flemish</b> National Union which turned to collaborate with the Nazis during World War II, as they had promised them increased <b>Flemish</b> autonomy. These circumstances would compromise the re-emergence of <b>Flemish</b> nationalism after the war, although only a faction of the broader movement had actually pursued an agenda of collaboration.|$|E
5|$|The opera is set {{during the}} nineteenth century in the fictional <b>Flemish</b> town of Quiquendone.|$|E
5|$|Vinkensport traces {{its origins}} to {{competitions}} held by <b>Flemish</b> merchants in 1596, {{and is considered}} part of traditional <b>Flemish</b> culture. As of 2007, {{it was estimated that}} there are over 13,000 enthusiasts, called vinkeniers ("finchers"), breeding 10,000 birds every year. Animal rights activists have opposed the sport for much of its history.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} <b>Flemish</b> {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular <b>Flemish</b> party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the <b>Flemish</b> electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E
5|$|All {{the high}} reliefs of the portals {{of the cathedral}} were {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} <b>Flemish</b> painter Peter Paul Rubens.|$|E
5|$|As the {{independent}} state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution, {{the issue of}} a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question. At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with <b>Flemish</b> dialects in decline, increasing numbers of <b>Flemish</b> people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in <b>Flemish</b> literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, the <b>Flemish</b> Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|During the 1340s Sir John Radclyffe campaigned with Edward III in France, {{distinguishing}} {{himself at}} the battles of Caen, Crècy and Calais. As a reward for his service, the king allowed Sir John to take some <b>Flemish</b> weavers back to his Ordsall estate, where he built cottages for them to live in. English weaving skills at that time were poor, and textiles from Manchester {{were considered to be}} of particularly poor quality, so the <b>Flemish</b> weavers were employed in instructing the local weavers. They also started up a silk weaving industry, the foundation for Manchester's later cotton industry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Frederick II, Kronborg Castle was {{designed}} by two <b>Flemish</b> architects, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen who started the work in 1574 and Anthonis van Obbergen who finished it in 1585. Modelled on a three-winged French castle, it was finally completed as a full four-winged building. The castle burnt down in 1629 but, under orders from Christian IV, was quickly rebuilt {{under the leadership of}} Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger, son of the famous <b>Flemish</b> artist. It is widely recognized as one of Europe's most outstanding Renaissance castles and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the <b>Flemish</b> nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the <b>Flemish</b> ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

5|$|Other {{multi-ethnic}} {{parts of}} Europe frequently found war memorials equally contentious. In Flanders, the IJzertoren, a controversial <b>Flemish</b> memorial tower, was opened in 1930, commemorating the sacrifices during the war, but also celebrating <b>Flemish</b> identity and marking the hard treatment of <b>Flemish</b> activists by the Belgian authorities during the conflict. In disputed multi-ethnic territories in the east, such as Transylvania, {{the war had}} created bitter memories between Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants. The arguments were played out in differences {{as to how the}} dates of the war-in which Hungary and Romania had entered and left at different times-were recorded on tombstones and other memorials. In Serbia, the Kosovo Maiden was extensively used in war memorials, drawing a link between the war and the Battle of Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Suske en Wiske {{meanwhile}} was {{a steady}} success, {{and although the}} sales have dropped from the peaks of the 1970s continues {{to be one of}} the most popular <b>Flemish</b> comics.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} administration repressed {{political dissent}} and launched numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour on military projects. It also supported the radical <b>Flemish</b> Movement by making numerous concessions {{as part of}} the Flamenpolitik in an attempt to gain support among the country's <b>Flemish</b> population. As a result, numerous resistance movements were founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers. Low-level expressions of dissent were common although frequently repressed.|$|E

5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{continued}} to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% {{of the vote in}} the 2000 local elections. In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In the 2004 <b>Flemish</b> Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the cordon sanitaire. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular <b>Flemish</b> party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the <b>Flemish</b> electorate.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Vlaams Blok seized {{the occasion of the}} ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name Vlaams Belang was established. (Other proposed names included the <b>Flemish</b> People's Party and <b>Flemish</b> Freedom Front.) The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leadership {{made it clear that the}} party would fundamentally remain the same.|$|E
5|$|The main {{ideological and}} {{political}} {{strategies of the}} Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the <b>Flemish</b> autonomy issue, later {{to be followed by}} focus on immigration and security, exploitation of corruption and other scandals, and defense of traditional values. While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of <b>Flemish</b> interests, its voters were mainly motivated by anti-immigration and anti-establishment protest.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the <b>Flemish</b> Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the <b>Flemish</b> Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
5|$|Although Italian Renaissance had {{a modest}} impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was {{influential}} in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through {{the influence of}} wealthy Italian and <b>Flemish</b> merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by <b>Flemish</b> pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both <b>Flemish</b> and Walloon communities {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a <b>Flemish</b> separatist agenda, though this message was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{changes in}} post-war {{politics}} impacted considerably on the memorials. in Belgium, the <b>Flemish</b> IJzertoren tower had become associated with Fascism during the Second World War and was blown up in 1946 by anti-Flemish activists, leading to outrage. Proposals were put forward {{to build a}} national monument on the site, but ultimately a second <b>Flemish</b> memorial was constructed instead. In Romania, the Communist post-war government moved away from commemorations around Ascension Day, which was seen as carrying too many religious meanings. The Romanian Societata itself was abolished in 1948, pilgrimages to the memorials ceased and {{the focus of the}} Communist government was almost entirely placed on commemorating the sacrifices of the Soviet army during World War II. Unusually, political changes in Canada led to the construction of new World War I memorials; some of the inter-war tensions eased, and 35 new memorials were added in Quebec to the existing 68 in the post-war years, often built as combined memorials to later conflicts.|$|E
5|$|In 1502 Henry VII {{sent his}} <b>Flemish</b> {{portrait}} painter Maynard Wewyck {{to the court}} of James IV and Margaret Tudor. Later in the sixteenth-century anonymous artists made portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon (1566), and George, 7th Lord Seton (c. 1575). The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by minorities and regencies between 1513 and 1579. James VI employed two <b>Flemish</b> artists, Arnold Bronckorst (floruit, in Scotland, 1580–1583) and Adrian Vanson (fl. 1581–1602), who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who {{became one of the most}} successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I and trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94).|$|E
5|$|In 1585 the <b>Flemish</b> {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth"). Decimal fractions had been employed for {{the extraction of}} square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using decimals was so important that the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage {{was only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the Germans {{introduced}} the Flamenpolitik, intended to divide German-occupied Belgium by favouring Dutch speakers over French ones. In February 1941, repatriation of <b>Flemish</b> prisoners began. At the time, Dutch dialects were still widely spoken in French Flanders and, although Belgian prisoners were primarily {{targeted by the}} policy, some French prisoners were also released as a result.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the <b>Flemish</b> Movement had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the <b>Flemish</b> Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise <b>Flemish</b> demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the <b>Flemish</b> nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{resistance}} was focused in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia {{and the city of}} Brussels), although <b>Flemish</b> involvement in {{the resistance}} was also significant. Around 70 percent of underground newspapers were in French, while 60 percent of political prisoners were Walloon.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} {{election}} results in elections other than those for the <b>Flemish</b> Parliament (and the Dutch-speaking electoral college in the European Parliament) gives a somewhat wrong image of the party's support, given that the party only ran in Flanders, the one half of Belgium.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 1945, {{three days}} after the start of Suske en Wiske op het eiland Amoras, {{appeared}} the first page of De Familie Snoek (The Family Snoek), a weekly series of gags revolving around a contemporary <b>Flemish</b> family. It lasted for 11 albums.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 June, the crowd {{continued}} west along the Thames, burning the houses of officials around Westminster and opening the Westminster gaol. They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming Newgate Prison. The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the <b>Flemish,</b> 35 of the community were killed. Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the <b>Flemish</b> weavers.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance {{architecture}} thrived {{during the}} reigns of Frederick II and especially Christian IV. Inspired by the French castles of the times, <b>Flemish</b> architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. In Copenhagen, Rosenborg Castle (1606–24) and Børsen or the former stock exchange (1640) {{are perhaps the}} city's most remarkable Renaissance buildings.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% {{heavier than the}} late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} relations between the original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the <b>Flemish</b> trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was exactly 64:63 in the 14th century.|$|E
