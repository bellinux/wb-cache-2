5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{was active}} in the area between 1891 and 1894. Although he lived in nearby South Norwood he visited the Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood area {{regularly}} in connection with the Upper Norwood Literary and Scientific Society. The Foresters Hall on Westow Street was then known as the Welcome Hall (or just Welcome) and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> hall in May 1892 that Arthur Conan Doyle was elected president of the society. He was re-elected to the post in 1893 and resigned in 1894. Each occasion was in the same hall.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|In 746, {{he moved}} to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his {{official}} career. He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children—three sons and two daughters—but one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he began to have lung problems (probably asthma), {{the first of a series}} of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.|$|E

2500|$|As {{much as the}} Orthodox Church reveres and {{depends on}} the scriptures, they cannot compare to the Word of God's {{manifest}} action.

5|$|Most Lithuanian Jews {{perished in}} the first phase during the first months of the {{occupation}} and before the end of 1941. The first recorded action of the Einsatzgruppen (Einsatzgruppe A) took place on June 22, 1941, in the border town of Gargzdai (called Gorzdt in Yiddish and Garsden in German), {{which was one of the}} oldest Jewish settlements in the country and only 18 kilometres (11mi) from German-annexed Memel. Approximately 800 Jews were shot that day in what is known as the Garsden Massacre. Approximately 100 non-Jewish Lithuanians were also executed, many for trying to aid their Jewish neighbors. About80,000 Jews were killed by October and about175,000 by the end of the year. The majority of Jews in Lithuania were not required to live in ghettos nor sent to the Nazi concentration camps which at that time were just in the preliminary stages of operation. Instead they were shot in pits near their places of residence with the most infamous mass murders taking place in the Ninth Fort near Kaunas and the Ponary Forest near Vilnius. By 1942 about 45,000Jews survived, largely those who had been sent to ghettos and camps. In the second phase, the Holocaust slowed, as Germans decided to use the Jews as forced labor to fuel the German war economy. In the third phase, the destruction of Jews was again given a high priority; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> phase that the remaining ghettos and camps were liquidated.|$|E

25|$|Watteau {{was born}} in October 1684 {{in the town of}} Valenciennes which had {{recently}} passed from the Spanish Netherlands to France. His father, Jean-Philippe Watteau, was a roofer given to brawling. Showing an early interest in painting, Jean-Antoine may have been apprenticed to Jacques-Albert Gérin, a local painter. Jean-Antoine's first artistic subjects were charlatans selling quack remedies on the streets of Valenciennes. Watteau left for Paris in 1702. There he found employment in a workshop at Pont Notre-Dame, making copies of popular genre paintings in the Flemish and Dutch tradition; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> period that he developed his characteristic sketchlike technique.|$|E

25|$|Davies {{has played}} a number of guitars over time, the most {{recognizable}} of which is his Gibson Flying V. Davies bought it in 1965, and soon began appearing live and on TV performances with it. Davies {{was one of the}} few guitarists who played Flying Vs at the time. <b>It</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> period, out of issue due to lack of interest upon its 1958 test release, and models were numbered.

25|$|Included in {{his design}} was a frieze sculpted by Caspar Buberl. Because a {{sculpture}} {{of that size}} was well out of Meigs's budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes, totaling 69 feet (21 m) in length, which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous 1,200-foot (365-m) parade of over 1,300 figures. Because of the 28 sections' modification and mixture, {{it is only in}} careful examination that the frieze is seen to be the same figures repeated several times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as {{a good deal of the}} supply and quartermaster functions, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> capacity that Meigs had served during the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term.
