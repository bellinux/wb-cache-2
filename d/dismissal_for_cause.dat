In the fall of 2006, as chair of the Budgets, Salaries, and Benefi ts Committee at Albion, he negotiated with Albion’s president concerning a proposed layoff of several tenure track faculty members. Much of Saltzman’s research has focused on labor relations law, labor relations in higher education and the public sector, and health policy. His work has been published in Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Transportation Journal, and the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In 2007, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health published a book he co-authored about truck driver occupational safety and health. Job security is a vital concern for many employees. Losing a job can be fi nancially burdensome; the loss may involve a period of unemployment while searching for work and additional expenses for job hunting and relocation.

40|$|Universities are {{extremely}} reluctant to dismiss tenured professors for incompetence. This reluctance compromises the convincing and broadly accepted {{justification for the}} protection of academic freedom through tenure set forth in the 1915 Declaration of Principles of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). After asserting that society benefits from the academic freedom of professors to express their professional views without fear of dismissal, the 1915 Declaration maintained that the grant of permanent tenure following a probationary period of employment protects academic freedom. Yet the 1915 Declaration also stressed that academic freedom does not extend to expression that fails to meet professional standards. Nor, it added, does permanent tenure prevent <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>cause,</b> which could include “professional incompetency” as well as misconduct. It reasoned that only fellow faculty members have the expertise to determine departures from professional standards. It, therefore, insisted that a professor is entitled to a hearing by a committee of faculty peers before being dismissed and that professors have an “obligation” to serve on these committees...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 What {{people believe}} often guides their actions. Within higher education, beliefs about {{academic}} freedom and tenure may guide {{some of the}} behaviors of both administrators and faculty members. Role theory suggests that faculty members and administrators, because of their different roles within the institution, may have differing opinions, attitudes, and expectancies. This study surveyed the attitudes and opinions about academic freedom and tenure of a sample of administrators and faculty in community colleges in Washington State. A self-administered mailed questionnaire was used. Results are described and comparisons are made between {{the responses of the}} two groups and between subsets of each group. Interaction effects of race/ethnicity and gender were analyzed. Differences between minorities and whites were examined as well as differences between females and males. Effects of current experience, total experience, age, and level of education were measured. A factor analysis identified nine factors related to academic freedom and tenure: Importance and Impact, Understandability, Professional Autonomy, Classroom Autonomy, Dismissal for Wrongful Behavior, General Freedom of Speech, <b>Dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>Cause,</b> Student Rights, and Academic Speech. The major research finding for this study suggests that the set of administrators with and without previous faculty experience disagree with the set of faculty members with and without previous administrator experience on factors related to the importance and impact of academic freedom, professional autonomy, and classroom autonomy. This disagreement is similarly evident between administrators without previous faculty experience when compared with faculty without previous administrator experience. Faculty members believe academic freedom and tenure are important principles while administrators do not believe they are. Faculty members believe they have rights that prevent administration from controlling curriculum, grades, and off-campus teaching and consultation activities while administrators do not believe faculty members have these rights. Faculty members believe they have rights that prevent administration from controlling teaching methods and grading polices while administrators do not believe faculty members have these rights. No interaction effects for race/ethnicity or gender were found. Differences were noted between minorities and whites and between females and males. Current experience, total experience, age, and level of education may influence some responses...|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} {{about the effects of}} dismissals-for-cause requirements, a specific component of employment protection legislation that has received little attention. We study a quasi-natural experiment generated by a law introduced in Portugal: out of the 12 paragraphs in the law that dictated the costly procedure required <b>for</b> <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> <b>cause,</b> eight did not apply to small firms. Using matched employer-employee longitudinal data and difference-in-differences methods, we examine the impact of that differentiated change in firing costs upon several variables {{over a long period of}} time. In our results, we do not find robust evidence of effects on job or worker flows, although some estimates suggest a slight increase in hirings. On the other hand, firms that gain flexibility in their dismissals exhibit consistently slower wage growth and sizeable increases in their relative performance. Our findings suggest that reducing firing costs of the type studied here increase workers' effort and reduce their bargaining power. Employment protection legislation, worker flows, wages, firm performance...|$|R

The plurality had provided little guidance in that area.

2500|$|The implied-contract {{theory to}} {{circumvent}} at-will employment {{must be treated}} with caution. [...] In 2006, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Matagorda County Hospital District v. Burwell held that a provision in an employee handbook stating that <b>dismissal</b> may be <b>for</b> <b>cause,</b> and requiring employee records to specify the reason for termination, did not modify an employee's at-will employment. The New York Court of Appeals, that state’s highest court, also rejected the implied-contract theory to circumvent employment at will. [...] In Anthony Lobosco, Appellant v. New York Telephone Company/NYNEX, Respondent, the court restated the prevailing rule that an employee could not maintain an action for wrongful discharge where state law recognized neither the tort of wrongful discharge, nor exceptions for firings that violate public policy, and an employee's explicit employee handbook disclaimer preserved the at-will employment relationship. [...] And in the same 2000 decision mentioned above, the Supreme Court of California held that the length of an employee's long and successful service, standing alone, is not evidence {{in and of itself}} of an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate except <b>for</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|R

40|$|Four of the better-known unfair {{dismissal}} cases involve <b>dismissals</b> of employees <b>for</b> behaviour outside work. All {{four of those}} dismissals were held to be ‘fair’. This paper looks afresh at {{the subject matter of}} <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> behaviour outside work. It will argue, first, that employment tribunals should apply a separate framework to <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> behaviour outside work and not just apply the normal framework that is designed <b>for</b> <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> behaviour at work. Secondly, the paper will construct this separate framework to apply to <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> extramural behaviour. It will be argued that there should henceforth be a presumption that <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> behaviour outside work will be unfair unless the employer has a strong reason for thinking that the extramural behaviour of the employee will damage the business of the employer. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest legal reasons for change to this area of {{unfair dismissal}} law as an addition to previously discussed normative reasons for change. In particular, the paper will develop the analogy between unfair dismissal cases on behaviour outside work and breach of personal confidence cases since the Human Rights Act 1998...|$|R
