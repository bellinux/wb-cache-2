40|$|Functional {{gastrointestinal}} disorders include <b>functional</b> chronic <b>dyspepsia,</b> irritable bowel {{syndrome and}} idiopathic chronic constipation. They are characterized by symptoms which are not associated with evident organic lesions, and can significantly interfere with the patient's quality of life. Although the mechanisms involved in such digestive disturbances are not clear, it is acknowledged {{that the development of}} symptoms is ascribable to alterations of nervous and hormonal mechanisms involved in the regulation of secretory, motor and sensory functions of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been observed that the regular intake of mineral waters with specific electrolyte composition could represent a valuable tool for the adjuvant treatment of functional digestive disorders. In particular, with regard for biliary disorders, it has been observed that high concentrations of sulphate and bicarbonate-alkaline ions are likely to stimulate the choleretic and cholagogue functions, thus improving the biliary outflow. Likewise, bicarbonate-alkaline mineral waters {{have been found to be}} effective in the treatment of gastroduodenal functional disorders, through a normalization of gastric acido-peptic secretion and emptying. In addition, these mineral waters increase the intestinal motility and fecal output, and therefore they may represent valuable therapeutic options for the treatment of {{irritable bowel syndrome}} and idiopathic chronic constipation. Overall, currently available evidence suggests that mineral waters with high content in bicarbonate-alkaline ions could be useful for the treatment of digestive functional disorders. On these bases, the present review has been prepared to discuss currently available data on the effects of mineral waters on functional digestive disorders...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{modalities}} for {{gastro-oesophageal reflux}} disease (GORD) mirror the pathophysiology of the disease. Since acid {{plays a key role}} in GORD-associated mucosal lesions, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the dominant GORD treatment, being the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion available. However, the clinical effectiveness of PPIs varies with the specific symptoms being treated; they are more effective for heartburn than for regurgitation than for extra-oesophageal symptoms. An alternative therapeutic approach to GORD is to prevent the most fundamental cause of reflux symptoms, reflux itself, which most commonly occurs by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (TLOSR). Among potential pharmaceutical agents developed to target TLOSRs, the most advanced are GABA(B) (γ-aminobutyric acid) agonists, which experimentally reduce the occurrence of TLOSRs by about 40 % in both animal and human studies. However, the effectiveness of GABA(B) agonists in clinical trials of patients with GORD with an incomplete response to PPI treatment has been modest. In part, this is probably attributable to the difficult problem of patient selection in these trials. Identifying patients by partial response to PPI treatment results in a heterogeneous population, including those with persistent weakly acidic reflux, patients with visceral hypersensitivity and those with <b>functional</b> heartburn, <b>dyspepsia,</b> or chest pain. From the clinical data available, the best treatment results and, hence, the patients most likely to benefit from reflux inhibitors, are those with persistent reflux, most commonly manifest as persistent regurgitation despite PPI treatment. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background Structural mean models (SMM) {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} treatment efficacy when drug exposure varies. We applied SMM to evaluate the clinical benefits of a proton pump inhibitor prescribed to be taken as needed to alleviate epigastric pain. We also investigated a new diagnostic approach to evaluate model assumptions. Methods All patients were suffering from non-erosive reflux disease or <b>functional</b> ulcer-like <b>dyspepsia</b> and were prescribed a proton pump inhibitor to be taken as needed for relief of epigastric pain. The primary endpoint was a score variable that expresses the magnitude of gastro-intestinal symptoms at 8 weeks after randomization. We developed linear and loglinear versions of the SMM to derive an unbiased estimator of the reduction in symptom score as a function of exposure to the test drug. Semi-parametric models based on splines and corresponding simultaneous confidence bands identified the presence of potential interactions between drug exposure and baseline covariates. Results The on-demand dosing regimen generated a wide range of drug exposure. Application of SMM showed that the potential treatment induced reduction in symptom score was much greater than the average treatment reduction observed in this population of patients. Our diagnostic tool was useful for detecting the interaction between drug exposure and baseline covariates. Limitations Analysis could only be performed over the two first months after randomization because, afterwards, many patients dropped out from the placebo group. Conclusions The structural mean model approach allows one {{to estimate}} treatment efficacy in the presence of variable drug exposure. Similar results were obtained using linear and loglinear SMM.

40|$|Patients with {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) often experience distress, reduced {{quality of}} life, a perceived lack of validation, and an unsatisfactory experience {{with health care}} providers. A health care provider can provide the patient with a framework in which to understand and legitimize their symptoms, remove self-doubt or blame, and identify {{factors that contribute to}} symptoms that the patient can influence or control. This framework is implemented with the consideration of important factors that impact FGIDs, such as gender, age, society, and the patient’s perspective. Although the majority of FGIDs, including globus, rumination syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating, constipation, functional abdominal pain, sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia, pelvic floor dysfunction, and extraintestinal manifestations, are more prevalent in women than in men, <b>functional</b> chest pain, <b>dyspepsia,</b> vomiting, and anorectal pain do not appear to vary by gender.

40|$|Abstract Background Treatment {{objectives}} for dyspepsia include improvements in both symptoms and health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL). There {{is a lack of}} disease-specific instruments measuring HRQoL in South East Asian dyspeptics. Objectives To validate English and locally translated version of the Short-Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI) in Malaysian patients who consult for dyspepsia. Methods The English version of the SF-NDI was culturally adapted locally and a Malay translation was developed using standard procedures. English and Malay versions of the SF-NDI were assessed against the SF- 36 and the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ), examining internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity. Results Pilot testing of the translated Malay and original English versions of the SF-NDI in twenty subjects did not identify any cross-cultural adaptation problems. 143 patients (86 English-speaking and 57 Malay speaking) with dyspepsia were interviewed and the overall response rate was 100 % with nil missing data. The median total SF-NDI score for both languages were 72. 5 and 60. 0 respectively. Test-retest reliability was good with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 90 (English) and 0. 83 (Malay), while internal consistency of SF-NDI subscales revealed α values ranging from 0. 83 – 0. 88 (English) and 0. 83 – 0. 90 (Malay). In both languages, SF-NDI sub-scales and total score demonstrated lower values in patients with more severe symptoms and in patients with <b>functional</b> vs organic <b>dyspepsia</b> (known groups validity), although these were less marked in the Malay language version. There was moderate to good correlation (r = 0. 3 – 0. 6) between all SF-NDI sub-scales and various domains of the SF- 36 (convergent validity). Conclusion This study demonstrates that both English and Malay versions of the SF-NDI are reliable and probably valid instruments for measuring HRQoL in Malaysian patients with dyspepsia. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} re-view of evaluated treatments for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children. Methods. Online bibliographic databases were {{searched for the}} terms “recurrent abdominal pain,” “functional abdominal pain, ” “children, ” or “alternative therapies ” in articles classified as randomized controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interven-tions, outcomes measured, and results. Results. Studies that evaluated famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and pepper-mint oil enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who received the in-terventions when compared with others in control groups. The studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, {{in the case of}} fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. Conclusions. Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies that used famo-tidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeed-back, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famo-tidine, pizotifen, peppermint oil) was targeted to the specific <b>functional</b> gastrointestinal disorder (<b>dyspepsia,</b> abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The be-havioral interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard treat-ment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in RAP. Pediatrics 2003; 111 :e 1 –e 11...|$|R
50|$|Psychosomatic and {{cognitive}} factors {{are important in}} the evaluation of patients with chronic dyspepsia. The psychiatric hypothesis holds that the symptoms of dyspepsia may be due to depression, increased anxiety, or a somatization disorder. Epidemiological studies suggest there is an association between <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> and psychological disorders. Symptoms of neurosis, anxiety, hypochondriasis, and depression are more common in patients being evaluated for unexplained gastrointestinal complaints than in healthy controls. Comparisons of functional and organic dyspepsia have demonstrated that patients with <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> are less likely to have decreased stress or anxiety at 1-year follow-up after being reassured of having no serious disease. This suggests that <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> symptoms are long-lasting, compared with those of organic dyspepsia, and that the emotional ties are strong.|$|E

50|$|In {{a recent}} study, {{patients}} with peptic ulcer disease {{were compared with}} patients with <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> in an age and sex-matched study. Although the <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> group reported more upper abdominal fullness, nausea, and overall greater distress and anxiety, almost all the same symptoms were seen in both groups. Therefore, it is the clinician’s challenging task to separate patients who may have an organic disorder, and thus warrant further diagnostic testing, from patients who have <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia,</b> who are given empiric symptomatic treatment.The workup should be targeted to identify or rule out specific causes. Traditionally, people at high-risk have been identified by “alarm” features. However, the utility of these features in identifying the presence of upper cancer of the esophagus or stomach has been debated. A meta analysis looking at the sensitivity and specificity of alarm features found a range of 0-83% and 40-98%, respectively. However, there was high heterogeneity between studies.|$|E
50|$|The role of Helicobacter pylori in <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia</b> is controversial, and {{no clear}} causal {{relationship}} has been established. This is true for both the symptom profile and pathophysiology of <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia.</b> Although some epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between H. pylori infection and <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia,</b> others have not. The discrepancy may stem in part from differences in methodology and lack of adequate consideration of confounding factors such as past history of peptic ulcer disease and socioeconomic status. Controlled trials disagree {{about whether or not}} H. pylori eradication is beneficial in <b>functional</b> <b>dyspepsia,</b> with roughly half of the trials showing improvement and the other half no improvement. In a recent multicenter U.S. trial that randomized 240 patients to treatment or placebo, and followed patients for 12 months, 28% of treated patients versus 23% of those receiving placebo reported relief of symptoms at the 12-month follow-up. Similarly, recent European trials have not shown significant differences in symptoms after H. pylori eradication as compared with controls. Systematic reviews of eradication have been conducted, with varying results. A systematic review in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggested no statistically significant effect, with an odds ratio (OR) for treatment success versus control of 1.29 (95% CI, 0.89-1.89; P = 0.18). Still, no effect was seen after adjusting for heterogeneity and for cure of H. pylori. In contrast, a Cochrane review found a small but statistically significant effect in curing symptoms (H. pylori cure vs placebo, 36% vs 30%, respectively).|$|E
