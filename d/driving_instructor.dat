40|$|This project {{initially}} {{examines the}} state of driver education up to the turn of this new Century. It details the various changes {{that have been made}} and discusses the changes' now taking place in the industry. It also demonstrates why <b>driving</b> <b>instructors</b> are reluctant to take additional training or qualifications. New drivers and high-mileage company drivers are much more at risk than other road users. This project establishes and identifies areas of support for various pressures to reduce road traffic accidents and road deaths in these groups. Specifically it promotes a Strategic Approach to CPD in the Driver Training Industry. The training programmes and qualifications presented are already being developed, but not enough students take advantage of them. However reinforcement for these ideas is offered by the Driving Standards Agency, which is keen to encourage <b>driving</b> <b>instructors</b> to improve and extend their excellence in the ways they train and re-train their clients to establish safer driving standards. Using reflective research supplemented by survey methodology, this study explores the views and reactions of various <b>driving</b> <b>instructors</b> to CPD and examines what policies, provisions and practices are needed to make it happen. The study is intended to lay the foundations for further action research which will take up various suggestions such as a research library. The study will assist policy makers and providers in the driver training industry and will inform <b>driving</b> <b>instructors</b> of opportunities and provisions for CPD...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade it has become {{increasingly}} popular to ride a motorcycle in Sweden. A mandatory risk education for competence A and A 1 was introduced from the 1 st of November 2009. Since the education is new, few evaluations have been conducted so far. This study evaluates the risk education for motorcyclists based on the perspective of <b>driving</b> <b>instructors.</b> The goal was to compile the instructors' comments and experiences with respect to the new risk training. An additional objective was to examine the driving instructors' perceived effects of the education on their students' driving behavior. Six semi-structured interviews with <b>driving</b> <b>instructors</b> and an observational study of the education at various driving schools were conducted. In addition, a participant observation study was performed during a further education of 15 <b>driving</b> <b>instructors.</b> The results show that the instructors experience a great need for the new risk training and that the implementation of the training itself has been good. Students have been referring to the risk training, which according to the instructors indicate that the students have embraced the essence of the training. As a result, the students drive more carefully now and think twice in certain situations according to the instructors. This was considered a desirable result...|$|R

The show soon became an annual event and later moved to the German city of Essen in 1970, shortly after Rindt's death, and remains there as the Essen Motor Show. Rindt, {{with the help of}} Ecclestone, was able to successfully promote himself, including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts. Following his ascent in racing, two race tracks were built in Austria, the Österreichring (now Red Bull Ring), for which Rindt worked as a consultant, and the Salzburgring. Rindt's popularity was further increased through the TV show Motorama, which he hosted. The monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads, reports from Grands Prix and interviews of fellow drivers by Rindt.|$|E
