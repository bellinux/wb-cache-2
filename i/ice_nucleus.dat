Filter samples collected in Cape Verde over the period 2009 – 2013 are analyzed with a drop freezing experiment sensitive to detect the few, rare <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> active at low supercooling. The data-set is augmented with continuous flow diffusion chamber (SPIN) measurements at temperatures below − 24  °C from a two month field campaign at Cape Verde in 2016. The data set is used to address the questions: What are typical concentrations of ice nucleating particles active at a certain temperature, what affects their concentration, what is their composition and where are their sources? To investigate what the most common <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> are and to identify the sources, bulk chemical aerosol composition obtained from the utilized filter samples is tested for correlations with <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration. It is shown that no significant correlation between the rare <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the bulk aerosol chemical composition, which could serve as tracer for a specific aerosol class e. g. of maritime origin, can be made. Concentration of <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> is found to increase exponentially with decreasing temperature. It indicates that several groups of particles with different ice nucleation properties (size, composition) are contributing to the <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration at different temperatures. The concentration of <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> active at a specific temperature varies over a wide range. The frequency with which a certain <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration is measured within this range is found to follow a log-normal distribution. The log-normal frequency distribution {{can be explained by}} random dilution associated with turbulent, long-distance transport. To investigate the geographic origin of <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei,</b> source attribution of air masses from dispersion modeling is used to classify the data into 7 typical situations.

40|$|The {{amount of}} ice present in mixed-phase clouds, which contain both {{supercooled}} liquid water droplets and ice particles, affects cloud extent, lifetime, particle size and radiative properties.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{methods were}} used to assess the ice {{nucleating}} ability of different AgI-based aerosols produced using two solution combustion generators. The standard method employed was an isothermal cloud chamber which has been historically used for "calibrations " of <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> aerosol generators. Comparisons with historical data showed consistency over a 20 year period for one generator, but not for another. Data on rates of ice crystal formation {{were used to}} infer operative ice formation mechanisms, and make inferences to the relative utility of the different aerosols in the atmosphere. Comparative measurements of <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> effectiveness at- 20 °C were made using two NCAR counters that have been used operationally to trace the aerosols tested. Results showed that these devices can give self-consistent results and typically measure about 33 % of the ice nuclei measured in the larger cloud chamber and 25 % of the total AgI aerosols present. These results varied depending on the <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> aerosol tested, presumably due to differences in particle size and chemistry. Measurements of the ice-forming ability of one aerosol (AgC 10. zzI 0. 78 - 0. 125 NaCl) were also made with a continuous flow ice-thermal diffusion chamber. These measurements howed that the water supersaturation dependence of the ice formation rate by condensation-freezing for these aerosols varies by more than three orders of magnitude between 0 and 7 % supersaturation.

40|$|Electrically induced <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{formation}} {{describes the}} effect of an on-demand <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> generation in a supercooled aqueous solution. The nucleus forms at the surface of an electrode when a high voltage pulse is applied. Even though this effect {{has been known for}} more than 50 years, the possible underlying mechanism is still discussed controversially. In cryobiology the supercooling of a sample is an important parameter since it determines the temperature changes inside the sample and thus the ice crystal structure that develops during the freezing process. In this thesis the basic principles of the electrically induced <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> formation and the potential for an application in the field of cryopreservation and freeze drying are investigated. At first, systematic experimental investigations are performed to find the parameters influencing the electrically induced nucleation. One important parameter which hinders the nucleus formation is the presence of additives like salts and cryoprotective agents, as shown in this work. Especially in respect to an application in cryobiology, where these additives are essential for cell survival, this is an critical issue. The critical field strength which is necessary for <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> generation in pure water was determined experimentally to be 3 * 10 ^ 9 V/m at a temperature of – 1 °C. Comparing this result to the value derived by a specially developed thermodynamic model there is good agreement. In contrast to many other models found in literature, the approach used in this work is based on the energetic favorability of <b>ice</b> <b>nucleus</b> formation in an electric field. The energy is reduced during the phase change of the system. Based on this thermodynamical description of the system, the influence of the investigated experimental parameters is discussed. The new development of a special electrode cap makes it possible to start crystallization reliably in aqueous solutions, even those containing salts and additives. Thus, for the first time electrically induced nucleation {{can be applied to the}} field of cryobiology. The post-cryopreservation cell survival for human fibroblasts and human progenitor cells (CD 34 +) can be increased significantly by the optimization of nucleation temperature through systematic parameter variation. The comparison of experimental results with a simulation of the water transport through the cell membrane helps to explain the mechanisms of cell damage at suboptimal nucleation temperatures. Freeze drying is a further potential field of application for electrically induced nucleation. It is shown in this thesis that the drying time of a freeze drying process can be drastically reduced by a minimized supercooling during the freezing process. For the chosen freeze drying parameters, the freeze drying time could be reduced to approximately half the value compared to uncontrolled nucleation. The analysis of the sample structure shows that a different sample morphology develops during the freezing process. This structure is advantageous for drying and leads to a reduced drying time...|$|E

Residual lee nuclei were found in the experimental area [...] an average oF 7. 5 hours for ground seeders and 4. 6 hours For airborne seeders [...] following seeding activities. Stability, wind direction, and cloud top temperatures were found to be the meteorological conditions most closely related to <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentrations although this could not be shown through the use of statistical tests...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{measurements}} of aerosol and <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> (IN) at a Central European mountain site during {{an episode of}} dust transport from the Sahara are presented. <b>Ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> were sampled by electrostatic precipitation on silicon wafers and were analyzed in an isothermal static vapor diffusion chamber. The transport of mineral dust is simulated by the Eulerian regional dust model DREAM. <b>Ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> and mineral dust are significantly correlated, in particular IN number concentration and aerosol surface area. The ice nucleating characteristics of the aerosol as analyzed with respect to temperature and supersaturation are similar during the dust episode than {{during the course of}} the year. This suggests that dust may be a main constituent of ice nucleating aerosols in Central Europe...|$|R
50|$|Water {{droplets}} commonly {{remain as}} liquid water {{and do not}} freeze, even well below 0 C. <b>Ice</b> <b>nuclei</b> that may be present in an atmospheric droplet become active for ice formation at specific temperatures in between 0 C and -38 C, depending on nucleus geometry and composition. Without <b>ice</b> <b>nuclei,</b> supercooled water droplets (as well as any extremely pure liquid water) can exist down to about -38 C, at which point spontaneous freezing occurs.|$|R
