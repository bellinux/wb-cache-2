5|$|In March 2003, Huntsman {{resigned}} {{his post}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, {{decided not to}} run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{bought the}} Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later.

5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Byrne {{initially}} {{struggled with}} writer's block, but soon adopted a scattered stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for Remain in Light was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted {{with the help}} of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M. Talking Heads expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side-projects. The album was the last of the band's collaborations with Eno, though Eno and Byrne's My Life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> of Ghosts would be released the following year.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before {{heard of such a}} practice.|$|E
5|$|Three days of {{cold weather}} and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Edmond Van der Meersch led {{an attack on}} the brook. One Belgian {{lieutenant}} went scouting alone in no man's land and was killed in an ambush. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E
5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix of My Life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written {{but that did not}} have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.|$|E

5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E
5|$|Ted Serong {{was born}} in the suburb of Abbotsford in Melbourne on 11 November 1915, the first child of William and Mabel Serong. His father was of Portuguese {{heritage}} from the island of Madeira; the family had first settled in Australia in 1824. An apprentice blacksmith, William had served in the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and later the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) in France during the First World War, before specializing in the maintenance of weapons and engineering stores, and working for the Department of Defence as a quality control engineer. Serong's younger brother, Raymond, {{was born in}} 1917. William believed in physical fitness and discipline, and he taught both of his sons to box, as well as to scout, shoot rabbits, and live off the land. Between 1930 and 1932, during the Great Depression, the boys lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> for extended periods, relying on their hunting skills to survive.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She {{fell in love with}} a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.|$|E

5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Wentworth Wills (19 August 1835– 2 May 1880) was a sportsman who is {{credited}} with being Australia's first cricketer of significance and a founder of Australian rules football.
