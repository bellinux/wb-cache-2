40|$|Although {{social capital}} have been {{hypothesized}} to have {{positive influence on}} psychological health, few papers found a relationship between social capital dimensions and psychological wellbeing. This study investigates the longitudinal relationship between social participation <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> and self-rated psychological health. The paper uses five waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) that follows the same individuals between 1991 and 1995. Ordered logit fixed effect methods {{have been used to}} study the longitudinal link between structural social capital (being member, active, and both member and active <b>in</b> <b>associations)</b> and self-rated psychological health assessed by single items of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) controlling for age, marital status, household size, number of children, education, income, economic status, number of visit to GP or family doctor. The paper shows that being both member and active <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> is linked to all “positive” items of self-rated psychological health and to two main “negative” items of psychological wellbeing. Instead, being only member or only active <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> have no statistical effect on single items of the GHQ- 12, with few exceptions. Findings highlight the protective role of being both member and active <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> against poor psychological health outcomes...|$|R

This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between social participation <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> and self-rated psychological health. The paper uses five waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) from 1991 to 1995 (unbalanced panel N = 45761). Ordered logit fixed effect methods were used to study the longitudinal link between structural social capital (being a member, active, and both a member and active <b>in</b> <b>associations)</b> and self-rated psychological health assessed by single items of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) controlling for age, marital status, household size, number of children, education, income, economic status, number of visits to the GP and health problems. The paper shows that being only a member and only active <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> has no statistical relationship with almost all the items of the GHQ- 12. Instead, being both a member and active <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> is linked to all “positive” items of self-rated psychological health and to two main “negative” items of psychological wellbeing.

Three types of civic engagement are considered: participation in all types of civic <b>associations,</b> <b>in</b> <b>associations</b> for immigrants and <b>in</b> non-immigrant <b>associations.</b> The article investigates whether immigrants coming from countries with higher levels of civic participation are more likely to participate <b>in</b> civic <b>associations</b> and if immigrants who have lived longer in and stayed in closer contact with a home country with a higher level of civic participation are more likely to join civic associations. Data used come from the Spanish National Immigrant Survey (2007) and the World Values Survey (2000, 2005). The results of multilevel logistic regressions show that immigrants who have spent more time in a more participatory context at origin and who are in closer contact with these societies are more likely to get involved <b>in</b> civic <b>associations</b> at destination.
