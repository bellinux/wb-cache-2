5|$|Symmetry <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose {{adults do}} not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move {{in one direction}} necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be). More puzzling {{is the reason for}} the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E
