Using the technique of cross consistency assessment (CCA) (Ritchey, 2002), the system however does allow for reduction, not by {{reducing the number of}} variables involved, but by reducing the number of possible solutions through the elimination of the illogical solution combinations in a <b>grid</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
40|$|Attribution of {{observed}} atmospheric carbon concentrations {{to emissions}} on the country, state or city level is often inferred using "inversion" techniques. Such computations are often performed using advanced mathematical techniques, such as synthesis inversion or four-dimensional variational analysis, that invoke tracing observed atmospheric concentrations backwards through a transport model {{to a source}} region. It is, to date, not well understood how well such techniques can represent fine spatial (and temporal) structure in the inverted flux fields. This question is addressed using forward-model computations with idealized tracers emitted at the surface in {{a large number of}} <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> over selected regions and examining how distinctly these emitted tracers can be detected downstream. Initial results show that tracers emitted in half-degree <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> over a large region of the Eastern USA cannot be distinguished from each other, even at short distances over the Atlantic Ocean, when they are emitted in <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> separated by less than five degrees of latitude - especially when only total-column observations are available.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 51). This thesis addresses {{two approaches}} {{to describe the}} complexity of US climate data. The basis for our analyses is provided by a partition of the contiguous United States into 120 <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> of size 2 : 5 ?? x 3 : 5 ?? by latitude and longitude, respectively. The first part deals with the determination of spatial degrees of freedom (DOF) for monthly United States Historical Climatology Network, version 2 (USHCN V 2) temperature and precipitation data from 1961 to 1990. The DOF {{can be interpreted as}} the effective number of statistically independent spatial locations of a climate field. The X?? and S methods are used to estimate the DOFs for each month and four different data sets. Estimates from the S method suggest that around two to six <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> suffice to explain temperature data while precipitation data is more complex and requires 6 to 30 <b>grid</b> <b>boxes.</b> The X?? method apparently underestimates the DOF in most cases but agrees with the S method in that climate in the summer months is affected by more independent influences than in the winter months. Based on the results from the S method three different methods are used to find the supposedly most independent subsets of <b>grid</b> <b>boxes.</b> Each method computes a value of interest for all underlying subsets. The X?? and S DOF maximization methods find the subset with the highest DOF value from the respective DOF estimation method if only data from the considered subset is used for estimation. The correlation minimization method minimizes a so-called correlation value. By visual judgment most of the determined subsets depict a fairly uniform distribution. The second part starts by discussing theory on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and gives an example of their application to a linear regression model. Subsequently an optimal average method is introduced which serves to determine optimal weights for empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) in the approximation of mean squared errors (MSE) between theoretical values of temperature anomaly averages and a discrete sum to compute them in practice using the partition of the contiguous US into <b>grid</b> <b>boxes.</b> The AIC and BIC criteria are applied to MSEs computed for USHCN V 2 temperature data from 1897 to 2010 in an attempt to determine optimal modes, i. e. cutoff points for the MSE approximation. Based on the results an inconsistency in the theory is discovered: the idea of MSEs considered in the optimal average method doesn't correspond to MSEs in a regression model. Thus AIC and BIC are not appropriate to determine the optimal modes...|$|R

Significant warming trends are found at a large fraction of the individual <b>grid</b> <b>boxes</b> over the globe, a much larger fraction than {{can be explained by}} internal climate variations.

5000|$|GCM cloud parameterizations {{account for}} at least two cloud types: {{convective}} clouds and large-scale supersaturation clouds. [...] "Large-scale supersaturation clouds occur when the relative humidity in a <b>grid</b> <b>box</b> at some model level exceeds a critical value". [...] One way of accounting for large-scale supersaturation clouds is by setting the critical relative humidity value to 80%, assigning grid boxes with relative humidity values at or above 80% as cloud covered. Another way to account for large-scale supersaturation clouds is to benchmark clouds via temperature variability, in that wherever the temperature [...] "causes the relative humidity to reach 100% is cloud covered".|$|E
50|$|Convective clouds follow one {{of three}} general {{parameterization}} schemes. The first scheme is moist adiabatic adjustment. The main advantage of this method {{is that it is}} simple, in that if the moist adiabatic lapse rate is exceeded, moisture and heat within the vertical layer are adjusted so that air within the layer is saturated. In turn the lapse rate is then adjusted to the moist adiabatic lapse rate, conserving energy, raining out excess moisture while not transporting momentum. The disadvantage of this scheme is that it over-estimates convection, as constrains an entire <b>grid</b> <b>box</b> to act in a convective manner, unrealistic in the real atmosphere.|$|E

But in a global climate model, the grid sizes are on the order of 100 x 100 km, and thus can only explicitly resolve large-scale atmospheric motions.

30|$|A {{significant}} percentage of hydrocarbon reservoirs {{around the world is}} fractured. Moreover, the major part of gas reservoirs in Iran is also fractured type, so the existence of an in-house software is necessary. In this study, an efficient, user-friendly, and indigenous simulation of a three-dimensional black oil fractured dry gas reservoir has been developed through IMPES method with the two-phase flow of gas and water. The presented simulator, which was written by C++ language and was known as fracture dry gas reservoir simulator, uses the implicit pressure and explicit saturation method for solving the equations. Also, effect of gravity pressure is neglected and effect of the capillary is considered in equations. By this simulator, we can investigate the dry gas reservoirs behavior with fractures. Darcy or non-Darcy fracture and matrix flow, Cartesian, cylindrical, and combination of Cartesian–cylindrical reservoir gridding, single porosity, dual porosity–single permeability, and dual porosity–dual permeability modeling are abilities of this simulator too. Additionally, this simulator is able to make outputs (such as pressure) at any given specific radius and time interval as numerical and/or graphical output in so little run time. Also, this simulator has PVT <b>box</b> and <b>gridding</b> <b>box</b> for doing the calculation of PVT and <b>gridding.</b> PVT <b>box</b> contains new correlations and EOS in comparison with another reservoir simulator. <b>Gridding</b> <b>box</b> makes us be able to simulate fractured dry gas reservoirs and hydraulically fractured well reservoirs too. Finally, the validity of this simulator was verified by comparing the simulation results with the other reservoir simulator (Eclipse) and showed a good compatibility between the developed software and Eclipse results in each time with different conditions such as various gridding conditions, various fluid data conditions and also various well configuration conditions.|$|R
