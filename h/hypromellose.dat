50|$|<b>Hypromellose</b> {{solutions}} were patented as a semisynthetic {{substitute for}} tear-film. Its molecular structure is predicated upon a base celluloid compound {{that is highly}} water-soluble. Post-application, celluloid attributes of good water solubility reportedly aid in visual clarity. When applied, a <b>hypromellose</b> solution acts to swell and absorb water, thereby expanding {{the thickness of the}} tear-film. <b>Hypromellose</b> augmentation therefore results in extended lubricant time presence on the cornea, which theoretically results in decreased eye irritation, especially in dry climates, home, or work environments. On a molecular level, this polymer contains beta-linked D-glucose units that remain metabolically intact for days to weeks. On a manufacturing note, since <b>hypromellose</b> is a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, it is slightly more expensive to produce due to semisynthetic manufacturing processes. Aside from its widespread commercial and retail availability over the counter in a variety of products, <b>Hypromellose</b> 2% solution has been documented to be used during surgery to aid in corneal protection and during orbital surgery.|$|E
40|$|This thesis evaluates {{and compares}} {{compressibility}} of directly compressible tableting {{materials for the}} preparation of hydrophilic gel matrix tablets containing tramadol hydrochloride. Prosolv® SMCC 90 and Disintequik™ MCC 25 were used as the dry binders. <b>Hypromelloses</b> Methocel™ Premium K 4 M and Methocel™ Premium K 100 M were used in concentrations of 30 % and 50 %. Magnesium stearate {{was used as the}} lubricant in concentration of 1 %. The compressibility was evaluated by means of the energy profile of the compression process and determination of tensile strength of the tablets. The tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90 exhibited the higher values of the total energy of compression than those with Disintequik™ MCC 25 at the same compression forces, tramadol decreased these values slightly. The tableting materials with Disintequik™ MCC 25 exhibited higher values of the total energy of compression in 50 % concentration of both Methocels™. In the case of Prosolv® SMCC 90 the values of plasticity were higher than at tableting materials with Disintequik™ MCC 25, particularly in 30 % concentration of both types of Methocel™. Tramadol decreased the plasticity slightly. The tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90 provided stronger tablets. Tramadol decreased the strength of tablets and the strength values [...] ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hypromellose</b> {{in an aqueous}} solution, unlike methylcellulose, {{exhibits}} a thermal gelation property. That is, when the solution heats up to a critical temperature, the solution congeals into a non-flowable but semi-flexible mass. Typically, this critical (congealing) temperature is inversely related to both the solution concentration of HPMC and the concentration of the methoxy group within the HPMC molecule (which in turn depends on both the degree of substitution of the methoxy group and the molar substitution. That is, the higher the concentration of the methoxy group, the lower the critical temperature. The inflexibility/viscosity of the resulting mass, however, {{is directly related to}} the concentration of the methoxy group (the higher the concentration, the more viscous or less flexible the resulting mass is).|$|E

40|$|Formulation of {{gliclazide}} in {{the form}} of extended-release tablet in 30 and 60 mg dosage forms was performed using <b>hypromellose</b> (HPMC K 4 M) as a retarding agent. Drug-release profiles were investigated in comparison with references Diamicron MR 30 and 60 mg tablets. The effect of size of powder particles, the amount of <b>hypromellose</b> in formulation, hardness of tablets, and also the effect of halving the tablets were investigated on drug release profile. A mathematical model which describes <b>hypromellose</b> behavior in initial times of drug release was proposed for the estimation of <b>hypromellose</b> content in modified-release gliclazide 60 mg tablet. This model is based on erosion of <b>hypromellose</b> in dissolution media. The model is applicable to describe release profiles of insoluble drugs.
