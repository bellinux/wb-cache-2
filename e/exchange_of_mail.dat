The idea behind the catcher pouch was that there could be an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> to villages too small to justify the train stopping. The complete transfer technique (tossing out the outgoing mail a second before grabbing the catcher pouch) required much skill and potentially could cause harm or even death for those not trained properly. Another reason why the catcher pouch and mail crane were developed is so the train did not have to slow down just for the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> ( [...] method).|$|E

Banana visited his house in Brescia with her husband Bill Gaglione. Buster Cleveland filled the city of Ukiah, in California, with Cavellini's stickers. In 1978 Tiziano Marcheselli published {{an article on the}} Gazzetta di Parma in which he presented an iniziative for the beatification of Cavellini by the Center for Cavellinian Studies. Jolena Baldini wrote about Cavellini's artworks and performances on Paese Sera, noting the contrast between the artist's irony and the drama of the present times (anni di piombo, kidnapping of Aldo Moro). Cavellini was also featured in a chapter of the book Contemporary Artists, published in London in the same year. The Croatian magazine Podroom, the Hungarian Muveszet and the American Mamelle, edited by Judith Hoffberg, published articles about him. In 1978 Cavellini participated in the first big Italian exhibition <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art in Mantua, in the house of Andrea Mantegna, with 140 artists from every corner of the world. Cavellini mailed his book Incontri/scontri nella giungla nell'arte to numerous artists and art critics, receiving positive feedback exclusively from outside of Italy.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{almost all}} DoD systems are {{operated}} {{at a single}} level, classified or unclassified. The problems encountered on these single level systems with mail exchange, its storage, and manipulation are the multiple networks and workstations required to handle different security levels of data {{as well as the}} high cost of maintaining them. The Naval Postgraduate School Multilevel Secure Local Area Network (MLS LAN) project supports a high assurance server. This LAN is COTS-driven (commercial-off-the-shelf) and enforces a mandatory security policy while permitting users to employ standard office productivity tools on standard workstations. Initially, there was no means for multilevel mail exchange between clients of the system. This research was to implement the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) server, Sendmail, on the Wang Federal XTS 300 as a multilevel server. A port of a UNIX version of Sendmail 8. 9. 3 was made to the XTS 300. Modifications to Sendmail were required so that it could be supported by the UNIX-like XTS 300 STOP 4. 4. 2 operating system Sendmail proved to be a successful mail server for <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> between system clients.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{adaptation}} of Callon and Law’s (1995) hybrid collectif derived from research conducted on the usage of mobile phones and internet technologies among the iTadian indigenous people of the Cordillera region, northern Philippines. Results brings to light an indigenous digital collectif—an emergent effect from the translation of both human and non-human heterogeneous actors as well as pre-existent networks, such as: traditional knowledge and practices, kinship relations, the traditional exchange of goods, modern academic requisites, and advocacies for indigenous rights. This is evinced by the iTadian’s enrolment of internet and mobile phone technologies. Examples include: treating these technologies as an efficient communicative tool, an indicator of well-being, and a portable extension of affective human relationships. Alternatively, counter-enrolment strategies are also at play, which include: establishing rules of acceptable use on SMS texting and internet access based on traditional notions of discretion, privacy, and the customary treatment of the dead. Within the boundaries of this digital collectif reveal imbrications of pre-existing networks like traditional customs, the kinship system across geophysical boundaries, the traditional <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and other goods, and the advocacy of indigenous rights. These imbrications show that the iTadian digital collectif fluently configures itself {{to a variety of}} networked ontologies without losing its character...|$|E

50|$|As far as ancient {{literary}} {{sources are}} concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. An {{account of the}} Dacian Wars, the Commentarii de bellis Dacicis, written by Trajan himself or a ghostwriter and modelled after Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, is lost {{with the exception of}} one sentence. Only fragments remain of the Getiká, a book by Trajan's personal physician Titos Statilios Kriton. The Parthiká, a 17-volume account of the Parthian Wars written by Arrian, has met a similar fate. Book68 in Cassius Dio's Roman History, which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgments and epitomes, is the main source for the political history of Trajan's rule. Besides this, Pliny the Younger's Panegyricus and Dio of Prusa's orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory perorations, typical of the late Roman era, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact. The tenth volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> official <b>mail,</b> in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile. It is certain that much of text of the letters that appear in this collection over Trajan's signature was written and/or edited by Trajan's Imperial secretary, his ab epistulis. Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation, as well as recourse to non-literary sources such as archaeology and epigraphy.|$|R

40|$|Developing and {{maintaining}} an International Addressing Standard {{is an important}} prerequisite for effective postal operation and for interconnecting the global network. The Post, the end customers and the overall mailing community benefit from well defined addressing standards {{and the use of}} country-based templates. Adopting and using address standards leads to the following benefits: • Improves the value <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> as a means of communication • Provides for the efficient processing <b>of</b> international <b>mail</b> that, with country-specific addressing tools, can result in international mail being processed as efficiently as addressed domestic mail • Fosters the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> postal-related information between postal operators • Promotes the compatibility of UPU and international postal initiatives • Allows the Post to work closely with postal handling organizations, customers, suppliers and other partners, including various international organizations. A primary advantage to having access to country-specific templates reflecting a standardized address format is improved deliverability <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> Properly formatted mail supports automation compatibility, barcode accuracy, carrier route assignments; pre-sort levels, postage payment accuracy, timely and consistent processing, and improved customer satisfaction. From the postal administration viewpoint, the use of complete and correct address information can result in reduced operational and delivery costs. In addition, by improving the efficiency and reliability <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> we improve the value <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> as a communications medium with the overall result being an increase in the volume <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> From the customer viewpoint, complete and correct address information increases the surety that a mailpiece be delivered to the intended recipient without delay.
