25|$|The word satyagraha {{itself was}} coined through a public contest that Gandhi {{sponsored}} through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', {{when he realized}} that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.|$|E

He defended his character's age by characterising him as being loyal to Porter, instead of being incompetent. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character's emotional and intellectual maturity: emotionally, he lacks confidence around women—most notably seen with his unrequited love towards Kirsty—but Smith portrays Danny as a caring and sensitive but [...] "wry, sarcastic, [...] witty" [...] romantic; and intellectually, Danny is portrayed as attentive and possessing a strong work ethic.|$|E
500|$|Weeks {{before the}} release of Independiente, Arjona issued a letter in which <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> past {{relations}} with recording companies. In the letter, he revealed that he entered in his first record label as an exchange, commenting that [...] "a producer, friend of mine, told them [...] that if they don't sign me they won't sign two artists he had [...] ", and that he received the [...] "minimum royalty percentage" [...] out from his most successful albums.

I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them."

500|$|... "Iconic" [...] {{features}} Chance the Rapper and boxer Mike Tyson. The latter has a {{spoken word}} {{introduction to the}} song, similar to his addition on Canibus' debut single, [...] "Second Round K.O." [...] (1998). Madonna invited Tyson to the recording studio where <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> life; he recorded the introduction in one take. Consisting of a [...] "weird" [...] beat, [...] "Iconic" [...] finds Madonna embracing herself as an icon through the lyrics. [...] "HeartBreakCity" [...] follows [...] "Iconic", and is a piano ballad talking about lost love, with Madonna singing in a deeper vocal register, inspired by baroque pop. Containing synths, banjo sounds, and hollow drums, [...] "Body Shop" [...] describes love as a damaged car on the highway, requiring a body repair to be alive. West also produced the next track, [...] "Holy Water", where the singer compares her bodily fluids to the title. With hedonistic sound effects, the song is reminiscent of Madonna's 1990 single, [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and contains a lyrical excerpt from [...] "Vogue". A bassline accompanies the chorus, consisting of moaning sounds, arcade game music, and synths. [...] "Inside Out" [...] was produced by Mike Dean, and features Madonna's vocals with reverb, accompanied by piano sounds and restrained chords. [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] follows, and is the last track on the standard version of the album. Baroque piano sounds, and a steady military beat, lead up to the chorus as Madonna sings about the world changing, heartbreaks, and acceptance. A gospel choir and minimum synths back the song's sound.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet {{ambassador}} to Afghanistan, {{was able to}} persuade Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Sherjan Mazdoryar {{to become part of}} a conspiracy against Amin. These three men put pressure on Taraki, who by this time believed that [...] "he really was the 'great leader'", to sack Amin from office. It is unknown if Amin knew anything about the conspiracy against him, but it was after the cabinet reorganisation that <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> dissatisfaction. On 26 March the PDPA Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the extension of the powers of the executive branch, and the establishment of the Homeland Higher Defence Council (HHDC) to handle security matters. Many analysts of the day regarded Amin's appointment as Prime Minister as an increase in his powers at the expense of Taraki. However, the reorganisation of the cabinet and the strengthening of Taraki's position as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, had reduced the authority of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was, due to the strengthening of the executive, now appointed by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. While Amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers, he needed Taraki's consent to actually do so. Another problem for Amin was that while the Council of Ministers was responsible to the Revolutionary Council and its chairman, individual ministers were only responsible to Taraki. When Amin became Prime Minister, he was responsible for planning, finance and budgetary matters, the conduct of foreign policy, and for order and security. The order and security responsibilities had been taken over by the HHDC, which was chaired by Taraki. While Amin was HHDC Deputy Chairman, the majority of HHDC members were members of the anti-Amin faction. For instance, the HHDC membership included Watanjar the Minister of National Defence, Interior Minister Mazdoryar, the President of the Political Affairs of the Armed Forces Mohammad Iqbal, Mohammad Yaqub, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the Afghan Air Force Nazar Mohammad and Assadullah Sarwari the head of ASGA, the Afghan secret police.|$|E
