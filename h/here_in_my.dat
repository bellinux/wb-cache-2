But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{opinion is}} the only imaginative prose-writer of the {{slightest}} value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, {{it will probably be}} admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.|$|E

500|$|Domestically, the Cold War {{was in the}} {{forefront}} of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed [...] "I have <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand a list" [...] of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department. McCarthy made the claim in The Wheeling speech. In September 1950, the USCongress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer.|$|E
500|$|Inside Venom's {{tour bus}} (the first time Slayer {{had been in}} one) the band members got drunk with Venom, while {{listening}} to Hell Awaits. Araya entered the bus [...] "hammered out of his mind," [...] according to Lombardo, saying [...] "I gotta take a piss! Where's the bathroom in this thing?" [...] Venom singer Conrad [...] "Cronos" [...] Lant responded, saying [...] "Right here—right <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth!" [...] Araya took it almost literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a black eye. Araya will not discuss the incident other than {{saying that he was}} drunk {{and it was a very}} disrespectful thing to do.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. I have <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E

500|$|McCarthy's {{involvement}} with the ongoing cultural phenomenon that would bear his name began with a speech he made on Lincoln Day, February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia.

McCarthy is usually quoted as saying: [...] "I have <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." [...] This speech resulted in a flood of press attention to McCarthy and established the path that {{made him one of the}} most recognized politicians in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "Listen" [...] is a soul-R ballad, {{which is}} written in the key of B major, and set in common time at a {{moderately}} slow groove of 62 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of F3 to G5. The song's music takes its instrumentation from the bass, celli, drums, guitars, keyboards, percussion, violas, and violins. According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, its lyrics make reference to tenacity, love, and the refusal to defer dreams; Beyoncé, as the female protagonist, sings, [...] "demanding her moment in the sun". Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé shimmers [...] "with evocative emotion", rising to new heights alongside [...] "a golden melody with spellbinding, rafter-raising production". The lyrics are written in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with the lines: [...] "Listen to the song <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, a melody I start but can't complete". A bridge follows after repeating the pattern and ends in another chorus.|$|E
500|$|Smith, {{a farmer}} from the Midlands town of Selukwe {{who had been}} seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first {{native-born}} Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a [...] "raw colonial"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it [...] "brutal", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as [...] "a suicide squad... {{not interested in the}} welfare of all the people but only in their own". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black nationalist rule and apartheid so that there would still be [...] "a place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that the government should be based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist government <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifetime".|$|E

You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the Southern Rhodesian press {{predicted}} that Smith would not last long; one column called him [...] "a momentary man", {{thrust into the}} spotlight by the RF's dearth of proven leaders. His only real rival to replace Field had been William Harper, an ardent segregationist who had headed the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian branch during the Federal years. Some reporters predicted Welensky's imminent introduction to Southern Rhodesian politics {{at the head of}} an RF–UFP coalition government, but Welensky showed little interest in this idea, saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an RF-dominated House. The RF's replacement of Field with Smith drew criticism from the British Labour leader Harold Wilson, who called it [...] "brutal", while JB Johnston, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet Smith for two weeks after he took office. The ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo branded the new Smith Cabinet [...] "a suicide squad... interested not in the welfare of all the people but only in their own", and {{predicted that}} the RF would [...] "eventually destroy themselves". Asserting that a lasting [...] "place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia would benefit all of the country's people, the new Prime Minister said the government should be based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist government <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifetime".|$|E
500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special and I was a little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special night. When I moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> present role was a special occasion." [...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark McMenamin, a {{professor}} of geology, quotes {{a section of the}} book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed.
