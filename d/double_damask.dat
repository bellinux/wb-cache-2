I was a-tellin' Sally that I could do as well once myself, but my mantle was a-fallin' on her. Sally don't seem to act {{a bit like a}} disap'inted gal. She is as chipper as she can be about Mara's weddin', and seems like she couldn't do too much. But laws, {{everybody}} seems to want to be a-doin' for her. Miss Emily was a-showin' me a fine <b>double</b> <b>damask</b> tablecloth that she was goin' to give her; and Mis' Pennel, she's been a-spinnin' and layin' up sheets and towels and tablecloths all her life,--and then she has all Naomi's things. Mis' Pennel was talkin' to me the other day about bleachin' 'em out 'cause they'd got yellow a-lyin'. I kind o' felt as if 'twas unlucky to be a-fittin' out a bride with her dead mother's things, but I didn't like to say nothin'." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{setting is}} a cruise around the world, {{featuring}} 25 musical numbers at various locations: a London store, an African jungle ("Hottentot Potentate"), a Balkan country where Powell taps spy messages, and a West Indies dockside for [...] "Loadin' Time", {{to mention a}} few. The revue gave Bea Lillie the range {{of a variety of}} exotic locations. She had the tongue-twister lines [...] "two dozen <b>double</b> <b>damask</b> dinner napkins"; became a Russian ballerina who could not [...] "face the mujik"; and disrupted the line of geisha girls with [...] "It's better with your shoes off" [...] in a Japanese garden. In [...] "Paree", she was a Parisian grisette in the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and [...] "made something of a carnival of this song, with lyrics like 'I kiss your right bank, I kiss your left bank; kiss Montparnasse' with the emphasis on the last syllable." ...|$|E
5000|$|In her revues, she {{utilized}} sketches, {{songs and}} parody that won her lavish praise from The New York Times after her 1924 New York début in André Charlot's Revue of 1924, starring Gertrude Lawrence. In {{some of her}} best known bits, she would solemnly parody the flowery performing style of earlier decades, mining such songs as [...] "There are Fairies at the Bottom of our Garden" [...] and [...] "Mother Told Me So" [...] for every double entendre, while other numbers ("Get Yourself a Geisha" [...] and [...] "Snoops the Lawyer", for example) showcased her exquisite sense of the absurd. Her performing in such comedy routines as [...] "One Dozen <b>Double</b> <b>Damask</b> Dinner Napkins", (in which an increasingly flummoxed matron attempts to purchase said napkins) earned her the frequently used sobriquet of [...] "Funniest Woman in the World". She never performed the [...] "Dinner Napkins" [...] routine in Britain, because British audiences had already seen it performed by the Australian-born English revue performer Cicely Courtneidge, for whom it was written.|$|E
