While journalists and other news media experts may indeed see value in linking, that optimism is tempered by levels of caution and worry, suggesting a need for media scholars, journalists, and news organization to re-evaluate the deployment of links within the news proces...|$|E
40|$|Adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ASC) are {{multipotent}} stem cells that show great {{potential as a}} cell source for osteogenic tissue replacements and {{it is critical to}} understand the underlying mechanisms of lineage specification. Here we explore the role of primary cilia in human ASC (hASC) differentiation. This study focuses on the chemosensitivity of the primary cilium and the action of its associated proteins: polycystin- 1 (PC 1), polycystin- 2 (PC 2) and intraflagellar transport protein- 88 (IFT 88), in hASC osteogenesis. To elucidate cilia-mediated mechanisms of hASC differentiation, siRNA knockdown of PC 1, PC 2 and IFT 88 was performed to disrupt cilia-associated protein function. Immunostaining of the primary cilium structure indicated phenotypic-dependent changes in cilia morphology. hASC cultured in osteogenic differentiation media yielded cilia of a more elongated conformation than those cultured in <b>expansion</b> <b>media,</b> indicating cilia-sensitivity to the chemical environment and a relationship between the cilium structure and phenotypic determination. Abrogation of PC 1, PC 2 and IFT 88 effected changes in both hASC proliferation and differentiation activity, as measured through proliferative activity, expression of osteogenic gene markers, calcium accretion and endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Results indicated that IFT 88 may be an early mediator of the hASC differentiation process with its knockdown increasing hASC proliferation and decreasing Runx 2, alkaline phosphatase and BMP- 2 mRNA expression. PC 1 and PC 2 knockdown affected later osteogenic gene and end-product expression. PC 1 knockdown resulted in downregulation of alkaline phosphatase an...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Interest in adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ASCs) has {{increased}} in recent years due to their multi-linage differentiation capabilities. While much {{work has been done}} to optimize the differentiation media, few studies have focused on examining the influence of different <b>expansion</b> <b>media</b> on cell behavior. In this study, three basal media (low glucose Dulbecco 2 ̆ 7 s modified Eagle 2 ̆ 7 s medium (DMEM), high glucose DMEM and DMEM-F 12) supplemented with or without fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF) were examined to assess their suitability for expanding ASCs. FINDINGS: Flow cytometry, colony-forming unit assays (CFU-Fs) and differentiation assays were utilized to study cell behavior. High glucose media CFU-Fs produced fewest colonies while the addition of FGF increased colony size. By passage 2, the majority of cells were positive for CD 44, 45, 73, 90 and 105 and negative for CD 14, 31 and 45, indicating a mesenchymal phenotype. A sub-population of CD 34 positive cells was present among passage 2 cells; however, by passage 4 the cells were negative for CD 34. FGF has a negative effective on passage 4 ASC adipogenesis and high glucose media plus FGF-enhanced osteogenic capacity of passage 4 ASCs. FGF supplemented basal media were most suitable for chondrogenesis. High glucose media plus FGF appeared to be the most beneficial for priming ASCs to induce a keratocyte phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the reciprocal effect FGF and basal media have on ASCs. This research has implications for those interested regenerating bone, cartilage, cornea or adipose tissues...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and {{research}} question: In the global media field, global expansion {{has become more}} common and {{is a way for}} media companies to reach out to a broader audience. Both advantages and disadvantages come with a global expansion and there are several cultural differences that have to be considered. This thesis will deal with the cultural differences and discuss how a Swedish media company efficiently goes about establishing in Vietnam. This leads us to this thesis' research question: How does a Swedish media company succeed in Vietnam?   Purpose: This thesis' purpose is to find out what media companies do to successfully acclimate to the Vietnamese culture and the important aspects of the cultural differences to consider. Delimitation: In order to present a thesis with greater depth and acquire a deeper understanding, the study is limited to examine Swedish media companies and what intercultural aspects are important to consider when establishing in Vietnam.   Method: The research we have done is based on interviews, which we thought could give us the accurate information and a good base to stand on. We have interviewed five people who, in different ways, {{have something to do with}} Vietnam's media or intercultural communication. The interview question is based on the information we have found in the theory chapter. The interviews gave us a deeper understanding about the subject and lead to interesting answers that could help us answer our research question.   Conclusion: There are many things a company needs to think about when setting up an establishment in a new county. In our study we have found out the differences between Vietnam and Sweden and we have examined the most suitable way for a company to communicate with the market in Vietnam. This thesis can be seen as a guideline for media companies in Sweden that are going to expand their organization to the Vietnamese market.   Keywords: intercultural communication, Vietnam, global <b>expansion,</b> <b>media</b> companies, foreign establishment...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveGrowth {{factors can}} profoundly affect the {{behaviour}} of chondrocytes during expansion and subsequent growth in three-dimensional (3 -D) scaffolds. Prolonging such effects has stimulated {{investigation of the}} transfer of growth factor genes to chondrocytes. This study evaluated {{the effects of the}} monolayer expansion medium on the proliferation and cartilage matrix molecule synthesis of chondrocytes in 3 -D pellet culture and in type II collagen–glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds, and on ex vivo insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) gene transfer to articular chondrocytes in monolayer. The possibility of transfecting cells in 3 -D culture using CG scaffolds was also investigated and the resulting effect of IGF- 1 overexpression on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis in 3 -D culture was assessed. MethodsTwo <b>expansion</b> <b>media</b> were compared—one that has been widely used for growing chondrocytes (Medium  1) and one that has been found to increase chondrocyte proliferation rates and preserve the redifferentiation potential of monolayer-expanded chondrocytes when subsequently placed in pellet cultures (Medium 2). Chondrocytes were expanded in monolayer culture and then 1) redifferentiated in 3 -D culture, or 2) infected with the IGF- 1 gene in monolayer or in type II CG scaffolds. ResultsThe cell count for first passage chondrocytes was more than 3 -fold higher when using Medium 2. In 3 -D culture, cells expanded with Medium 2 and seeded in CG scaffolds produced more total GAG/DNA and displayed more intense immunohistochemical staining for collagen type II. Gene transfer and IGF- 1 release kinetics from infected cells in monolayer were significantly affected by the composition of the expansion medium, the gene transfer method and time. IGF- 1 gene transfer in CG scaffolds resulted in a 35 -fold elevation in accumulated IGF- 1 released from transfected Medium 2 -expanded chondrocytes over controls, and resulted in a 40 % increase in accumulated GAG/DNA. ConclusionThe composition of the expansion medium significantly affects monolayer proliferation of adult canine chondrocytes, GAG synthesis when the cells are subsequently grown in CG scaffolds, and ex vivo IGF- 1 gene transfer...|$|E

40|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} (SCI) {{are one of}} {{the most}} complex injuries to treat in the medical area. Due to the complexity of the spinal cord, the treatments are mostly palliative, used to prevent the progression of the injury, handle spasticity, deafferentation pain syndromes and dysautonomia 1. Herein, we propose a cell-based approach, taking benefit of particular characteristics of adipose derived stem/stromal cells (hASC). When compared to other stem cell sources, hASC present key advantages such as their immuno-modulatory properties, low immunogenicity, high cell yield per gram of processed tissue, and, their neural differentiation potential, which have been described 2. In this project, we aimed to explore and validate procedures to differentiate hASC into cells of the neural lineage, through the use of xeno-free and therapeutic grade reagents along the entire cell manufacturing process. Human ASC (hASC xeno-free, irisbiosciences, Portugal) were cultured in xeno-free media as control, or in neural induction media (Cell Therapy Systems, Life Technologies). Three culturing phases were tested: i) Expansion, for cell proliferation up to p 2 - 3; ii) Pre-Induction, where cells were stimulated with 20 ng/mL bFGF and 20 ng/mL EGF and iii) Differentiation, where cells were cultured 10 days, triggered by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 10 ng/mL). Additionally, cells were cultured in presence or absence of poly-l-lysin/laminin coated surfaces. After pre-induction and differentiation phases, gene expression of neural markers were determined by qRT-PCR: bIII tubulin and neurofilament (NEFL) for early and mature neural differentiation, respectively; myelin basic protein (MBP) as an oligodendrocytic marker, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as astrocytic marker. When compared to <b>expansion</b> <b>media,</b> cells cultured in neural induction media proliferated less, and formed so-called neuro-spheres in non-adherent plates. Yet, cells that remained in monolayer, demonstrated higher gene expression of neural markers. This was also observed for cells cultured in coated surfaces. At end of culture, NEFL was the mostly expressed marker, followed by MBP (Fig. 1) With the developed procedure, yet to be validated, high up-regulation of neural lineage genes were determined after differentiation, relatively to non-differentiation control: 10 - 40 x of βIII tubulin neuron marker; 60 - 540 x of NEFL neuron marker and 7 - 295 x of MBP oligo-dendrocyte marker. No GFAP expression was detected suggesting that the conditions tested do not promote establishment of astrocytic cells. This data suggest that the tested protocol might become suitable for production of cells useful for SCI repair therapies...|$|E

In a previous study, we showed that mouse bone marrow-derived SCs (BM-SCs) differentiated into neuronal cell-like lineages when put in a neuronal-like environment, which is a special media supplemented with the necessary growth factors needed for the differentiation of SCs into neuronal cell-like lineages. Aim: In this study, we aim to assess the potentials of adult human CD 34 + and CD 133 + SCs to differentiate into neuronal cell-like lineages ex vivo when placed in a neuronal-like microenvironment. Methods: The neuronal-like microenvironment was created by culturing cells in nonhematopoietic <b>expansion</b> <b>media</b> (NHEM) supplemented with growth factors that favor differentiation into neuronal cell lineages (low-affinity nerve growth factor [LNGF], mouse spinal cord extract [mSpE], or both). Cultured cells were assessed for neuronal differentiation by cell morphologies and by expression of GFAP. Results: Our results show that culturing unpurified human BM-derived mononuclear cells (hBM-MNCs) in NHEM+LNGF+mSpE did not lead to neuronal differentiation. In contrast, culturing of purified CD 34 + hBM-SCs in NHEM+LNGF+mSpE favored their differentiation into astrocyte-like cells, whereas culturing of purified CD 133 + hBM-SCs in the same media favored their differentiation into neuronal-like cells. Interestingly, coculturing of CD 34 + and CD 133 + hBM-SCs in the same media enhanced the differentiation into astrocyte-like cells and neuronal-like cells, in addition to oligodendrocyte-like cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that a mixture of purified CD 34 + and CD 133 + cells may enhance the differentiation into neuronal cell-like lineages and give broader neuronal cell lineages than when each of these cell types is cultured alone. This method opens the window for the utilization of specific populations of hBM-SCs to be delivered in a purified form for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the future.
