"I {{have only}} one or two {{questions}} to ask you," [...] the counsel for the defence said, when he rose to cross-examine, [...] "for indeed your evidence is, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> will agree, altogether in favour of the prisoner.

"My {{opponent}} {{has done}} his utmost, even overstepping limits, {{to prove that}} the witness Lorimer has ended a long course of injury by supporting a false charge against the prisoner Fletcher. This is after all a side issue, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> will agree that he has furnished most reliable testimony, and that the prisoner mentioned took an unprincipled advantage of his perfectly well-intentioned kindness." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paulissen {{started his}} 2008 season by {{defending}} the men's cross-country race title at the Belgian Championships and by {{taking part in}} the Roc d'Azur MTB Marathon tournament, where he registered two more triumphs in the process. In July, Paulissen grabbed his first major success in men's marathon race at the UCI World Championships in Villabassa under a more controversial decision. With only 70 meters left to go, Paulissen held off a sprint duel match against Switzerland's Christoph Sauser for a spectacular finish, until they suddenly made contact with their handlebars and arms near the barrier and then both crashed. Being the first man up after hitting the tarmac hard, Paulissen reluctantly carried his broken bike towards the finish, while his rival Sauser remounted his lead to cross the line first, but ended his campaign with a protest. After the race, the UCI officials decided that Sauser was relegated to second place for riding [...] "dangerously" [...] in the sprint and instead Paulissen was declared the World champion with a time of 4:46:56. Following his controversial triumph, Paulissen admitted, [...] "I am very happy with this success. Unfortunately, this great race in the area where I live ended this way, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was right." ...|$|E

Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also <b>the</b> writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R

But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of <b>the</b> theatres. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> President is doing fine. So, all I say is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{interesting}} that some of my predictions came true and some did not, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{is still out on}} many of them. I start to remind everyone on the glorious past of Nephrology, from the physiology, translational and methodological discoveries that have contributed to the development of our discipline. I predict that the Academic branch of Nephrology will continue to excel in three domains: Creative Research,Teaching (Training) and Innovative Clinical Care. I forsee dramatic changes in Nephrology practice in the short term (10 years) and I discuss which areas will have a most dramatic impact. Many developments will likely curtail the growth of CKD and decrease the burden of ESRD on society. The greatest challenge will be to ensure that {{what can be done to}} alleviate suffering and premature death from kidney disease will be done, in a cost-effective manner, and that all patients with kidney disease have reasonable and timely access to care for their illnesses. Nephrologists practicing in the second quarter of the 21 st Century and beyond will be justifiably proud of their discipline, just as their predecessors have...|$|E
