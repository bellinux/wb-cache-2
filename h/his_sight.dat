George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose <b>his</b> <b>sight,</b> and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|At 80years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare's plays because {{cataracts}} {{threatened to}} blind him, but an operation saved <b>his</b> <b>sight.</b> On {{a visit to}} the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by enemy fire during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Randles, {{also known}} as Bessy, was born on 1 August 1800 in Wrexham, north Wales. Her father, Edward Randles, the organist at the Holywell parish church of St. James, lost <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> {{at the age of}} three as a result of small pox. Perhaps due to his lack of sight, his parents placed him to be trained under the blind harpist John Parry, whom he excelled under. Randles was the {{youngest}} of Randles' several children including her brother Edward, who would become a subsequent organist at the parish church.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} years, Larwood withdrew his claims that Bradman had been frightened of him, and {{acknowledged}} his Australian foe {{as the greatest}} batsman of all time. He was gradually losing <b>his</b> <b>sight,</b> although he retained his alertness, and on his 90th birthday was able to join {{in a game of}} garden cricket with his great-grandchildren. He died in hospital on 22 July 1995, following a brief illness, in his 91st year. He was cremated, and his ashes placed in a memorial wall at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Kingsford. A plaque with a simple inscription was placed on the wall by his daughters. His wife Lois died in 2001, and her ashes were placed alongside his.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E

5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost <b>his</b> <b>sight,</b> and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in 1871 by the English philanthropist Thomas Rhodes Armitage and the American anti-slavery campaigner Francis Joseph Campbell, who lost <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London {{would be a more}} suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E
5|$|After Marwan's 732 expedition, {{a period}} of quiet set in. Marwan was {{replaced}} as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns at all until 735, when he lost <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> and resigned. Marwan was then re-appointed to the post, but he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions until 737: three fortresses near the Darial Pass and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, were captured in 735, while another local prince, Wartanis, was defeated and killed in 736. Blankinship attributes this inactivity to the exhaustion of the Arab armies and draws a parallel with the contemporaneous quiet phase in Transoxiana in 732–734, where the Arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats {{at the hands of}} Turkic nomads. In addition, Agapius and Michael the Syrian record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay to a tactical ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering <b>his</b> <b>sight,</b> which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E

5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost <b>his</b> <b>sight,</b> but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E

He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. <b>His</b> <b>sight</b> never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
