40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} done to better understand the effects of taxation on cigarette consumption. Since cigarettes are addictive, it could be expected that taxation would have little or no effect on the number of cigarette smoked per day or the percentage of smokers within a given population. This paper aims to investigate these effects and, more specifically, differentiate be-tween adult smokers and underage smokers. It will be shown that the percent-age of adult smokers does not change with taxation whereas the percentage of underage smokers decreases significantly when excise taxes on cigarettes increase. In addition, it will also be shown that the average number of ciga-rettes smoked per day decreases as well. 1 Serginio Sylvain is a fourth year student the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a dual concentration in Economics and Mathematics.

40|$|The thesis explores {{possible}} reasons {{why people are}} drawn to violent Islamist groups. This is done by mapping psychological mechanisms which might be effective {{in the process of}} making individuals receptive to the jihadi-Salafi ideology. The thesis' perspective stems from the conviction that the structural conditions in a given society are decisive in the propagation of radical oppositional groups. The psychological mechanism known as the sour-grapes syndrome will serve to illustrate the effect of the socio-economic conditions in the Middle East. In Jean de La Fontaine's fable, a fox decides that the grapes <b>he</b> <b>can</b> not <b>reach</b> <b>are</b> sour and thus not worth having.

Carlson, the delay in the Nichols trial verdict does not necessarily suggest that the jury will remain hopelessly deadlocked. Carlson has high praise for Judge Bodiford 2 ̆ 7 s shepherding of the jury through to this point, and he is hopeful the judge 2 ̆ 7 s gentle persuasion will bring about a decision. 2 ̆ 2 If all else fails, the judge will perhaps employ an 2 ̆ 7 Allen 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 dynamite 2 ̆ 7 jury charge, which is an instruction to the jury designed to bring about unanimity and conclude the deliberations. 2 ̆ 2 When the jury asked to hear a recording of Nichols 2 ̆ 7 telephone call wherein Nichols said he should have stopped on the D. A. 2 ̆ 7 s floor {{on the day of}} the killings with his gun in hand, that suggested an attitude of vengeance, not remorse. 2 ̆ 2 The jury 2 ̆ 7 s interest in hearing that recording again may be telling us that juror 2 ̆ 7 s who are in the majority are saying to the other jurors 2 ̆ 7 If we let him go without capital punishment, he might kill again. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 As jury deliberations continue Friday afternoon, Carlson, who has attended portions of the Nichols trial, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> at (706) 548 - 6771 (home). <b>He</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> next week either at home or at (706) 542 - 5186 (law school).

40|$|Access, maintenance, and {{distribution}} of clean water are daunting tasks for developing nations. Efforts to provide clean drinking water have often fallen short, which has prompted the World Bank to advocate for privatization. From a theoretical perspective, privatization blends the advantages of corporate efficiency with responsible management {{on behalf of the}} national government. Analysis of attempts to privatize water in the Philippines, with the establishment of the Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System (MWSS), shows mixed results. Between 1997 and 2003, citizens with access to water increased from 58 percent to 84 percent, yet water became five times costlier due to privatization. Advocates may applaud the efficiency of the model, but developing nations must emphasize accessibility and affordability of the resource. Privatization, as a model for water distribution, remains contentious. * The following authors include MPA candidates at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and a researcher at the Earth Institute.

It shows that Nye’s position is far from multilateralist, still insisting as it does on hard power supremacy {{and the need for}} America to lead. It then argues that the case made is weak, both in theory (because of a misuse of collective action theory) and in practice (because of the evidence he himself provides that America is unable to provide constructive, co-operative leadership). It concludes that the best contribution that America could make to global stability would be to relinquish the claim to leadership, not only in cases where it is at odds with the international community, or widely seen as itself the source of instability, but particularly in cases where shared perspectives regarding common goals and approaches do exist.

To these are added estimates of the Earth’s carrying capacity, the attractiveness principle, and 2007 as our forecast for peak oil. Further, the energy and population history of the U.

S. energy production per capita has gone from growth, through stagnation, and now into terminal decline. The world has gone from growth and now into stagnation.
