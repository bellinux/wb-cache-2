500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney may {{be looking for a}} merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put me to sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. <b>I</b> <b>confess</b> <b>I</b> may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E
500|$|The fictional {{character}} Stingaree {{proved to}} be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series [...] "In the Chains of Crime" [...] was published in June that year, titled [...] "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders [...] "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" [...] (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: [...] "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that [...] "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though <b>I</b> <b>confess</b> <b>I</b> think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that [...] "stern moralists" [...] would consider the book's premise [...] "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer [...] "expressing [...] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue." ...|$|E
