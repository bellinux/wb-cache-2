5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A <b>hangover,</b> {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
