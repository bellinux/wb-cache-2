25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, {{that there is no}} consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E
500|$|On {{the opening}} leg, U2 sold 528,763tickets and grossed US$13,215,414 in 32shows. They grossed US$67million overall in 73 North American shows in 1992, easily the highest amount for any touring artist that year. At the time, {{this was the}} third-highest gross for a North American tour, behind the Rolling Stones' 1989 Steel Wheels Tour and New Kids on the Block's 1990 Magic Summer Tour. For 1992, Zoo TV ticket sales in America and Europe totalled 2.9million. The [...] "Zooropa" [...] stadium leg the {{following}} year played to more than 2.1million people over 43dates between 9 May and 28 August. In total, the Zoo TV Tour played to about 5.3million people. The band incurred heavy expenses to produce the tour, leading to only a small profit. According to McGuinness, [...] "We grossed $30million in T-shirt sales. Without those we'd be fucked." [...] Bono later said, [...] "When we built Zoo TV, we were so close to bankruptcy that if five percent fewer people went, U2 was bankrupt. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> irresponsible, youthful and fatal disregard of such material matters, it was terrifying." ...|$|E

500|$|Pair {{instability}} supernovae {{occur when}} an oxygen core {{in an extremely}} massive star becomes hot enough that gamma rays spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs. [...] This causes the core to collapse, but where the collapse of an iron core causes endothermic fusion to heavier elements, the collapse of an oxygen core creates runaway exothermic fusion which completely unbinds the star. [...] The total energy emitted depends on the initial mass, {{with much of the}} core being converted to 56Ni and ejected which then powers the supernova for many months. [...] At the lower end stars of about [...] produce supernovae that are long-lived but otherwise typical, while the highest mass stars of around [...] produce supernovae that are extremely luminous and also very long lived; hypernovae. [...] More massive stars die by photodisintegration. [...] Only population III stars, with very low metallicity, can reach this stage. [...] Stars with more heavy elements are more opaque and blow away their outer layers until they are small enough to explode as a normal type Ib/c supernova. [...] It is thought that <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own galaxy, mergers of old low metallicity stars may form massive stars capable of creating a pair instability supernova.|$|E

2500|$|Harlow {{also wanted}} to test how {{isolation}} would affect parenting skills, but the isolates were unable to mate. Artificial insemination had not then been developed; instead, Harlow devised {{what he called a}} [...] "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. He found that, just as they were incapable of having sexual relations, they were also unable to parent their offspring, either abusing or neglecting them. [...] "Not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> most devious dreams could we have designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were", he wrote. Having no social experience themselves, they were incapable of appropriate social interaction. One mother held her baby's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers. Another crushed her baby's head. Most of them simply ignored their offspring.|$|E
