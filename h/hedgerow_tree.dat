40|$|Abstract: The {{dearth of}} fertile ‘virgin ’ land and inaccessibility to {{standard}} chemical fertilizers, coupled with low tuber yields has made cassava cultivation unprofitable {{in parts of}} traditional cassava zone of West Africa. Field experiments were conducted at Ajibode and Alabata villages located in Ibadan (derived savanna zone), Nigeria to evaluate cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) root yield response to alley cropping species and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) inoculations. On farm trials were conducted during two growing seasons, in Rhodic Kandiustalf soil type with low nutrients. The alley cropping systems used Leuceana leucocephala and Senna siamea as <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> species (main blocks), while AMF inoculation (with or without Glomus clarum, G. mosseae, or G. fasciculatum) served as the subplots. Improved cassava cvs. TMS 30572 and TMS 91934 were intercropped within alleys. The leaf dry weight and cassava tuber yield were greatly enhanced by AMF inoculation, whether alley-cropped or sole-cropped in Ajibode fields. The positive contribution of mycorrhizae to cassava root yield ranged from 20. 7 to 39. 3 %, depending on the treatment combination. However, in Alabata fields, out of four farms, cassava yield was suppressed {{in three of the}} farms by hedgerow trees. The suppression in yield was between 138. 9 and 2. 7 %. However, the combination of the multipurpose trees and AM fungi greatly enhanced the cassava root yield (between 20. 6 and 166. 7 %) even more than AMF inoculation alone. It is concluded that alley cropping system can bring about sustainable cassava production in the derived savanna agroecological zone if integrated gith efficient AMF. Due to favourable factors it is desirable to encourage adoption of the above improved technologies by resource poor farmers.

40|$|Hedgerows {{represent}} important {{components of}} agri-environment landscapes that are increasingly coming under threat from climate change, emergent diseases, invasive species and land-use change. Given that population genetic {{data can be}} used to inform best-practice management strategies for woodland and <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> species, we carried out a study on hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.), a key component of hedgerows, on a regional basis using a combination of nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers. We found that levels of genetic diversity were high and comparable to, or slightly higher than, other tree species from the same region. Levels of population differentiation for both sets of markers, however, were extremely low, suggesting extensive gene flow via both seed and pollen. These findings suggest that a holistic approach to woodland management, one which does not necessarily rely on the concept of ?seed zones? previously suggested, but which also takes into account populations with high and/or rare chloroplast (i. e. seed-specific) genetic variation, might be the best approach to restocking and replanting. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{effectiveness}} of agri-environment schemes is essential for reversing declines in farmland biodiversity. Crucial to achieving this is identifying management options that are practical and beneficial to biodiversity, and understanding {{the influence of the}} surrounding landscape. We used data on abundance and species richness of farmland macro-moths, many of which are declining, and trait-based analyses on their feeding guild, mobility and conservation status, to explore local- and landscape-scale effects of two farmland features (extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees) and surrounding farmland intensification. Macro-moths were light trapped at 48 fixed sites on 16 farms, over 4 years, within a 1200 -km 2 area of lowland UK farmland. Sites belonged to one of four experimental groups that differed in their combinations of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> presence and field margin width. Hedgerow trees and extended-width field margins locally increased species richness, but not abundance, of macro-moths, irrespective of each other's presence. Overall, species richness and abundance were not affected by agricultural intensification, as measured by the amount of arable land in the surrounding landscape. Sedentary moths showed double the species richness, but were half as abundant as mobile moths. Both groups responded positively to extended-width margin and <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> presence. The effect of hedgerow trees was particularly strong for shrub- and/or tree-feeding species. Analyses based on the conservation status of moths demonstrated that agricultural intensification lowered the species richness of nationally severely declining UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species and the abundance of both nationally moderately declining and priority species. These effects were most pronounced at the 0 · 8 -km radius scale. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the presence of extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees, possibly promoted by agri-environment schemes targeting their implementation at relatively small spatial scales (0 · 8 km), may help mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on macro-moths. A wide range of other taxa feed on macro-moths and may therefore indirectly benefit from these features. Nevertheless, taxa differ widely in their mobility and measures mitigating biodiversity loss may need to be targeted at multiple spatial scales to maximize their effectiveness for multiple taxa.

Accurate quantifications depend on accurate determination of the mass, percentage N, and percentage 15 N enrichment of each pool and past studies have mainly used physically isolated subplots to reduce variability. We thus assessed the within-plot and within-plant variability of 15 N recovery by maize and by two <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> species, Gliricidia sepium and Peltophorum dasyrrachis, following applications of 15 N-enriched materials to unbounded plots. We also assessed the potential for estimating total plant 15 N recovery from a reduced set of samples, and for estimating N content allometrically from simple measurements. 15 N uptake beyond 1 m radius was negligible in maize but recommended minimum inter-plot spacing for Gliricidia sepium and Peltophorum dasyrrachis was 8 m. Within-plant variation was also greater in trees than in maize. Calculating recovery from all crop plant components is not always necessary; the recovery of 15 N in maize grain predicted 98. 9 ␘f variation in total plant 15 N recovery. 89 – 95 ccurate estimates of biomass and N content of maize plants and of regrowing tree shoots can be obtained non-destructively from height or basal shoot diameter respectively. 15 N tracing techniques are potentially very useful for studies of competition and complementarity with respect to nitrogen uptake in agroforestry systems but they require unbounded plots and hence particular care in design and sampling procedures...|$|E

In a long-term field trial in Scheyern Germany, we evaluated {{the effects of}} 21 -year organic farming and 4 -year agroforestry (robinia and poplar) on microbial community and microbial residues. Microbial biomass and microbial community were determined by fumigation–extraction method and the analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), respectively. Microbial residues were evaluated by the measurement of amino sugars. The results showed that organic farming had significantly positive effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) but that it tended to decrease microbial biomass C (MBC), PLFA functional guilds, muramic acid (MurN), and glucosamine (GlcN). Robinia system, however, significantly increased SOC and {{had the potential to}} enhance MBC, PLFA functional guilds especially Gram (?), but it tended to decrease MurN and GlcN, in comparison with poplar system. The <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> did not show significantly positive effect on SOC and microbial properties except the abundance of fungi and Gram (?) bacterial, after 4 -year establishment period. The principal component analysis of the PLFA profile showed that in comparison with other investigated treatments, robinia system under organic farming had significantly a different microbial community structure. It also indicated tree species-specific effect on microbial community in the organic farming was stronger than that in the integrated farming. In summary, the short-term introduction of trees into an existing agricultural system will not substantially change the microbial biomass, but it has certain influence on the abundance of specific microbial groups in the hedgerow. Although organic farming did not show positive effect on overall microbial indices, we still see positive effect on SOC after 21 -year organic farming and its additive effect with robinia on SOC in current study. We expect that alley-cropping agroforestry system that combines organic farming and robinia hedgerow has a great potential for sequestering SOC and developing sustainable agroecosystems with time...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify components of the water balance related to root-water uptake in the soil below a hedgerow. At this local scale, a two-dimensional (2 D) flow domain in the x-z plane 6 m long and 1 * 55 m deep was considered. An attempt was made to estimate transpiration using a simulation model. The SWMS- 2 D model was modified and used to simulate temporally and spatially heterogeneous boundary conditions. A function with a variable spatial distribution of root-water uptake was considered, and model calibration was performed by adjusting this root-water uptake distribution. Observed data from a previous field study were compared against model predictions. During the validation step, satisfactory agreement was obtained, as the difference between observed and modelled pressure head values was less than 50 cm for 80 % of the study data. Hedge transpiration capacity is a significant component of soil-water balance in the summer, when predicted transpiration reaches about 5 * 6 mm day− 1. One of the most important findings is that hedge transpiration is nearly twice that of a forest canopy. In addition, soil-water content is significantly different whether downslope or upslope depending on the root-water uptake. The high transpiration rate was mainly due to the presence of a shallow water table below the hedgerow trees. Soil-water content was not a limiting factor for transpiration in this context, as it could be in one with a much deeper water table. <b>Hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> transpiration exerts a strong impact not only on water content within the vadose zone but also on the water-table profile along the transect.

40|$|Objective of Research The {{interest}} in crop modelling started since the introduction and popularisation of computer technology, which facilitated the dynamic simulation of complex natural systems. In particular, crop growth and soil water balance models for irrigation scheduling are popular at locations where {{water is a}} limiting factor for crop production. In a Water Research Commission project, the soil water balance model (SWB) for irrigation scheduling under full and deficit irrigation was made available. The SWB model is a relatively simple generic crop growth model based on sound physical and physiological principles, (i. e. mechanistic) using daily climatic inputs for daily time-step calculations of the soil-plant-atmosphere water balance to estimate plant growth water use. The SWB model was primarily developed for predicting real-time soil water deficit of field crops with a one-dimensional canopy light interception and water redistribution procedure. <b>Hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> crops are planted in widely spaced rows to allow access between trees to carry out necessary management practices (e. g. pest control and harvesting). Distribution of energy is not uniform in widely spaced crops. In addition, localised under tree irrigation is often used for tree crops to reduce system installation costs. This irrigation (micro- or drip) only wets a limited area under the canopy of the trees so that evaporation from the soil surface is also not uniform. One can expect root density to vary with depth {{as well as with}} distance between the rows so water uptake for transpiration will also vary in two dimensions. It is also essential {{to take into account the}} limited volume of soil wetted under micro-irrigation. If this is not done, the soil capacity will be incorrectly estimated with a standard one-dimensional approach, leading to undesirable over-irrigation in the wetted zone, as well as possible crop stress resulting from a too long an irrigation interval. In order to accurately estimate canopy growth, water balance and yield, it is therefore essential to model canopy radiant interception and soil water balance of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> crops in two dimensions and on an hourly time step, based on sound physical principles. Lack of suitable user-friendly tools to mechanistically describe the two-dimensional energy and soil water balance of tree crops was identified. Due to the importance of fruit crops, on the export as well as local markets, as well as the encouraging results from the initial SWB model, it was decided to improve the SWB model by incorporating a two-dimensional system for use in hedgerow plantings. This thesis reports on the methodology developed to monitor the energy and soil moisture differences within various hedgerows through 24 hour cycles and the results obtained, as well as the subsequent use of the results to evaluate the 2 -dimensional water balance model. This research was an integral, but independent, part of a larger research thrust, i. e. the development of a two-dimensional fruit tree water balance model that can account for the unique fractional interception of solar radiation associated with hedgerow orchards as opposed to the horizontal planar interception encountered in agronomic crops. The primary objective of this thesis is not the actual programming and mathematical manipulations of the relevant algorithms but to create a reliable data base and then evaluate the model. The primary objective of this thesis was to evaluate the model for deciduous fruit trees using peaches as an example and evaluate the model for evergreen fruit trees using citrus as an example. Model description In the overall research thrust two types of model, both predicting crop water requirements on a daily time step, were developed for <b>hedgerow</b> <b>tree</b> crops and included in SWB: i) A mechanistic two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference, Richards’ equation based soil water balance model; and ii) An FAO-based crop factor model, with a quasi- 2 D cascading soil water balance model. For the sake of clarity and completeness, the principles of the models are presented in the thesis and are briefly described in this subsection. The first model calculates the two-dimensional energy interception for hedgerow fruit trees, based on solar and row orientation, tree size and shape, as well as leaf area density. The two-dimensional soil water redistribution is calculated with a finite difference solution. The two-dimensional energy interception model assumes leaves to be uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid truncated at its base, and radiation penetrating the canopy is attenuated according to Beer’s law. This geometry is very versatile as many different shapes can be generated. In order to determine the spatial distribution of soil irradiance across the tree row, the canopy path length through which the radiation must travel to reach a certain point on the soil surface is calculated. Radiation can penetrate neighbouring rows, so two rows on either side of the simulated row are considered. Beam or direct radiation and diffuse radiation for the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and NIR (near-infrared radiation) wavebands are calculated separately, as they interact differently with the canopy. The ratio of actual measured to potential radiation is used to estimate the proportion of direct and diffuse radiation in these two spectral bands. The attenuation of beam radiation by the canopy is strongly dependent on zenith angle, and, for crops planted in rows, azimuth angle and row orientation will also be crucial. Elevation and azimuth angles are calculated from latitude, solar declination that depends on day of year, and time of day. Before the length of canopy through which radiation penetrates can be calculated, azimuth angle needs to be adjusted to take row orientation into account. Input data required to run the two-dimensional canopy interception model are: day of year (DOY), latitude, standard meridian, longitude, daily solar radiation, row width and orientation, canopy height and width, bare stem height and distance from the ground to the bottom of the canopy, extinction coefficient, absorptivity and leaf area density. In order to simulate two-dimensional water movement in the soil, a grid of nodes were established. This divides the soil up into a number of elements. The distances between nodes are selected so that model output can easily be compared to field measured values. Each element has its own physical properties, so this scheme allows variation in soil properties in two dimensions. Symmetry planes are assumed to occur mid-way between two rows on either side of the hedgerow and no water flux is allowed across these planes. The model redistributes water in the soil in two-dimensions using a finite difference solution to Richards’ continuity equation for water flow. The aim is to find the matric potentials, which will cause the mass balance error to be negligible. This is done using the Newton-Raphson procedure. Two lower boundary conditions can be chosen in the model: i) gravity drainage for well-drained soils, and ii) zero-flux lower boundary to simulate an impermeable layer. A precipitation or irrigation in mm is converted to a flux in kg m- 1 s- 1 by dividing the time step and multiplying by the horizontal distance over which the water is distributed. The infiltration does not have to be uniform over the surface. Non-uniform infiltration is especially important in very coarse soils where lateral redistribution is likely to be limited, or in the case of micro-irrigation. As with the infiltration flux, evaporation is multiplied by the horizontal distance over which it occurs in order to get an evaporative flux in kg m- 1 s- 1. Potential vapotranspiration (PET) is calculated from weather data using the Penman-Monteith equation and the maximum crop factor after rainfall occurs. PET is then partitioned at the soil surface into potential evaporation and potential transpiration depending on solar orientation, row direction and canopy size, shape and leaf area density. Crop water uptake (transpiration) can either be limited by atmospheric demand or soil-root water supply. Root densities at different soil depths are accounted for in the calculation of root water uptake. The user can specify root depth and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil. Required inputs for the two-dimensional soil water balance model are: starting and planting dates, altitude, rainfall and irrigation water amounts, as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature. Two points on the water retention function (usually field capacity and permanent wilting point), initial volumetric soil water content and bulk density are required for each soil layer. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity can also be entered as input for each soil layer, or calculated by the model using the water retention curve. Row distance, wetted diameter of micro-jets or drippers, fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil as well as distance of the nodes from the tree row are also required as input. The second, simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach, was developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with limited input data. This model includes a semi-empirical approach for partitioning of aboveground energy, a cascading soil water redistribution that separates the wetted and non-wetted portion of the ground, as well as prediction of crop yields. The FAO-based crop factor procedure was combined with the mechanistic SWB model, thereby still allowing evaporation and transpiration to be modelled separately as supply and demand limited processes. The crop factor model does not grow the canopy mechanistically and therefore the effect of water stress on canopy size is not simulated. The simpler crop factor model should, however, still perform satisfactorily if the estimated canopy cover closely resembles that found in the field. The following input parameters are required to run the FAO-type crop factor model: planting date, latitude, altitude, maximum and minimum daily air temperatures, FAO crop factors and duration of crop stages. The input data required to run the two-dimensional cascading model are rainfall and irrigation amounts, volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point, as well as initial volumetric soil water content for each soil layer. Row spacing, wetted diameter, distance between micro-irrigators or drippers and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil are also required. Required input data for yield prediction with the FAO model are FAO stress factors for growing stages and potential yield. Field Trial Evaluation of the model was carried out for a wide range of conditions (row orientation, period of the year and canopy density). For this purpose, two field trials were set up. The first trial was established in a peach (Prunus persica cv Transvaalia) orchard on the lysimeter facilities at Hatfield (Pretoria University experimental farm). This provided a site where detailed observations could be easily recorded to evaluate the SWB model for deciduous trees. The second trial was established in a citrus clementine (Citrus reticulate cv. Nules Clementine) orchard at the Syferkuil experimental farm of the University of the North. This was the site where measured data were collected to evaluate the SWB model for evergreen trees. In both field trials, the following field measurements were carried out and used to evaluate the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model: i) Weather measurements (temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall). ii) Soil texture, bulk density, penetrometer resistance. iii) Volumetric soil water content with neutron water meter and time domain reflectometry (TDR). iv) Soil matrix potential with heat dissipation sensors. v) Root distribution by taking soil core samples and washing out roots to determine root length. vi) Soil irradiance at different distances from the tree row with tube solarimeters. v) Leaf area index and density with a LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyser. vi) Canopy size and row orientation. In addition, load cell lysimeters were used in the peach orchard at Hatfield in order to measure crop water use. An additional field trial was carried out at the Hatfield experimental station on Leuceaena (Leucaena leucocephela) trees in order to test the two-dimensional radiant interception model for different environmental conditions (tree size and shape as well as row orientation). For the same purpose, two other trials were carried out on two commercial orchards at Brits in Empress Mandarin (Citrus reticulate cv. Empress) and Delta Valencia (Citrus sinensis [L. ] cv. Osbeck) orchards. In these field trials, weather data were recorded, soil irradiance across the row was measured with tube solarimeters, as well as leaf area index and density, canopy size and row orientation. Results The simple, quasi two-dimensional, cascading soil water balance model was calibrated using data from the peach trial at the Hatfield experimental station. In the process, FAO basal crop coefficients (Kcb) were determined for first and second leaf peach trees. The daily crop factor (Kc) was calculated using evapotranspiration measurements from the lysimeters and the grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from weather data. The Kcb values for the various growth stages were determined by fitting an appropriate line through the lower values of Kc, which were taken to reflect the condition where the soil surface was dry (negligible evaporation), subsoil drainage was negligible and there was sufficient water not to restrict transpiration. There was good agreement between predicted and measured daily soil water deficit for water stressed and non-stressed treatments. This was expected since the calibration data came from the trial. Field measurements in Hatfield also indicated that in hedgerow plantings the whole area across the row must be borne in mind when assessing soil water content. The practice of using single or restricted locality measurements, as utilised in agronomic crops, can be misleading in orchards. The reason for this is the effect of the irrigation distribution and rain interception by the canopy, the variation in radiation interception by the canopy across the row, the irradiance reaching the soil surface as the season progresses, the presence of a grass sod or bare soil in the inter-row region and the root density across the row. In both field trials at Hatfield and Syferkuil, it was found that there are significant amounts of roots in the inter-row region and thus this portion of the rooting volume must not be disregarded when assessing the water balance. The two-dimensional energy interception and soil evaporation components were evaluated separately. The crucial interactions between the model components were integrated in the validation of the two-dimensional soil water balance model, which uses the energy interception and soil evaporation sub-models to split evaporation and transpiration. The radiant interception model predictions and the tube solarimeter measured soil irradiance generally gave very good agreement at different distances from the tree row and in different orchards. However, some discrepancies between measurements and model predictions occurred. This was attributed to the presence of trunks and branches shading the tube solarimeters at low leaf area densities, irregularities in the shape of the hedgerow, and nonuniform distribution of leaves within the canopy. In one case the canopy shape differed drastically from that used in the model. The output obtained with the two-dimensional soil water balance model was compared to independent field measurements in order to evaluate the full SWB two-dimensional model. Volumetric soil water content data collected with the TDR system in the peach and citrus orchards were compared to SWB simulations. Results of model simulations done during drying cycles showed that the surface layer predictions were generally very good. However, in certain situations discrepancies between measurements and simulations were observed, in particular, for deeper soil layers. This could have been due to spatial variability of soil properties, as well as soil disturbance during the installation of TDR probes. It is clear that TDR probes can be used in irrigation scheduling to determine crop water use over certain periods. Caution should, however, be exercised in the interpretation of absolute values of volumetric soil water content obtained from the probes. Scenario modelling and sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying some input parameters and observing variations in certain output variables. The aim was to show an application of this tool to identify the most suitable management practice in order to maximise water use efficiency. Two case studies were considered for two “virtual” orchards located at different latitudes and in different climates (Kakamas in the Northern Cape and Stellenbosch in the Western Cape). The results of the scenario simulations indicated that, based on the inputs used, the orchards should be planted in a N-S row orientation, a wetted diameter of 0. 5 m should be applied when the canopy width is 2 m, in order to minimize water losses through evaporation. As the canopy width increased to 3 m, so the wetted diameter should be increased to 1. 5 m. If the wetted diameter is too small, transpiration and thus yield will be reduced. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for both case studies varying the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil, and observing variations in the output results of evaporation and transpiration. The contribution to crop water uptake from the inter-row volume of soil can be high, in particular under high atmospheric evaporative demand, and this needs to be accounted for in irrigation management in order to maximise rainfall use efficiency in areas of higher summer rainfall. Conclusions and recommendations The methodologies developed to measure the temporal and spatial variation in solar radiation and thus the energy distribution within Hedgerow orchards worked well. The methods used to measure the temporal and spatial variation of the soil water balance also worked well. Thus a very good data set was generated that enabled the sound evaluation of the 2 -D SWB model. Thus one can conclude that the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model that was developed in the overall research thrust and included in the Soil Water Balance irrigation scheduling model worked well. The simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach and a cascading soil water balance, that was also developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with a limited set of input data, also gave very satisfactory results. The FAO-based model and the cascading soil water balance were calibrated for first leaf and second leaf peaches at Hatfield. The two-dimensional model was fully evaluated for deciduous orchards using data obtained in field trials on peaches and Leucaena (Hatfield). For model validation in evergreen citrus orchards, data obtained in field trials set up at the Syferkuil experimental station (University of the North) and on two commercial farms in Brits were used. Irregular trunks and branches could cause inaccuracies in predictions of the energy balance. At low leaf area densities, the shade from trunks and branches is not accounted for in the SWB model. The relative importance of non-symmetric canopy shape as opposed to nonuniform leaf distribution did have an effect but indications where that this was not critical. The major difficulties encountered in the evaluation of the soil water balance were due to spatial variability of soil properties and disturbance of the soil when the water status monitoring sensors were installed. Careful installation is therefore recommended when using sensors that give localised measurements like those used in this study (heat dissipation sensors and TDR probes). The successful evaluation of the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model opens the opportunity to develop a useful yield predictor and productivity efficiency measure if one knows the canopy to fruit ratio. This information could also be useful for fruit colour and internal quality research. As demonstrated with data from the peach trial at Hatfield, soil or cover crops between rows can also have a large effect on the efficient use of rainfall, and this could be further investigated. The biggest contribution of this model is likely to be the quantification of the contribution that rainfall can make to crop water use by taking the non-irrigated inter-row soil reservoir into account. It is recommended to accurately estimate the root fraction in the wetted and nonwetted volume of soil by digging a trench across the row, taking core soil samples and determining root densities. The two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference soil water balance model is expected to be more accurate than the cascading soil water balance, due to the sound physical principles on which it is based. The mechanistic detailed approach could give guidance with respect to the magnitude of errors made by using simpler, more empirical approaches. However, the two-dimensional model will also require more input parameters compared to the simpler cascading model. In particular, the most difficult parameters to determine will be the leaf area density for the radiation energy interception part due to the cost of the instrumentation, and the hydraulic conductivity for the soil part due to the specialised knowledge and scientific equipm...|$|E

40|$|Within {{agricultural}} landscapes, linear {{features such}} as hedgerows and tree-lines provide valuable habitat for many species. We use data from 315 transects, completed {{as part of a}} national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to <b>hedgerow</b> width, <b>tree</b> density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either <b>hedgerows</b> without <b>trees,</b> <b>hedgerows</b> with sparse <b>trees</b> (comprising 50 % tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes...|$|R
50|$|The theory behind {{laying a}} hedge is easy. The {{practice}} is much harder, requiring skill and experience. The {{aim is to}} reduce the thickness of the upright stems of the <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> by cutting away the wood {{on one side of the}} stem and in line with the course of the hedge. This being done, each remaining stem is laid down towards the horizontal, along the length of the hedge.|$|R

50|$|A {{quarter of}} Devon's hedges are now {{thought to be}} over 800 years old. They were {{primarily}} constructed {{for the purposes of}} agriculture: as an effective livestock-proof barrier; to provide shelter against the wind for livestock and crops; to control soil erosion and surface runoff; and to act as a habitat, together with uncultivated field-edges, for beneficial insects that prey on crop pests. Historically, the hedges and <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> were also a useful source of timber and wood, and their foliage was eaten by the enclosed livestock.|$|R
50|$|Devon's hedges are a {{particularly}} important wildlife habitat. Around 20% of the UK's species-rich hedges occur within Devon. Over 600 flowering plants, 1500 insects, 65 birds and 20 mammals {{have been recorded}} living or feeding in Devon hedges. At {{the end of the}} 20th century it was reported that many of the <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> in Devon hedges were close to the end of their lives; many of them were planted {{towards the end of the}} 19th century and their life-expectancy is not likely to exceed 150 years.|$|R
5000|$|The area of Ram Hill and Henfield {{comprises}} {{a largely}} strong, irregular rural framework with areas of woodland, mixed overgrown/clipped hedgerows supplemented with wire fences, defining regular shaped fields. The clustered settlement pattern and non-agricultural {{activities such as}} storage compounds, are reasonably well integrated {{as a result of}} this framework. Horse paddocks are however locally evident where hedgerows have become replaced with fences. Associated ad hoc home-made stables are also evident and atypical of a rural landscape. Large modern agricultural sheds are prominent within older farm complexes within this area.The small scale settlement at Ram Hill and Henfield is largely well integrated within the framework of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> and woodland. The area has a generally tranquil character, although the presence of stables and fences associated with the increase in land use change to [...] "horsiculture". modern large farm buildings and storage compounds, can detract from this, visually eroding the rural character and resulting in removal or fragmentation of hedgerows. In places the recreational pressure for [...] "horsiculture" [...] with the associated infrastructure of stables, access tracks, exercise areas, jumps and floodlighting. can result in a marked change in landscape character.Frome Valley - The Study indicates that the Kendleshire Golf Course retains most of the former agricultural <b>hedgerows</b> and <b>tree</b> structure amongst fairways and greens. However the Golf Course introduces a different landscape structure compared with the adjacent agricultural landscape. A more open landscape structure of mown fairways, low mounding, remnant <b>hedgerows</b> and <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> and young planting is evident. The new planting measures will in time provide a new landscape structure and help integrate this land-use change with its surroundings.|$|R

5000|$|Killas is {{a mining}} term {{that refers to}} the {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Devon and Cornwall region. The Cornish Killas forms {{the main body of}} the Cornish landmass around the high granite moorlands such as Bodmin Moor and Hensbarrow. Much of central Cornwall is a gently undulating, slate plateau with little woodland and few <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees,</b> dissected by a complex pattern of valleys. In places there is little woody vegetation apart from scrub-covered stone hedges dominating the farmland. By contrast, the coastline is richly varied, with rugged, windswept cliffs separating broad, sandy bays.|$|R
40|$|Changing climatic {{conditions}} makes {{the development of}} cultivation strategies for protected cherry cultivation necessary. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate physiological processes in connection with light availability in different planting systems under cover using a Dualex™ for non-destructive measurements. Hence, cherry trees were either trained as hedgerows, i. e. the most dense planting ([2. 35 m* 2]* 1. 5 m), or trained as spindles (2. 70 m* 2. 0 m; 1. 75 m* 2. 9 m) and grown under cover or in the open field at Klein-Altendorf near Bonn, Germany. There was no difference in leaf area between the plantings. Non-invasive measurements with the Dualex™ (Force A, France) showed that a larger relative leaf chlorophyll content (Chl = 30 – 33) in the <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> under crop cover as a result of less light than in the open field-grown leaves with less chlorophyll (ChI = 26 – 28). Similarly, the flavonoid index (Flav), as a relative measure of the epidermal flavonoids and light condition, was generally lower under crop cover and lowest in the <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> on the adaxial leaf side with Flav = 1. 4 – 1. 5 relative to 1. 6 – 1. 8 in the open field, but always maintained these high values above the critical light level of 1 – 1. 2. Non-invasive SunScan measurements showed light reductions of up to 80 % inside the canopy of the dense <b>hedgerow</b> <b>trees</b> under cover in line with the lowest values for Flav and ChI. Although the largest yield per tree was obtained in the planting system with the best light conditions (1. 75 m* 2. 9 m), the largest yield per acreage was found in the most dense planting (2. 7 m* 2. 0 m) with hedgerows under cover as an ideal combination of a high yield and fruit quality with good light availability. Overall, our results showed that light availability depends on crown structure, planting system and tree density. The indices Flav and ChI offer the possibility to evaluate the light conditions in an orchard easily and to give a recommendation for an optimized growing system...|$|R
