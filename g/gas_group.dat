2500|$|The {{bankruptcy}} was a novel one. [...] Dynegy had structured itself so that Dynegy Inc. (the holding company) {{had little}} debt. [...] Nearly all the debt {{was held by}} its subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings, which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions. Dynegy Inc. created three operating divisions: [...] the natural <b>gas</b> <b>group</b> (GasCo), the coal group (CoalCo), and a group for all other businesses (known as [...] "the stub group"). GasCo and CoalCo were structured {{so that they would}} be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either Dynegy Inc. or Dynegy Holdings. Part of the structure meant that few of the natural GasCo's and CoalCo's dividends were given to Dynegy Holdings. To separate Dynegy Holdings from Dynegy Inc., Dynegy Holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company (LLC). This legal maneuver took advantage of a Delaware Supreme Court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an LLC's board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty. Finally, GasCo and CoalCo sold themselves to Dynegy Inc., which left Dynegy Holdings holding US$1.25 billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of GasCo and CoalCo {{in the event of a}} default. [...] Under the structure adopted by Dynegy Inc., the company could meet its debt obligations to Dynegy Holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt. This provided an incentive for Dynegy Inc. to withhold payment and force Dynegy Holdings to declare bankruptcy (thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off).|$|E

40|$|Investigations of {{molecular}} and carbon isotopic variability of hydrocarbon gases from methane through butanes (pentanes) {{have been performed}} on six mud volcanoes from two fluid venting provinces located in the Gulf of Cadiz, NE Atlantic. The main aims were to define the basic gas types, to describe their geochemical characteristics in relationship to their sources, and to determine the secondary effects due to migration/mixing and microbial alteration. Hydrocarbon gas data reveal two <b>groups</b> of <b>gases.</b> Despite the different maturation characteristics, both <b>gas</b> <b>groups</b> are allochthonous to the erupted mud breccia and represent a complex of redeposited, secondary migrated, mixed, and microbially altered hydrocarbons. It may possibly imply the presence of hydrocarbon accumulations in the deep subsurface of the Gulf of Cadiz. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
