40|$|A {{key issue}} with various fire {{suppression}} methodologies involves building {{an understanding of}} how the extinguishing agent is delivered in order to extinguish a fire quickly and efficiently. This is particularly applicable to the water mist technologies becoming more prevalent today. Modeling of spray fields and spray transport has long been considered an important area for this field of study. However, a simulation can only be as meaningful as the quality of the initial assumptions and parameters used to drive the model. Empirical suppression studies also benefit from a better understanding of all the variables involved in a test. It is with this motivation in mind that the authors feel a more complete basic characterization of spray styles typically used in water mist fire suppression technologies will be useful to this field of study. For this initial study, several typical hydraulic atomizers used in fire suppression have been fully characterized. The nozzles tested include: a high-pressure misting cluster, a hollow cone misting nozzle, a small capacity full cone pattern nozzle and a <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> <b>pattern</b> “spiral ” nozzle. For the purposes of this investigation, spray angle, flow rate and volume flux distribution were measured. In addition, drop size statistics will also be presented along with the associated drop size distribution for each of the nozzles investigated...|$|E

The {{study has been}} performed at different liquid temperature and pressure to estimate their effects on the spray characteristics. A Mie Scattering optical set-up, employing a laser light sheet and a charge coupled device (CCD) camera, is used to capture the spray images from which the spray cone angles have been evaluated. The liquid distribution from the spray is measured by a mechanical patternator placed at a definite distance below the atomizer. It is observed from the study that, flow number (FN) remains unchanged with {{the change in the}} flow rate for both the <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> and twin fluid atomizers. In case of <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> atomizer, FN increases slightly with the increase in oil temperature thereby consuming less power for delivering the fuel. This phenomenon has not been observed in case of twin fluid atomizer. For pressure atomizers the spray cone angle increases with the increase in the flow rate {{as well as with the}} increase in oil temperature. The cone angle of twin fluid atomizer exhibits almost a constant value for the entire operating range of liquid flow rate, but increases with the increase in both air pressure and oil temperature.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the spray deposition on leaves of coffee plants and the chemical control of the leaf miner provided by the application of different spray nozzles, with and without the use of an auxiliary boom. The deposition on the upper, middle and lower parts of the plants and the losses to the soil were evaluated using a tracer quantified by spectrophotometer. We also evaluated the chemical control of the leaf miner, counting the larvae, after the application of the insecticides cartap and fenpropathrin. The trial was carried out in a randomized block design, with four replications, in a factorial model (2 × 2 + 1) : with and without the auxiliary boom, three spray nozzles (<b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> &# 8211; MAG 02, flat fan &# 8211; AD 11002 and air induction <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> &# 8211; TVI 8002) and a control.
