5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a biodegradable scaffold to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a biodegradable scaffold is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for tissue replacement, support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the polymer scaffold would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body. There are reports of using polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid to engineer vascular tissue for <b>heart</b> <b>repair.</b> [...] The scaffold can be used to help create undamaged arteries and vessels.|$|E

A cell–matrix composite was constructed by applying fibrin hydrogel with suspended cells onto decellularized sheets of human myocardium. We then implanted this composite onto the infarct bed in a nude rat model of cardiac infarction.

When implanted by composite scaffold, preconditioned MPCs greatly enhanced vascular network formation in the infarct bed by mechanisms involving the secretion of paracrine factors, such as SDF- 1, and the migration of MPCs into ischemic myocardium, but not normal myocardium. Echocardiography demonstrated the recovery of baseline levels of left ventricular systolic dimensions and contractility when MPCs were delivered via composite scaffold.

Accordingly, we confirmed acceptance of PSCs in MHC-matched allotransplantation. Cardiomyocyte derivation from PSCs and ESCs was equally effective. The use of cardiomyocyte-restricted GFP enabled cell sorting and documentation of advanced structural and functional maturation in vitro and in vivo. This included seamless electrical integration of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes into recipient myocardium. Finally, we enriched cardiomyocytes to facilitate engineering of force-generating myocardium and demonstrated the utility of this technique in enhancing regional myocardial function after myocardial infarction.

In this study, we examined the hypothesis that CDCs favor <b>heart</b> <b>repair</b> by switching the macrophages from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M 1) into a regulatory anti-inflammatory phenotype (M 2). Macrophages from mice were cultured with CDCs-conditioned medium or with fibroblasts-conditioned medium as a control. Immunostaining showed that CDCs-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the expression of CD 206 (a marker for M 2 macrophages), but decreased the expression of CD 86 (a marker for M 1 macrophages) 3 days after culture. For animal studies, we used an acute myocardial infarction model of mice. We injected CDCs, fibroblasts, or saline only into the border zone of infarction. Then we collected the heart tissues for histological analysis 5 and 14 days after treatment. Compared with control animals, CDCs treatment significantly decreased M 1 macrophages and neutrophils but increased M 2 macrophages in the infarcted heart. Furthermore, CDCs-treated mice had reduced infarct size and fewer apoptotic cells compared to the controls.

40|$|Background: Advancing {{structural}} and functional maturation of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes remains a key challenge for applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and <b>heart</b> <b>repair.</b> Here, {{we sought to}} advance cardiomyocyte maturation in engineered human myocardium (EHM) toward an adult phenotype under defined conditions. Methods: We systematically investigated cell composition, matrix, and media conditions to generate EHM from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts with organotypic functionality under serum-free conditions. We used morphological, functional, and transcriptome analyses to benchmark maturation of EHM. Results: EHM demonstrated important {{structural and}} functional properties of postnatal myocardium, including: (1) rod-shaped cardiomyocytes with M bands assembled as a functional syncytium; (2) systolic twitch forces at a similar level as observed in bona fide postnatal myocardium; (3) a positive force-frequency response; (4) inotropic responses to β-adrenergic stimulation mediated via canonical β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptor signaling pathways; and (5) evidence for advanced molecular maturation by transcriptome profiling. EHM responded to chronic catecholamine toxicity with contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte death, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide release; all are classical hallmarks of heart failure. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of EHM according to anticipated clinical demands for cardiac repair.

40|$|AbstractRegenerating {{the human}} heart is a {{challenge}} that has engaged researchers and clinicians around the globe for nearly a century. From the repair of the first septal defect in 1953, followed by the first successful heart transplant in 1967, and later to the first infusion of bone marrow-derived cells to the human myocardium in 2002, significant {{progress has been made}} in <b>heart</b> <b>repair.</b> However, chronic heart failure remains a leading pathological burden worldwide. Why has regenerating {{the human heart}} been such a challenge, and how close are we to achieving clinically relevant regeneration? Exciting progress has been made to establish cell transplantation techniques in recent years, and new preclinical studies in large animal models have shed light on the promises and challenges that lie ahead. In this review, we will discuss the history of cell therapy approaches and provide an overview of clinical trials using cell transplantation for heart regeneration. Focusing on the delivery of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, current experimental strategies in the field will be discussed as well as their clinical translation potential. Although the human heart has not been regenerated yet, decades of experimental progress have guided us onto a promising path. SummaryPrevious work in clinical cell therapy for <b>heart</b> <b>repair</b> using bone marrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiac-derived cells have overall demonstrated safety and modest efficacy.

30|$|However, {{increased}} {{accumulation of}} monocytes appears in inflammatory {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases or cancer [7, 11, 12].

Moreover, monocytes are the inflammatory cell type dominating the infarcted myocardium as they {{play an important role}} in <b>heart</b> <b>repair</b> as well [10, 13]. Moreover, monocytes may represent a therapeutic target after acute myocardial infarction since increased accumulation of monocytes lead to increased inflammation in the infarcted hearts [10, 13].

40|$|Ischemic heart {{diseases}} {{cause the}} destruction of cardiomyocytes and lead to subsequent development of heart failure. Clinical trials demonstrated that transplantation of bone marrow stem cells to patient improves heart function. However, even if the results are clear, the heart function improvement remains weak. It is therefore crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in heart regeneration {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of cell therapy. The aim of this work is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of modulating AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activity in cell therapy for <b>heart</b> <b>repair.</b> Indeed, AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase which acts as a cellular energy gauge controlling many cellular processes. AMPK is known to protect cardiomyocytes against ischemic injuries. AMPK also regulates cell proliferation and mitochondrial biogenesis. All these functions are thought to be involved in processes required by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to home and restore the damaged area. In the present study, we first showed that chronic exposure of mouse MSCs to hypoxia failed to activate AMPK. MSCs are glycolytic and, highly resistant to hypoxia in comparison to cardiomyocytes, MSCs were. This hypoxic tolerance of MSCs could be explained by glycolysis stimulation, which is controlled by transcriptional regulation, independently of AMPK. Secondly, we showed that absence of AMPK induced proliferation and that AMPK activation led to proliferation arrest. This AMPK-mediated proliferation arrest reveals the importance of this enzyme in the regulation of the balance between MSC proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we investigated the role of AMPK in the improvement of cardiogenic differentiation of MSCs. Taken together; our results provide preliminary data that shows that AMPK might be involved in key processes required for cardiogenic differentiation and <b>heart</b> <b>repair.</b> (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
