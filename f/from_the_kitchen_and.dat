5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E
50|$|On {{the same}} day as Titus' birth, an ambitious kitchen boy of {{seventeen}} by the name of Steerpike escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grossly fat, sadistic chef, Abiatha Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave's chief servant, Mr. Flay (Swelter's archenemy), comes upon Steerpike who has become lost in the confines of the castle, and takes him through the castle (large parts of which are uninhabited) to a room outside the quarters of the Earl and the Countess. Here, Steerpike takes the opportunity to spy on the Groan family.|$|R

500|$|Hayley poses as {{a police}} officer and asks Jeff's ex-girlfriend, Janelle, to come {{immediately}} to Jeff's house. Jeff regains consciousness to find that Hayley has bound his wrists and hoisted him to stand on a chair in his kitchen with a noose around his neck. [...] Hayley makes Jeff an offer: if he commits suicide, she promises to erase the evidence of his crimes, but if he refuses, she promises to expose his secrets. The conversation is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on the front door, selling Girl Scout cookies. Hayley tells the neighbor that she is Jeff's niece; the neighbor leaves shortly afterwards. When Hayley returns, Jeff breaks free from his bindings and pursues her, eventually finding her on the roof of his house, where she has lured him. Hayley has brought her rope <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> fashioned it into a noose secured to the chimney. Hayley keeps Jeff at bay with his own gun.|$|E
500|$|Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie {{talks about}} Pat's [...] "frozen willies"—novelty ice cubes—as a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about {{becoming}} her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that [...] "he knows". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a knife into the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela {{is still under}} the table, but Angela enters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> reveals that she left to buy a real cake—the story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie {{wants to talk to}} her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, is electrocuted, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down the stairs with bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card.|$|E

2500|$|Bar Kappara said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar that Nadab and Abihu died (as {{reported}} in [...] ) because of four things: (1) for drawing too near to the holy place, (2) for offering a sacrifice that they had not been commanded to offer, (3) for the strange fire that they brought in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> (4) for not having taken counsel from each other, as [...] says [...] "Each of them his censer," [...] implying that each acted on his own initiative.|$|E

2500|$|As {{time went}} by the Palais was {{increasingly}} overshadowed by the surrounding buildings. By 1907 the Hotel Adlon, occupying {{the site of the}} Palais Redern (originally designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel), towered 5 stories above the embassy. The hotel then bought and integrated the neighbouring Hotel Reichshof at 70a Wilhelmstrasse. The resulting smell <b>and</b> noise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>and</b> loss of light led the last ambassador before the Second World War, Sir Neville Meyrick Henderson, to comment that the embassy was [...] "cramped, dirty and dark". By Henderson's time the embassy had long outgrown its premises and on the outbreak of war in 1939 a new site, large enough to accommodate all of the embassy's functions, was sought in exchange for the existing building.|$|R
