5000|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} the space-charge tetrode was as an <b>electrometer</b> <b>tube</b> for detecting and measuring extremely small currents. For example, the General Electric FP54 {{was described as a}} [...] "space-charge grid tube ... designed to have a very high input impedance and a very low grid current. It is designed particularly for amplification of direct currents smaller than about 10 amperes, and has been found capable of measuring currents as small as 5 x 10 amperes. It has a current amplification factor of 250,000, and operates with an anode voltage of 12v, and space-charge grid voltage of +4V." [...] The mechanism by which the space-charge grid lowers control-grid current in an electrometer tetrode is that it prevents positive ions originating in the cathode from reaching the control grid.|$|E

During the period of charge collection the two condenser plates are electrically shielded from one another by a grounded metal vane inserted between them.

A two pole, triple throw switch allows the output meter to be connected in test 1 position to measure screen grid current, in test 2 position to set tube voltages to reproducible values, and in "Operate" position to measure changes in plate current.

5000|$|The Radiac Survey Meter No 2 or RSM was a 1955-meter {{which used}} an {{ionisation}} chamber to measure gamma radiation, it could measure beta, {{by removing the}} base-plate and opening the beta shield. This meter suffered {{from a number of}} disadvantages: it required three different types of batteries, of which two were obsolete and had to be manufactured to special order, the circuit included a single <b>electrometer</b> valve or <b>tube.</b> These were favored as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and remained in use until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. Within the ROC the RSM was only used at post sites for three years when it was superseded in 1958 by the FSM and the RSM retained only for post attack mobile monitoring missions.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparatus}} to be {{used for}} the C 136 experiments is being extensively modified so that better vacuums may be attained. At the same time, the necessary high resolution of the mass spectrometer is being sought. The failure to obtain the desired resolution is probably traceable to two effects: stray electrostatic fields, and defocusing of the beam by the numerous electrons that accompany the negative ions. Attempts are being made to eliminate both of these effects. Tests show that the concentration of C 136, originally 1 in 5000 with respect to the stable isotopes, can be increased to 1 in 150 by a Szilard-Chalmers reaction. The amount of material available, as well as radioactive hazards, makes it necessary to recirculate the gas by successive trapping with liquid nitrogen. Battery power supplies have been replaced by carefully regulated ac-operated supplies, wherever possible, to avoid failure {{in the middle of a}} run. The ac-operated supplies appear entirely satisfactory. Rotating coil magnetometers are to be installed in all transition fields to allow rapid adjustment, thus eliminating the loss of time (some-times ruinous in experiments on radioactive materials) entailed in finding a transition and "chasing " it up or down with varying field. The apparatus program has been con-cluded with some electrometer developments that are described below. The <b>electrometer</b> <b>tube</b> and galvanometer combination hitherto used to measure ion beam currents had an over-all sensitivity of approximately 10 - 16 amp/mm with a time constant of approximately 8 sec. By using cathode followers to remove the mismatch between the high resistance plate circuit of the electrometer (50 K) and the galvanometer, an additional gain of 100 can be realized. Introducing a highpass filter with an insertion loss of 3 allows the time constant to be reduced to 4 sec, except on the most sensitive range when the Ayrton shunt allows the low impedance output of the cathode follower to shunt the galvanometer, thus increasing the time constant to 10 sec. The improvement in performance can be seen from the table below. Sensitivity Time constant Approximate Shunt loss (amp/mm) (sec) noise (mm...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1958 This {{investigation}} {{is a study}} of how the magnitude and energy distribution of the photoelectric current from the light emergent side of thin silver films varies with film thickness. The Fowler-Dubridge graphical analysis of the energy distribution of photoelectrons is {{used to determine the}} energy of the most energetic of the emitted photoelectrons, at O°K. The experimental phototube is of the concentric: sphere type. The silver film was deposited {{on the inside of the}} sphere to act as a collector for the photoelectrons. The tube was mounted on a vacuum system consisting of a mechanical pump, an oil diffusion pump and an oil vapour trap. During the investigation the tube was left on the pumps at a pressure of approximately 2 x 10 ⁻⁷mm. Hg. The photocurrent from the silver film was amplified with a Brown and Dubridge circuit using a FP- 54 <b>electrometer</b> <b>tube.</b> The film was irradiated by light from a mercury arc lamp and a Bausch and Lomb monochromator. The intensity of light transmitted through the silver film was monitored by an R. C. A. IP 28 electron multiplier phototube. In order to determine the thickness of the silver film a separate experiment was carried out to determine the per cent light transmission through a film of known thickness. The main investigation consisted of depositing a layer of silver on the quartz disc mounted in the center of the experimental tube, and measuring the percentage of transmitted light, of wavelength 2483 A, through the film. The emitted photocurrent was then measured as a function of the light intensity at the light emergent side of the silver film, and as a function of the retarding potential across the experimental phototube. The film was increased in nineteen steps to a maximum thickness of 255 A, and the above data was recorded for each film thickness. The magnitude of the photocurrent increased with film thickness up to about 40 A and was then relatively constant for thicker films. The analysis of the energy distribution of the photocurrent showed an increase of the maximum energy of emission with film thickness up to about 50 A. This increase in maximum energy may be due to a change in contact potential between the collector and the silver film or to a decrease in the work function of the silver film as the thickness increases. A decrease in the work function of the silver film, with increasing thickness, would explain the increase in the emitted photocurrent, with increasing film thickness...|$|E
