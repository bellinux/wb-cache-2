5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
25|$|On {{their return}} from Rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed {{by his son}} Æthelbald. With civil war looming the magnates of the realm met in council to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. {{historical}} Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.|$|E
25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. But the administration did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|They {{applied for}} a federal charter for the {{foundation}} in the US Senate in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President William Howard Taft, through the aegis of Senator Nelson Aldrich, to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> concessions. However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.|$|E

25|$|In early July it {{appeared}} that he had jinxed both their chances with Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent {{at the bottom of}} the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to invite them to a reception at Number 10 to celebrate.|$|E
25|$|In the {{political}} life of Spain, the king {{would already be}} familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a General Election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, {{the political}} leaders would customarily have met beforehand to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a coalition agreements before their meeting with the king. Once appointed, the President of the Government forms an administration whose ministers are appointed and removed by the king on the president's advice. No minister may take up his appointment until after they give their oath of office to obey the constitution with loyalty to the king.|$|E
25|$|After {{blowing the}} tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp {{around the track}} for almost an entire lap, and {{subsequently}} bent the rim. That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any track position advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75mph pace, regardless of position, {{in order to save}} tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.|$|E

[...] Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings. [...] However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included. [...] The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Lully's operas were {{described}} as [...] "tragedies in music" [...] (tragédies en musique). The point of departure was a verse libretto, in most cases by the verse dramatist Philippe Quinault. For the dance pieces, Lully would <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> rough chords and a melody on the keyboard, and Quinault would invent words. For the recitative, Lully imitated the speech melodies and dramatic emphasis used by the best actors in the spoken theater. His attentiveness to transferring theatrical recitation to sung music shaped French opera and song for a century.|$|E

25|$|The steel-pan {{is created}} by {{hammering}} a 55-gallon drum to produce the full chromatic range of scale notes.

The traditional steel-pan was <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> by hand, but with the instrument gaining popularity and worldwide demand, manufacturers have experimented with more efficient methods including Spinforming, Flowforming, Aquaforming and Marforming. A typical pan contains 2½ octaves, with each note being a <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> groove in the pan that produces a distinct note.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the miners}} had {{converted}} their overtime ban into an all-out strike, Prime Minister Edward Heath called a snap general election. Two days before polling day, on Tuesday 26 February, Adamson addressed {{a conference of}} senior managers organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied [...] "if I were them I would try {{to get close to}} the unions and <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> something better (than the Act)", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because [...] "it is so surrounded by hatred that we must have a more honest try at another Act".|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the war, November 1914, Benedict negotiated with the warring parties about an exchange of wounded and other prisoners of war who were unable to continue fighting. Tens of thousands of such prisoners were exchanged through the intervention of Benedict XV. On 15 January 1915, the Pope proposed an exchange of civilians from the occupied zones, which resulted in 20,000 persons being sent to unoccupied Southern France in one month. In 1916, the Pope managed to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an agreement between both sides, by which 29,000 prisoners with lung disease from the gas attacks could be sent into Switzerland. In May 1918, he also reached agreement that prisoners on both sides with at least 18 months of captivity and four children at home would also be sent to neutral Switzerland.|$|E

2500|$|Rapso {{has become}} the most {{influential}} of these two main descendants of calypso; it arose as Black Power and Pan-Africanist thought spread in Trinidad. Lancelot Layne is said to have invented the genre with his 1971 hit [...] "Blow Away", while Cheryl Byron brought rapso to calypso tents in 1976. The term rapso first appeared in 1980 on Busting Out, an album by Brother Resistance and his Network Riddum Band. Rapso {{has become one of the}} most prevalent expressions of music on Trinidad itself, but is largely absorbed into calypso during Carnival celebrations and contests. [...] The 1990s saw a more politically and spiritually-conscious form of rapso, which has been infused with soul and reggae music, as well as native J'ouvert, an early introduction to Carnival which consists of percussionists using makeshift materials to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a beat. The trio band 3canal, and the artist Ataklan, are among the most popular modern proponents.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later Tito arrived and Maclean had to convey Churchill's displeasure at his sudden and unexplained departure. [...] Tito had been to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, to arrange matters with the Soviet High Command. [...] Maclean helped to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a draft agreement, and went to London with it, while Tito's envoys took it to Moscow. [...] "It was a {{difficult}} and thankless task. King Peter, quite naturally, {{was not easy to}} reassure, and Tito, sitting in Belgrade with all the cards in his hand, was not easy to satisfy." [...] The bargaining went on for months, and meanwhile Maclean's staff wanted to get away, to assist guerrilla wars elsewhere. [...] When the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin) met at Yalta in February 1945, and made it clear that Tito and Šubašić had to get on with it, King Peter gave in, and all the pieces fell into place. The regents were sworn in, as was the united government, and the British ambassador flew in. [...] Maclean was finally able to leave.|$|E
2500|$|After the decision, the Harbour Commission {{notified}} the Government of Canada {{that it could}} not continue to run the airport and asked that the Government of Canada take it over. However, the government chose to offer the airport to local interests for 90 days. If no local interest came forward, the Harbour Commission could begin to shut down the airport. The Harbour Commission cited the lack of fixed link, the ban on jets and the potential long response time to a major disaster at the airport. Tonks suggested the Greater Toronto Airports Authority agency running Pearson airport should take over the island airport as well. In September mayor Hall changed her position on the airport. Hall proposed continuing the jet ban but allow the bridge and allow modifications to the noise guidelines to allow U.S. regional airline turboprop planes to land at the airport. A few days later Hall met with federal Transport Minister Doug Young, provincial Transportation Minister Al Palladini, provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach, Tonks and the Harbour Commissioners to <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a deal. Jets were ruled out as, in Young's words, [...] "city councillors appear solidly opposed".|$|E
