5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Haynes married Margery McLeod, born about 1899 in California, and {{the couple}} welcomed a child, Caleb Vance Haynes, Jr., born in Spokane, Washington in 1928. The son, known as Vance Haynes, served in the USAF 1951–1954 in special weapons, then studied {{archaeology}} and geology, earning a doctorate from the University of Arizona in 1965. He became a professor of archaeology at universities in Texas and Arizona, and through his <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> at Sandia Cave, helped establish the timeline of human migration through North America.|$|E
5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} {{research}} of the town, <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> of the nearby mound necropolis in the Nine Mounds area and partial <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> of the surrounding flat necropolises were also performed.

5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> had {{uncovered}} {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E
5|$|Local {{historian}} Yves le Maner {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> to make the site safe for public access. The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de Helfaut. The following year, the Conseil Général du Pas-de-Calais acquired the site. The 69-million-franc project (£7.5 million at 1997 prices) was largely underwritten by the Conseil Général, which provided 35 million francs, with another 17 million coming from the regional council. The European Union provided a further 12 million, the French State provided 3 million and the Saint-Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs; a number of private shareholders were also involved. The Societé d'Equipement du Pas-de-Calais was contracted to carry out the development work, which involved excavating a further two metres (six feet) beneath the dome, clearing out and completing the unfinished concreting of some of the tunnels, building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome.|$|E

25|$|The western {{portion of}} the World Trade Center site was {{originally}} under the Hudson River, with the shoreline {{in the vicinity of}} Greenwich Street. It was on this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street that Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, the Tyger, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in Manhattan. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> in 1916. The remains of a second ship from the eighteenth century were discovered in 2010 during <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 feet below the surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of suitable methods {{to be employed}} for surface <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> is particularly important in geotechnical engineering projects. Factors such as environmental constrains, rock properties and size of site may affect the {{selection of}} machine required for surface excavation. Wrong selection of equipment and technique can result in unrecoverable expenses and thus, should be avoided. Great challenges in <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> are expected in sedimentary rock where the occurrence of discontinuity such as bedding thickness, foliation and the inhomogeneity of rock as well as effect of moisture can greatly affect its excavatability. This paper aims to identify and highlight the factors affecting the <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> in wet tropically weathered sedimentary area as what have been experienced in Malaysia. Some of these factors, however, are not specified in the existing general excavatability assessments. Assessment by practical excavation was carried out at three sedimentary rock sites in Nusajaya, Malaysia, {{taking into account the}} related parameters. Statistical analysis by using SPSS was then being conducted {{in order to determine the}} correlation of each parameter with productivity of excavation and their significance in affecting the excavatability. Based on the results obtained, it was found that the parameters such as Is 50, R, UCS, density, ITS, Js, JL, Jd, IP and moisture content play significant roles in affecting the excavatability of sedimentary rocks. Meanwhile, the existence of bedding, Id 2 and Jn are deemed to be neglected. It is believed that this study can help to enhance the knowledge on factors that complicate the <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> in sedimentary area...|$|R

25|$|The Institution {{approved}} Morley's {{proposal in}} December 1913 and {{one month later}} hired him to direct the project, but instability in Yucatán (an aftershock of the Mexican Revolution) and the World War, among other factors, would postpone action on the proposal for a decade. <b>Excavation</b> <b>work</b> at Chichen Itza did not begin until the 1923–24 field season.|$|E
25|$|An Earth Pressure Balance {{tunnel boring}} machine (TBM) was built {{specifically}} for the Waterview Tunnel at the Herrenknecht factory, Guangzhou, China.
