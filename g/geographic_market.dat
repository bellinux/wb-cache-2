500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on <b>geographic</b> <b>market).</b> According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it.

2500|$|It is {{also our}} view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit {{decisions}} refining and applying it are {{inconsistent with the}} policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by § 1, which [...] "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." [...] Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767-769, 104 S.Ct., at 2739-2740. For these reasons, § 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. Id., at 767, 104 S.Ct., at 2739. The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquir ing only whether the defendant has engaged in [...] "unfair" [...] or [...] "predatory" [...] tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which is something more than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the relevant product and <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> and the defendant's economic power in that market.|$|E

Moreover, growth into new <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> {{appears to be more}} important than discovery of new export products in explaining export growth. Of particular importance is whether an exporting country succeeds in reaching more national markets that are already importing the product it makes. This <b>geographic</b> index of <b>market</b> penetration is a powerful explanatory variable of export performance. This suggests that governments should not focus solely or even primarily on the discovery channel, but also seek to identify and address market failures that are constraining exporters in subsequent phases of the export cycle.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{differences in}} the dynamics of <b>marketing</b> decisions across <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> empirically. We begin with a linear-quadratic game involving forward-looking firms competing on prices and advertising. Based on the corresponding Markov perfect equilibrium, we propose estimable econometric equations for demand and marketing policy. Our model allows us to measure empirically the strategic response of competitors along with economic measures such as firm profitability. We use a rich dataset that combines sales, marketing mix, factor cost, and advertising cost data for eighteen <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> in the frozen entrée category. We find that larger markets {{tend to be less}} price-sensitive and more profitable than smaller markets. We also find evidence of positive carryover of own advertising on own demand. In terms of consumer substitution patterns, we find that the role of advertising (in our data) seems to be more category-building (complementary) than share-stealing (competitive). The complementary role is stronger in larger markets. On the supply side, we find that firms make smaller adjustments to own advertising as goodwill goes up. Consistent with cross-advertising effects on demand, firms make smaller (larger) adjustments to advertising in response to competitive goodwill in the less competitive larger (in the more competitive smaller) markets. Finally, we find that consumer welfare decreases (increases) in larger (smaller) markets when firms move to a zero-advertising regime. competition, advertising, multiple <b>geographic</b> <b>markets,</b> structural models, Markov perfect equilibrium, dynamics, packaged goods...|$|R
