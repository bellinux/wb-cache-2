5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} {{began to}} arise between what {{was perceived as}} president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E

In this paper, I use data from interviews with video game {{players who are}} members of marginalized groups, to interrogate the links made between how players <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> video game characters and the importance of representation.

Different types of games, moreover, shape the types of relationships players have with the onscreen characters.

50|$|Similarly to {{perceived}} organizational support, the organization’s prestige is an antecedent to OI, for as the organization becomes well regarded, the employee “basks in reflected glory” and gladly <b>identifies</b> <b>with</b> its reputation and goals (Bergami & Bagozzi, 2000; Mael & Ashforth, 1992). The stereotypes {{of the organization}} reflect central beliefs and missions of the organization. Further, these stereotypes allow for an individual to indirectly <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> {{the goals of the}} organization. In other words, the individual <b>identifies</b> <b>with</b> the organization as the organization’s ideals become his or her own (Bergami & Bagozzi, 2000).
