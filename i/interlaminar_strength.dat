40|$|The {{criterion}} for the <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> of unidirectional carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates is discussed. To evaluate the limit curve {{given by the}} relation between normal stress and shear stress on the fracture interface, two types of <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> tests were carried out using short beams of CFRP laminates. The {{criterion for}} the interlaminar fracture of the CFRP laminates was investigated in two-dimensional finite element analysis of the CFRP specimens. Interlayers made by carbon nanofiber were inserted between the prepregs of the CFRP laminates. A modified 'Tsai-Wu' criterion was employed to evaluate the critical curve of the interlaminar fracture of the CFRP laminates.

40|$|International audienceThe {{microstructure}} of graphite flake (GF) reinforced aluminum (Al) matrix (Al–GF) composites {{was observed}} in detail. Due to thermal mismatch between Al and GF, an inner structure of GF was damaged in proximity to the Al/GF interface, while the unique bridging of the sticky graphite sheets barely connected the Al matrix and GF. This result suggests that the GF <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> is weaker than the Al/GF interfacial strength; the GF <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> is thus the dominant determinant of the thermomechanical and mechanical properties of the Al–GF composite. Whereas the thermal conductivity of the Al–GF composite was consistent with that theoretically predicted, the outstanding thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the graphite was not reflected in the produced Al–GF composites. The damaged inner structure of GF in proximity to the Al/GF interface contributes to heat transfer but does not bear the load resulting from thermal stress...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{composite}} laminates in many structural applications {{requires that the}} designer be provided with accurate information about <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength.</b> In particular, a knowledge of interlaminar tensile strength may be important in some cases. The delamination coupon, a specially designed angle-ply laminate developed by other investigators, is considered here {{in the role of}} an interlaminar tension test specimen. Exper-imental results obtained with the delamination coupon suggest that the current procedure for design of such specimens must be changed to reduce the effect of interlaminar shear stress on the results, and that more accur-ate analysis must be used before interlaminar tensile strength can be pre-dicted with confidence. <b>INTERLAMINAR</b> <b>STRENGTH</b> NTERLAMINAR STRENGTH HAS long been recognized as an important propertyIfor composite laminates subjected to bending. More recently, analyses and experi-ments have demonstrated the existence of interlaminar stresses in composites sub-jected to in-plane loading. e. g. the angle-ply analysis by Puppo and Evensen [1], the edge-zone analysis by Pipes and Pagano [2], and fatigue experiments reported by Grossman [3]. One can also show, by means of simplified engineering analyses, that interlaminar stresses must be considered in the design of large composite space structures, e. g. at the entrance of a composite tube into a metal fitting. Analysis of this last type has been reported by Burns and Toland [4] Hence, <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> properties must be determined to provide design information, and al-though shear appears to be the dominant interlaminar stress component in most cases, there may be some design situations in which interlaminar tension must be accounted for...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{delamination}} {{resistance of}} a composite plate subjected to low-velocity impact {{is dependent on}} the <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strengths</b> and the level of interlaminar stress. The former is strongly influenced by the material properties such as matrix toughness and fiber-matrix bonding strength while the latter can be affected by the specimen geometry and loading parameters. In this study, some thin composite plates were fabricated and sub-jected to low-velocity impact. The delamination in every specimen was examined. Experi-mental results revealed that the delamination area was proportional to the lamina thickness and the difference of fiber angle between adjacent laminae. A Mismatch Theory based on the difference of bending stiffness between adjacent laminae was used to interpret the cause of high interlaminar stress level. The effect of <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strengths</b> on the delami-nation resistance was also discussed. It was found that through-the-thickness stitching could reduce the delamination area in a composite plate subjected to low-velocity impact as high as 40 %...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyzed}} multi length-scale composites from {{an experimental}} and modeling perspective. Three main experiments were conducted: fatigue of foam and pin-reinforced foam cores, indentation prevention using load spreaders, and nanotube reinforcement for increased <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength.</b> A method for determining cycles to failure for a sandwich panel was established using an empirical model. The fatigue response is captured by conducting experiments at varying stress levels to determine empirical constants. Stress-softening is observed in 92 % of tests under varying fatigue cases, even at low stress amplitudes. A stiffness criterion {{can be developed}} to estimate failure such that once a reduced level of stiffness is reached a structure is removed from service. For load spreaders numerical models showed that a stress concentration develops under {{the corner of the}} load spreader. In light of this, a triangular collapse model was derived using a work balance. The model was found to predict the collapse load within 20 N or 12 % of the failure load. For design purposes the model allows the minimum spreader dimension to be determined by inputting the expected load on a joint. Carbon nanotubes were grown on the surface of carbon and glass fibers using CVD. The heat of the reaction and exposure to high temperature were limited to prevent fiber damage. Nanotubes longer than two times the fiber diameter negatively impact the fiber volume fraction which reduces <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength,</b> but high densities of short nanotubes improve <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength.</b> Gains of up to 29. 4 % were seen in glass, 56. 2 % were seen in Grafil and 36. 2 % were seen in IM 7...|$|E

IM 7 / 977 - 2 and IM 7 / 977 - 3). Low <b>interlaminar</b> shear <b>strength</b> is widely acknowledged as the key barrier to the successful acceptance and implementation of electron beam cured composites in the aircraft/aerospace industry. The objective of this work was to improve the <b>interlaminar</b> shear <b>strength</b> properties of electron beam cured composites by formulating and evaluating several different fiber sizings or coating materials.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of specific strengths of candidate high-temperature materials {{as a function}} of temperature is shown. From this comparison, it is apparent why there is an interest in carbon-carbon composites for applications as a strong, light-weight thermal protection system (TPS), or as hot structure, for applications above 2500 F. The lower bound of the carbon-carbon band is representative of the tensile strength of cross-ply Advanced Carbon-Carbon (ACC). The upper bound represents capabilities of various experimental carbon-carbon composites. Thin carbon-carbon composites, such as would be used as TPS panels or hot aero-structure, are usually constructed of layups of 2 -D fabrics of carbon-fiber yarns (tows). Although the in-plane strengths of these composites can be very attractive, a major problem area is low <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength.</b> The low <b>interlaminar</b> <b>strength</b> {{is the result of a}} relatively weak carbon matrix and poor interaction between the fibers and matrix. The purpose of this paper is to discuss strategies being employed to improve the interlaminar strengths of the materials at the upper bound of the carbon-carbon band, and to present some recent encouraging results. The emphasis of these strategies is to improve interlaminar shear and tensile strengths while maintaining, or even improving, the inplane properties...|$|E
