40|$|INTRODUCTION: Brazil's Federal District (FD) {{has seen}} steep {{population}} growth in recent years, and this has increased demand for high-quality water. AIM: The present work aims to evaluate the quality of surface water from two water bodies in the FD at six sampling points, three {{of which are in}} the Sobradinho River (the receiving body of a sewage treatment plant effluent) and three in the Jardim River (located in an agricultural region). METHODS: Analyses were carried out every thirty days, for twelve months, covering rainy and dry seasons. Parameters were analyzed such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, turbidity, total hardness, main ions, total and fecal coliforms (E. coli) in water. <b>Ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> was also performed, using the micro-crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia. RESULTS: Data of physical and chemical determinations showed DO, conductivity, Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 4 (2 -) and Na+ to be important in indicating contamination by urban effluents. On the subject of biological parameters - E. coli and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> - the former was seen to be more effective in the urban area. However, in the countryside, the assay with C. dubia proved to be the most sensitive, although less than ideal, because the organism is very sensitive to low water hardness. CONCLUSIONS: The fecal coliform indicator (E. coli) was the most effective one for comparing water quality in the two basins, mainly for the urbanized one, while ecotoxicity assays with C. dubia were harmed by the natural chemical composition of the water...|$|E

Daphnid neonates were exposed {{to a range of}} chromium and cadmium concentrations in the absence and presence of the algal cells. Metal speciation calculations using MINEQL(+) showed that total dissolved metal concentrations in zooplankton culture corresponded to 96. 2 % free Cd and 100 % free Cr concentrations. Initial total dissolved metal concentrations were used for 48 h-LC(50) determination. LC(50) for D. similis was 5. 15 x 10 (- 7) mol l(- 1) dissolved Cd without algal cells, whereas with 1 x 10 (5) cells ml(- 1), it was significantly higher (7. 15 x 10 (- 7) mol l(- 1) dissolved Cd). For Cr, the 48 h-LC(50) value of 9. 17 x 10 (- 7) mol l(- 1) obtained for the cladoceran in tests with 1 x 10 (6) cells ml(- 1) of P. subcapitata was also significantly higher than that obtained in tests without algal cells (5. 28 x 10 (- 7) mol l(- 1) dissolved Cr). The presence of algal cells reduced the toxicity of metals to D. similis, as observed in other studies that investigated the effects of food on metal toxicity to standard cladocerans.

40|$|From an {{environmental}} perspective, {{there is a}} need to reduce the amount of biocides from antifouling paints in the marine ecosystem as these biocides can exert a negative effect on the marine life. One way to do this is to optimize the use of biocides in antifouling paints, and thereby avoid unnecessary overdosing. This thesis has been produced within the research program Marine Paint which has the overall aim to produce an antifouling paint with a lower environmental impact than the paints existing on the market today. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis has been to evaluate the efficacy and ecotoxicity of eight antifouling biocides to both target and non-target organisms. The biocides investigated were: medetomidine, triphenylborane pyridine (TPBP), tolylfluanid, copper, irgarol, zinc pyrithione, copper pyrithione and 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl 3 (2 H) -isothiazolone (DCOIT). The target organisms investigated were the macroalga Ulva lactuca and periphyton (i. e. microbial communities). It is important to keep in mind that all target organisms that antifouling biocides are meant to affect, are also non-target organisms when they grow on natural substrates in the marine ecosystem. Therefore, effects on target organisms are not only of interest for efficacy evaluations, but also for ecotoxicological assessments of the biocides. Both the efficacy and ecotoxicity of the eight biocides has been evaluated for the target organisms in settlement assays in which the organisms were allowed to settle and grow in the presence of the biocides. Full concentration-response curves from 0 to 100 % effect were produced to enable future mixture predictions. Such mixture predictions can be used for paint optimization, but also in environmental applications such as hazard assessments. Copper pyrithione was the biocide that most efficiently prevented growth of both Ulva lactuca and periphyton communities, and for Ulva lactuca is was also the biocide with the highest ecotoxicity. Due to different shapes of the concentration-response curves, the toxicity ranking was not consistent at all effect levels (from EC 10 to EC 98), and irgarol was found to be more toxic to periphyton at lower concentrations than copper pyrithione. In order to extend the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the biocides beyond target organisms, effects on the non-target organism Acartia tonsa was investigated. Acartia tonsa is one of the most commonly occurring pelagic calanoid copepods in coastal waters world-wide. Effects on mortality and egg production were studied for three of the eight biocides, namely DCOIT, TPBP and medetomidine. It was shown that neither DCOIT nor medetomidine affected the egg production specifically, but inhibition of egg production occurred at the same concentration as mortality. TPBP was on the other hand shown to affect the egg production at concentrations lower than lethal concentrations. Antifouling biocides present in the marine environment can exert selection pressure on marine life and through the process of natural selection induce tolerance development. An extreme tolerance to the antifouling biocide irgarol in a population of Ulva lactuca from the mouth of the Gullmar fjord has been described. This indicates that the use of antifouling paints has made its imprint on the marine ecosystem. The results from this thesis have deepened the understanding of the biological effects of antifouling biocides. The well-defined concentration-response curves gives information on both efficacy and ecotoxicity, and the information can be used in a number of applications where either biocidal efficacy or ecotoxicity is of interest, such as hazard assessments and in the design of antifouling paints...|$|R

40|$|Since 1970 in Italy the {{cultivation}} of Tapes philippinarum has experienced a rapid expansion in the lagoons and along te coasts of the Northern Adratic Sea, with important economic and social implications. This type of bivalve culture, however, has developed without a precise plan and the necessary technical assistance. Over the past few years, in parallel with the diffusion of this {{and other types of}} mollusc cultures the need to acquire a better knowledge and control of the lagoon environment has arisen. A remarkable problem is the superposition of areas with intense maritime activity and agricultural exploitation with those of mollusc cultivation. Among the main pollutants concerning these areas organotin compounds (OTC) represent one of the most harmful group of substances both for mollusc cultivation and human health, since bivalves are filter-feeding organisms which rapidly bioaccumulate the environmental contaminants. With the aim to study the effects of OTC - already reported to be immunotoxic in mammals - in T. philippinarum, we have investigated whether they exert an immunosuppressant role also on in vitro yeast phagocytosis by haemocytes of this species. The phagocytic index is significantly reduced by OTC in an irreversible manner and depends on concentration and lipophilic affinity, but neither cell mortality nor cytolysis occur.

However, the soil identified as the most toxic using bioassays, {{was different from the}} expected when considering the results from pseudototal and effective bioavailable trace elements. Taking in consideration the observations, it is highly recommended to complement the results from environmental chemistry with results from bioassays, in order to provide a more complete and relevant information on the bioavailability of contaminants and to characterize the risk of contaminated soils...|$|E
40|$|Besides intact plants {{different}} in vitro-systems {{have been used}} for an <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> of chemicals. All plant test systems were able to metabolize the compounds by common metabolic pathways. The results obtained are: all compounds, even non-polar ones, are assimilated by the different plant systems. Uptake depended on the plant species and on the physico-chemical properties of the chemicals. The main metabolites were polar conjugates with plant constituents (carbohydrates, amino acids, glutathione etc.). PAHs were partly converted to oxygenated derivatives which are known to be even more toxic. Depending on the plant species large amounts of the chemicals, and/or their metabolites, were frequently incorporated into bound residues. The association, and type of binding to cell-wall components, enables conclusions to be made about the bioavailability of these non-extractable residues. (orig.)

Title of diploma thesis: Ecotoxicological {{study of}} {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotics mixture This thesis {{is focused on}} <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{of the risk of}} two fluoroquinolone antibiotics - ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. A multigenerational test with a protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, which is based on the model of microbiotest of Protoxkit F, has been used for their evaluation. The inhibitory effect of the tested substances on growth and reproduction of organisms has been observed. The dependence between inhibitory effect and concentration of the pharmaceuticals had been detected, and than the values of 24 h EC 50 have been calculated. During the tests, the phototoxic potential of both antibiotics has been observed and also the mixtures of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 1) have been tested.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with early approaches, XXI century environmental technologies {{aim to be}} less resources consuming concerning energy and materials. Therefore, there is growing interest {{in the use of}} different macrophyte species as a simple and energy efficient method of wastewater treatment. Plants have shown the capacity to withstand relatively high concentrations of chemicals and nutrients being able to transform the compounds into less toxic metabolites. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficiency of two emergent macrophytes naturally occuring in Portugal, Phragmites australis and Iris pseudacorus, on the treatment of urban effluent through the characterisation of wastewater before and after the treatment, at physico-chemical and ecotoxicological levels. Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse under monitored conditions. Plantations of the two species were done oa a two layer bed of gravel (5 cm) and sand (25 cm) in tanks of 120 l. results of physico-chemical parameters and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the wastewater will be presented an...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of contaminated matrices introduced into the ecosystem in terms of ecotoxicity. It is focused mainly on matrix generated by anthropogenic activities, especially waste of various origin - industrial, energetical, biodegradable and more. For experimental purposes sewage sludge as the bulk waste with the ever-increasing production was selected. Sewage sludge was tested at its most common use - application on the agricultural land. This application is limited by legislative through the concentration limits of hazardous elements. For this reason, the potential ecotoxicity of sludge was evaluated. <b>Ecotoxicological</b> <b>evaluation</b> was performed using the contact bioassays. As the test organisms Eisenia foetida, Folsomia candida, Heterocypris incongruens a plant Lactuca sativa were selected. Sludge from wastewater treatment plants Brno - Modřice, Valtice, Mikulov and Lednice was tested. Samples of sewage sludge showed no ecotoxicity, while respecting the application amount established by the regulation. On the contrary, {{it can be concluded}} that soils enriched by sewage sludge show positive effect on soil biota...|$|E
