His family set out to the Salt Lake Valley in 1848. Though only 8 years old, Lyman helped <b>drive</b> a <b>yoke</b> of cattle and the wagon. He was baptized by his father in the Elkhorn River on July 1, 1848, and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on October 19, 1848.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the 700R4, most 200-4Rs have a multicase {{bellhousing}} for {{use with}} Chevrolet, Buick/Olds/Pontiac (BOP), and Cadillac engines. However, 200-4Rs share mounting locations with the TH-400. Since the external dimensions {{are similar to the}} TH-350 (overall length, <b>drive</b> shaft <b>yoke</b> spline count/diameter and general size), 200-4Rs are often swapped in place of TH-350s in older vehicles to provide an overdrive gear. Early models had PRND321 on the cluster, while later models had PRN(D)D21, with the left D identified as the overdrive gear by a square or oval ring.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: This photo shows {{both the}} top and one side of Tide Predicting Machine No. 2. The tide {{prediction}} formula implemented by the machine includes {{the addition of a}} series of cosine terms. The triangular metal pieces are part of slotted yoke cranks which convert circular motion to a vertical motion that traces a sinusoid. Each slotted yoke crank is connected by a shaft to a pulley, which causes the pulley to follow the sinusoidal motion. A chain going over and under pulleys sums each of their deflections to compute the tide. Along the top of the photo, connecting shafts <b>drive</b> slotted <b>yoke</b> cranks {{on both sides of the}} machine. One side of the machine computes the height of tides while the other determines the times of high and low tides.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the THM400 known as a THM375 is a THM400 with a long output shaft that mates to the smaller THM350 <b>drive</b> shaft <b>yoke.</b> It can be {{identified}} by [...] "375-THM" [...] cast into the tailhousing. Internally the clutch packs originally had fewer friction plates. THM375s were found in some 1971-76 Buicks. Some [...] "Heavy Duty" [...] THM350s were also designated THM375-B. Another variant is the 3L80HD, {{often referred to as}} a Turbo 475. The 3L80HD has a straight-cut planetary gear set. There is no externally visible way to determine whether the transmission contains the straight-cut planetary gear set. The THM425 front wheel drive transmission shares almost all its internal parts with the THM400. Checker Motors Corporation Motor Company used the Chevrolet version of the THM400 for its [...] "A" [...] series taxi and Marathon models until the end of production in 1982.|$|R
50|$|The Traxxas Slash was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though {{not as high as}} the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor. The 2.2/3.0 design was to clear the slayers revo-spec pillow ball suspension components, Traxxas high current battery connectors, metal transmission gears, new waterproof XL-5 ESC, Waterproof 2075 steering servo, 4 channel micro receiver, sealed water tight receiver box, adjustable camber links, rubber sealed ball bearings, nerf bars, hex hardware, light duty <b>drive</b> shaft <b>yokes,</b> new battery hold-downs, short-course truck style bumpers, progressive rate springs, and a wide short course truck style body that encompasses the tires are some of its features. The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch <b>yoke</b> type <b>drive</b> may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch <b>yoke</b> <b>drives</b> need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} work is described {{dealing with the}} small-amplitude dynamic characteristics of plane four-bar linkages with prismatical links, one link being fixed in space. The object is to devise methods by which a design can be investigated as a vibrating system, given that it is already kinematically suited to its task. The theoretical work {{is based on the}} assumption that only flexural vibrations are important, and uses the method of receptances to establish frequency equations which are then solved numerically to compare with the experimental results. The fundamental natural frequencies of the linkage were studied by free vibration tests and fundamental resonant response curves were obtained under conditions of forcing. The input was a mechanical scotch <b>yoke</b> <b>drive</b> when the links were flexible and an electro-magnetic exciter when the links were rigid. Comparison of experiment and theory shows extremely good agreement for natural frequencies over wide ranges of configuration and acceptable agreement for the forced response curves...|$|R

He was asked how he had come there, {{and the reason for}} his journey, his name and his country. He said 'Athens, the famous city, is my home, Triptolemus, my name. I came not by ship, on the sea, or by foot, over land. The clear air parted for me. I bring you the gifts of Ceres. If you scatter them through the wide fields, they will give you back fruitful harvests, and ripening crops.' The barbarian was jealous. So that he might be the author, of so great a gift, he received him like a guest, but attacked Triptolemus, with a sword, while he was in deep sleep. As he attempted to pierce the youth's breast, Ceres turned the king into a lynx, then ordered the youth Athenian to <b>drive</b> the sacred <b>yoke</b> back through the air." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 {{monochrome}} unit measuring 9 Ã— 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob {{on the back of}} the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to <b>drive</b> the deflection <b>yoke.</b> This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new mechanical design for an exoskeleton actuator {{to power the}} sagittal plane motion in the human hip. The device uses a DC motor to <b>drive</b> a Scotch <b>yoke</b> mechanism and series elasticity {{to take advantage of}} the cyclic nature of human gait and to reduce the maximum power and control requirements of the exoskeleton. The Scotch yoke actuator creates a position-dependent transmission that varies between 4 : 1 and infinity, with the peak transmission ratio aligned to the peak torque periods of the human gait cycle. Simulation results show that both the peak and average motor torque can be reduced using this mechanism, potentially allowing a less powerful motor to be used. Furthermore, the motor never needs to reverse direction even when the hip joint does. Preliminary testing shows the exoskeleton can provide an assistive torque and is capable of accurate position tracking at speeds covering the range of human walking. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of how the dynamic nature of human walking can be leveraged, how the hip actuator was designed, and shows how the exoskeleton performed during preliminary human trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContrast-dependent {{interactions}} between classical (CRF) and non-classical regions (nCRF) of visual neuron receptive fields are well documented in primate visual cortex. Physiological models that describe CRF and nCRF interactions in single neurons {{have recently been}} applied to psychophysical measures of spatial summation and suppression in motion perception of young adults (Tadin & Lappin, 2005). We wished to determine whether such models {{could account for the}} reduction in spatial suppression that occurs in normal aging (Betts et al., 2005). We applied three models to duration thresholds obtained in a simple motion discrimination task using drifting Gabor stimuli that ranged in spatial frequency from 0. 5 to 4 c/deg. We found that a model in which the center CRF and surrounding nCRF are represented as spatially-overlapping excitatory and inhibitory 2 D Gaussians with independent contrast response functions, which we call the Gain model, could account for the effects of aging simply by increasing the spatial extent of the CRF. Two additional models were evaluated. The Size model, which varied the size of the CRF as a function of contrast, produced CRF and nCRF size constants that departed significantly from physiological estimates of receptive field sizes. The <b>Drive</b> model, which <b>yoked</b> the activation of the suppressive nCRF to the CRF response, yielded reasonable fits to the data and suggested an age-related decline in the strength of suppression from the nCRF. However, the Drive model estimated the CRF size parameter to be equal to, or even slightly larger than, the nCRF size parameter, which is inconsistent with the physiological literature. Our findings therefore suggest that the Gain model provides the most plausible estimates of receptive field sizes. Based on this model, age-related increases in the size of central excitatory receptive fields relative to the inhibitory surrounds may contribute to behavioral measures of reduced spatial suppression found in older observers...|$|R
