5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000â€“1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{might use}} an internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> on biofuels, {{such as a}} flexible-fuel <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> on ethanol or engines running on biodiesel. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, capable of running on gasoline or E85.|$|E

25|$|The new 5.0 {{incorporates}} piston {{cooling oil}} jets that helped warm the engine faster {{and keep the}} <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> cooler under load. Racing style tubular headers replaced the standard cast iron headers. Coolant and oil flow patterns were optimized for proper flow when under high lateral forces, such as those experienced when on a road course track.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{stroking}} {{will occur}} in a correctly adjusted two stroke engine at full throttle without load when the air-fuel mixture becomes overly rich and prevents the <b>engine</b> from <b>running</b> faster. At such high speeds too lean mixture will cause the engine to over-rev as well as overheat, and in <b>engines</b> <b>running</b> on premixed fuel a too lean mixture will cause poor lubrication.|$|R

25|$|The fuel in {{an engine}} {{has to be}} vaporized before it will burn. Insufficient {{vaporization}} is a known problem with alcohol fuels during cold starts in cold weather. As the heat of vaporization of butanol {{is less than half}} of that of ethanol, an <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> on butanol should be easier to start in cold weather than one running on ethanol or methanol.|$|E

25|$|Making the new Taurus {{pleasing}} to the senses was {{a recurring theme}} throughout the third-generation Taurus' development. Ford's engineers specially tuned every panel and component, so that every sound that the Taurus made, from the doors closing to the <b>engine</b> <b>running,</b> was acoustically pleasing. Ford's trim designers specially selected {{every one of the}} Taurus' interior materials, so that every surface, as well as every button and control, was {{pleasing to}} the touch.|$|E

25|$|A flow bench tests ports under {{a steady}} {{pressure}} difference {{while in the}} actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow bench test exist only fleetingly if at all in an actual running <b>engine.</b> <b>Running</b> engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.|$|E
25|$|ED95 designates a {{blend of}} 95% ethanol and 5% {{ignition}} improver; it is used in modified diesel engines where high compression is used to ignite the fuel, {{as opposed to the}} operation of gasoline engines, where spark plugs are used. This fuel was developed by Swedish ethanol producer SEKAB. Because of the high ignition temperatures of pure ethanol, the addition of ignition improver is necessary for successful diesel engine operation. A diesel <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> on ethanol also has a higher compression ratio and an adapted fuel system.|$|E
25|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} is {{the measure}} of how much light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID burners give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID burner produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption means less fuel consumption, with resultant less CO2 emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> time is with the lights on).|$|E

Additionally, the engine also ran a number of shuttles into the wagon works complex from the railway station, top-and-tailing the workings with NER Class P3 No.65894 from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} marked patrol {{vehicle for}} response and neighbourhood officers {{has been the}} Vauxhall Astra although these are gradually being phased out in favour of automatic Vauxhall Insignias. A number of Peugeot 308, Peugeot Expert cage vans, LDV Maxi cage vans and Ford Focus vehicles {{are included in the}} fleet also. All of these vehicles are modified for police usage with radios installed, lights, sirens and a 'run lock' facility enabling officers to take the keys out of the ignition without stopping the <b>engine</b> <b>running,</b> thereby ensuring the battery isn't depleted if the lights need to left on for long periods.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{framework}} of this concept the administration concluded a big contract with the Aerojet General company in 1959 to research the possibility of designing an SRLD suitable for army purposes. Aerojet {{came to the conclusion}} that the version with the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> on hydrogen peroxide was most suitable. However, it soon became known to the military that engineer Wendell Moore of the Bell Aerosystems company had for several years been carrying out experiments to make a personal jet device. After becoming acquainted with his work, servicemen during August 1960 decided to commission Bell Aerosystems with developing an SRLD. Wendell Moore was appointed chief project engineer.|$|E

25|$|On 26 September 2011, the MAK {{released}} its report {{concluding that the}} cause of the accident was the erroneous actions of the crew during the flight and approach in instrumental meteorological conditions with one <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> (out of three), which resulted in the aircraft approaching significantly {{to the right of the}} extended center line, exiting the runway after landing and colliding with an embankment. The flight engineer accidentally shut off a fuel pump while transferring fuel. As a result, fuel consumption fluctuated, leading to unusual altitude and engine readings before the outer two engines shut down. At this point, the crew chose to bring the plane to Domodedovo Airport. The report said that the crew had not used all available options to deal with the loss of engine power and had not followed procedures for landing with two nonfunctional engines. The report also noted that the crew had not been sufficiently trained to deal with the situation.|$|E
