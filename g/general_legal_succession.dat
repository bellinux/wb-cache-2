40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the fact of community of life, financial standing and work ability of the inheritor to the construction of the rules of intestate succession in the contemporary European legal systems. In a certain number of the European countries, these facts have an independent impact to the establishment of the intestate succession rules, while their <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> significance becomes important even in the countries where it does not represent an independent basis for the acquisition of the capacity of a legal inheritor. A special focus has been given to consideration of the concrete legal solutions and corresponding <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> ramifications in every legislation where some of the stated facts or even several of such facts, have a corresponding impact to the intestate succession. Bearing in mind that all of these facts {{have an impact on the}} <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> in domestic legislation as well, author points, among other things, on the advantages of this legislation...|$|R

40|$|When {{works of}} art and {{cultural}} heritage {{are found to be}} restitutable property it is usually not clear who is entitled to receive the objects. This essay describes what happens after a decision on restitution from Austrian museums, collections or libraries concerning the procedure and the physical handing over of the objects. In most cases the Jewish Community of Vienna (IKG) conducts the researches to identify the rightful heirs as – concerning federal museums and collections – the finding of the legal successors is not done ex officio. In the foreground is the intention to return the objects to their rightful owner(s), regardless {{of the value of the}} objects, furthermore to take all necessary steps to ascertain the <b>legal</b> <b>succession.</b> The <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> is the "legitimate trans-generational transmission of the matter" (Dan Diner). At its end there are the rightful heirs to whom the legal title is transferred. The Jewish Community of Vienna also supports the heirs – who are often from the children‘s or grandchildren‘s generation – with the bureaucratic needs for the return of objects of art. In this context, one is confronted with numerous difficulties. This concerns the fact that the researches concerning the <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> or parts of the <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> can remain inconclusive. On the other hand the return of restitution objects is sometimes associated with an emotional burden for the heirs and initiates the examination of their own family history. Since 1998 the Jewish Community Vienna has found approximately 270 legal heirs or provided evidences to the legal successors in about 200 cases of restitution from federal museums and collections. The IKG also conducts researches in numerous cases for the collections of Austrian provinces, in Germany and for several libraries. Without determining the rightful heirs the legal title could not be restored and thus this research has a central role in the matter of art restitution...|$|R

In order to introduce and analyse the topic thoroughly at first the main legal acts connected with relationships of obligation and trade relationships of obligations in both compared countries are being introduced.

The specific trade relationships of obligation that are being analysed and compared in both legal systems are namely contract with a commission agent, contract of consignment, forwarding contract and storage contract...|$|R

40|$|The {{author of}} this paper {{analyses}} the legal position of cohabitation partners with regard to succession as defined in contemporary European jurisdictions, focusing on the significant differences that may be observed concerning various aspects of their succession regulations. The author argues that {{although there is a}} whole range of different rules dealing with the succession of cohabitation partners, which certainly are an obstacle on the path to their alignment within EU, the mechanisms adopted in the studied jurisdictions do seem to go in the direction of unification of this area of private law, too. Nevertheless, given the particular character of this area of law and the relationships that it regulates, such unification shall - in author's opinion - take longer time than it is required for some other areas of law. At the same time, it is the author's belief that the factual cohabitation as it exists in domestic law, with its shortcomings herein presented, should not be recognised as a ground for <b>legal</b> <b>succession,</b> whilst, provided there is a revision of the concept of cohabitation in domestic law reflected in addition of the requirement of its registration, the domestic law should consider introducing the mutual <b>legal</b> <b>succession</b> between cohabitation partners...|$|R
