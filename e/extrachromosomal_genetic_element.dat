50|$|The American {{molecular}} biologist Joshua Lederberg first introduced the term plasmid in 1952 - originally to describe any bacterial genetic material {{that exists in}} an extrachromosomal state for {{at least part of}} its replication cycle. Later in 1968, it was decided that the term plasmid should be adopted as the term for <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element,</b> and to distinguish it from viruses, the definition was narrowed to genetic elements that exist exclusively or predominantly outside of the chromosome and can replicate autonomously.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{integrative}} non-conjugative <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element,</b> denoted as pSSVi, {{has been}} isolated from a Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2 strain and was characterized. This genetic element is a double-stranded DNA of 5740  bp {{in size and}} contains eight open reading frames (ORFs). It resembles members of the pRN plasmid family in genome organization but shows only weak similarity to the latter in conserved regions. pSSVi has a copG gene {{similar to that of}} a pRN plasmid, encodes a large replication protein which, unlike a typical pRN RepA, contains no polymerase/primase domain, and lacks the plrA gene. Interestingly, pSSVi encodes an SSV-type integrase which probably catalyzes the integration of its genome into a specific site (a tRNAArg gene) in the S. solfataricus P 2 genome. Like pSSVx, pSSVi can be packaged into a spindle-like viral particle and spread with the help of SSV 1 or SSV 2. In addition, both SSV 1 and SSV 2 appeared to replicate more efficiently in the presence of pSSVi. Given the versatile genetic abilities, pSSVi appears to be well suited for a role in horizontal gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reported}} previously (1) two unexpected {{consequences of the}} microinjection into fertilized mouse eggs of a recombinant plasmid designated p 12 B 1, carrying a 343 bp insert of non-repetitive mouse DNA. Injected at very low concentrations, this plasmid could be established as an <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element.</b> When injected in greater concentration, an early arrest of embryonic development resulted. In the present work, we have studied this toxic effect in more detail by microinjecting short synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences from the mouse insert. Lethality {{was associated with the}} nucleotide sequence GTCACATG, identical with the CDEl element of yeast centromeres. Development of injected embryos was arrested between the one-cell and the early morula stages, with abnormal structures and DNA contents. Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNAse foot-printing assays demonstrated the binding of mouse nuclear protein(s) to the CDEl-like box. Base changes within the CDEl sequence prevented both the toxic effects in embryos and the formation of protein complex in vitro, suggesting that protein binding at such sites in chromosomal DNA {{plays an important role in}} early development...|$|E

40|$|We have {{presented}} direct evidence {{that at least}} one of the traits associated with killing of paramecia by kappa particles is determined by an <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>element.</b> Plasmid DNA was isolated from Caedibacter taeniospiralis 47 (commonly known as 47 kappa), which is an obligate cytoplasmic endosymbiont of Paramecium tetraurelia. Fragments of pKAP 47 DNA generated by Pst I digestion were inserted into pBR 328 and then introduced into Escherichia coli 294 by transformation. Clones carrying recombinant plasmids were screened for toxicity toward sensitive strains of paramecia or for the ability to produce R bodies. None of the clones appeared to be toxic. However, three clones were found to have the ability to produce R bodies, which are proteinaceous ribbons (10 - 20 microns long, 0. 5 microns wide, and 13 nm thick) rolled up inside the cell to form a hollow cylinder about 0. 5 microns in diameter and 0. 5 microns long. Each of these clones carry plasmids that contain the Pst I B fragment from pKAP 47. Subclones of one of the recombinant plasmids, pBQ 51, were constructed to determine the approximate location of DNA sequences necessary for R-body synthesis. The left-hand boundary of the required sequences was found to occur within a 600 -base-pair region, and the location of the right-hand boundary was determined to occur within a 700 -base-pair region.

40|$|During recent years, {{considerable}} credence {{has been}} given to the thesis that the occurrence and spread of multiply resistant enteric bacteria are related to transfer from one cell to another of the genetic determinants of drug resistance. These resistance determinants are borne by complex <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> termed episomes, that also bear determinants of fertility. Resistance transfer takes place through conjugal union, or mating between resistant donor cells and sensitive recipients. During mating the fertility determinant is transferred as well as the resistance genes associated with it, while other parts of the donor genome are not generally involved. Having acquired the fertility factor, the newly resistant cells are enabled thereby to act in turn as donors of resistance determinants to other sensitive cells. Resistance transfer can occur under natural circumstances, such as within the human gastrointestinal tract, and transfer between different species and genera occurs as readily as transfer between different strains of the same species.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the genome-wide transcriptional response of the hyperthermophilic, aerobic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus to UV damage, we used high-density DNA microarrays which covered 3, 368 genetic features encoded on the host genome, {{as well as the}} genes of several <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements.</b> While no significant up-regulation of genes potentially involved in direct DNA damage reversal was observed, a specific transcriptional UV response involving 55 genes could be dissected. Although flow cytometry showed only modest perturbation of the cell cycle, strong modulation of the transcript levels of the Cdc 6 replication initiator genes was observed. Up-regulation of an operon encoding Mre 11 and Rad 50 homologs pointed to induction of recombinational repair. Consistent with this, DNA double-strand breaks were observed between 2 and 8 h after UV treatment, possibly resulting from replication fork collapse at damaged DNA sites. The strong transcriptional induction of genes which potentially encode functions for pilus formation suggested that conjugational activity might lead to enhanced exchange of genetic material. In support of this, a statistical microscopic analysis demonstrated that large cell aggregates formed upon UV exposure. Together, thi...|$|R
40|$|In {{all three}} domains of life, DNA {{replication}} begins at specialized loci termed replication origins. In bacteria, replication initiates from a single, clearly defined site. In contrast, eukaryotic organisms exploit {{a multitude of}} replication origins, dividing their genomes into an array of short contiguous units. Recently, the multiple replication origin paradigm has also been demonstrated within the archaeal domain of life, with the discovery that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus has three replication origins. However, the evolutionary mechanism driving the progression from single to multiple origin usage remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Aeropyrum pernix, a distant relative of Sulfolobus, has two origins. Comparison with the Sulfolobus origins provides evidence for evolution of replicon complexity by capture of <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements.</b> We additionally identify a previously unrecognized candidate archaeal initiator protein that is distantly related to eukaryotic Cdt 1.

40|$|The aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol {{antibiotics}} constitute {{one of the}} {{antibacterial agent}} families with greater activity upon aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. These compounds are formed by the combination of one amino-cyclic alcohol (aminocyclitol) and aminosaccharides (aminoglycosides) linked by glycosidic bonds. The strong bactericidal activity exhibited for these compounds is not only explained by their ability to inhibit the protein synthesis, but also by pleiotropic effect altering the permeability of cytoplasmatic membrane. The penetration of these antibiotics to the bacterial cells is mediated by three well defined phases, being the two latest dependant of the proton-motive force. This fact explains {{that this kind of}} compounds have no antibacterial activity upon anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides is mainly due to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AME), which are commonly encoded by <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> as are plasmids and transposons. Nevertheless, new mechanisms of resistance and <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> participating in the resistance to these compounds have been identified.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Some {{bacterial}} plasmids carry {{antibiotic resistance}} genes and replicate by an asymmetric, rolling circle mechanism, in which replication {{of the two}} strands is not concurrent. Initiation of this replication occurs via an initiator protein that nicks one DNA strand at the double-stranded origin of replication. In this work, RepD protein from the staphylococcal plasmid pC 221 carries this function and allows PcrA helicase to bind and begin unwinding the plasmid DNA. This work uses whole plasmid constructs as well as oligonucleotide-based mimics of parts of the origin to examine the initiation reaction. It investigates the phenomenon that nicking, although required to open a single-stranded region at the origin and so allow PcrA to bind, is not required for another function of RepD, namely to increase the processivity of PcrA, allowing it to unwind plasmid lengths of DNA. A kinetic mechanism of RepD initiation is presented, showing rapid binding of the origin DNA. The rate of nicking varies with {{the structure of the}} DNA but can occur with a rate constant of> 25 s − 1 at 30 °C. The equilibrium constant of the nicking reaction, which involves a transesterification to form a phosphotyrosine bond within the RepD active site, is close to unity.

40|$|International audienceAt present {{very little}} is known about {{interactions}} between <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in Archaea. Here we describe an Acidianus strain which carries naturally a novel 28 kb conjugative plasmid-like element, pAH 1, and also serves as a laboratory host for lipothrixvirus AFV 1. In an attempt to establish a system for studying plasmid-virus interactions we characterized the genome of pAH 1 which closely resembles those of the Sulfolobus conjugative plasmids pARN 3 and pARN 4. pAH 1 integrates site specifically into, and excises from, the host chromosome indicating a dynamic interaction with the latter. Although nucleotide sequence comparisons revealed extensive intergenomic exchange during the evolution of archaeal conjugative plasmids, pAH 1 was shown to be stably maintained suggesting that the host system is suitable for studying plasmid-virus interactions. AFV 1 infection and propagation leads to a loss of the circular form of pAH 1 and this effect correlates positively with the increase in the intracellular quantity of AFV 1 DNA. We infer that the virus inhibits plasmid replication since no pAH 1 degradation was observed. This mechanism of archaeal viral inhibition of plasmid propagation is not observed in bacteria where relevant bacteriophages either are dependent on a conjugative plasmid for successful infection or are excluded by a resident plasmid...|$|R

The killer phenotype (K+) can be encoded by <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> (EGEs) as double stranded DNA or RNA molecules (dsDNA, dsRNA) or in nuclear genes. The spectrum of action and the activity of killer toxins are influenced by temperature, salinity and pH of media.

The assays were performed in strains belonging to three yeast genera used as sensitive cells and under a wide range of pH and temperatures. Approximately 51 % of isolates tested showed toxicity against at least one sensitive yeast strain under the conditions tested. The K+ P. anómala isolates showed a wide spectrum of action and two of them had toxic activity against strains of the three yeast genera assayed, including C. albicans strains. In all S. cerevisiae K+ isolates an extrachromosomal dsRNA molecule (4. 2 Kb) was observed, contrary to P. anómala K+ isolates, which do not possess any EGEs.

To date, {{this is the most}} complex fully sequenced plasmid complement of any gram-negative bacterium. The plasmid complement comprises two pPT 23 A-like replicons, pPMA 4326 A (46, 697 bp) and pPMA 4326 B (40, 110 bp); a pPS 10 -like replicon, pPMA 4326 C (8, 244 bp); and two atypical, replicase-deficient replicons, pPMA 4326 D (4, 833 bp) and pPMA 4326 E (4, 217 bp).

Broad-host-range IncP plasmids are known to spread genes between distinct phylogenetic groups of bacteria. These genes often code for resistances to {{a broad spectrum of}} antibiotics, heavy metals and quaternary ammonium compounds used as disinfectants. The backbone of these plasmids carries modules that enable them to effectively replicate, move to a new host via conjugative transfer and to be stably maintained in bacterial cells.

Environmental studies have demonstrated the wide distribution of IncP-like replicons in manure, soils and wastewater treatment plants.

Their broad distribution suggests that IncP plasmids {{play a crucial role in}} bacterial adaptation by utilizing horizontal gene transfer. This review summarizes the variety of genetic information and physiological functions carried by IncP plasmids, which can contribute to the spread of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance while also mediating the process of bioremediation of pollutants. Due to the location of the resistance genes on plasmids with a broad host range and the presence of transposons carrying these genes it seems that the spread of these genes would be possible and quite hazardous in infection control.

Because <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in yeast are present in multiple copies, perpetuation of an extrachromosomal trait could occur by the passive envelopment of a subset of copies or by an active sequestering of all or a subset of copies within the four spores.

However, electron micrographs of serial sections through yeast asci indicate that the four spore enclose only 30 % of the total ascus material. Thus these extrachromosomal elements are preferentially included within the spores, indicating that their inheritance is not a random process. Transmission of mitochondrial DNA can be accounted for by the observed enclosure of 52 % of the mitochondrial volume within the spores.

40|$|The term “genome ” was {{proposed}} by H. Winkler in 1920 {{to describe a}} combination of genes included in a haploid set of chromosomes of a single biological species [1]. Already at that time, it was emphasized that, unlike genotype, the concept of genome is a characteristic of a species as a whole rather than of an individual. Intensive investigation of genomes during {{the last fifty years}} has noticeably changed the concepts of their structure and function. As the complete primary structure of the human genome was established along with quite a num-ber of animal, plant, and microbial genomes, humankind entered the “post genomic era”. Now the term “genome ” includes the combination of DNA of a hap-loid set of chromosomes that are included in a single cell of germ line of a multicellular organism.

Sulfolobus solfataricus was chosen as a model host system for the study of gene transfer and regulation since it is a good recipient for viruses and plasmids; moreover, the knowledge of its genomic organisation by genome sequencing, gene cloning and expression, is in good progress. An E. coli/Sulfolobus shuttle vector, the pEXSs, was obtained, inserting in an E. coli plasmid the genomic replication sequence of the S. shibate virus particle SSV 1 and using a thermoadapted version of the hygromicin phosphotransferase as the selective acquired phenotype. In order to obtain a higher copy number plasmid, the natural S. islandicus multicopy plasmid pRN 1 was used to construct an E. coli/Sulfolobus shuttle vector, the pHYG* by fusing it with the E. coli plasmid pGEM 7 zf(+) and providing it with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene as selectable marker; since it has been demonstrated the pHYG* to be instable and to suffer rearrangment and/or deletions, attemps are being done to overcome recombination events.

Cytoplasmic male sterility, is an example, where such a conflict may arise; in this case over the sexual development of carrier plants. A factor complicating the organization and control of the genetic material in plants even more, is the existence of mitochondrial plasmids. Mitochondrial plasmids have been reported to show deviations from strict maternal inheritance and to have effects on the sexual development of their carriers. These <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> can be regarded as a third level of genome organization. In plants carrying mitochondrial plasmids conflicts of interest are therefore possible between three genetic actors: the chromosomes in the nucleus, the mitochondrial genome, and the plasmid DNA/RNA. Theoretical models were set up to extend our understanding of how such conflicts can develop and to study which parameters are of importance for the spread and maintenance of mitochondrial plasmids in plant populations. They show that some degree of paternal transmission via pollen is important for the spread of mitochondrial plasmids. The analyses also show that the most likely long-term evolutionary direction is towards plasmids with weak phenotypic effects and a strict maternal mode of transmission. To investigate the parameters for plasmid spread and evolution, we chose to study the naturally occurring weed Silene vulgaris, the bladder campion, a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which carries mitochondrial plasmids. Three different length variants of mitochondrial plasmids of S. vulgaris could be recognized and they were distributed among populations over the whole investigated area of Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. The plasmids of S. vulgaris show no deviation from strict maternal inheritance. Neither were any effects detected on their host plants? fitness or sexual development that could be separated from effects caused by the background cytoplasm. The mitochondrial plasmids of S. vulgaris seem to have reached a state of almost perfect maternal transmission and of weak phenotypic effects, as predicted by the models. The existence of male sterility in S. vulgaris cannot be explained by the occurrence of mitochondrial plasmids. However, there is evidence for both cytoplasmic and nuclear genes being involved in sex-determination. In S. vulgaris, as in several other gynodioecious species, so called gynomonoecious (i. e. partially male sterile) individuals are sometimes found. The standard explanation for the occurrence of this third gender is incomplete nuclear restoration of male-sterilizing cytoplasms. Here, an alternative interpretation is given to partial male sterility in S. vulgaris: Heteroplasmy of factors involved in sexual development can produce the mosaic of flowers found in gynomonoecious plants, as well as the differences in gender proportions among offspring from flowers of different types on a single plant...|$|R
40|$|Glutamate {{excretion}} by {{colonies of}} Citrobacter intermedium C 3 {{was detected by}} using the auxotrophic strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides P- 60. A constant ratio of strain C 3 colonies did not excrete glutamate. These colonies were subcultured, and colonial analysis of their descendants established that the change from non-excretor to excretor (Sg− → Sg+) is a spontaneous and random process with occurs at a high rate, and that an equilibrium state results from the back-transition Sg+ → Sg− in large populations. Acridine orange, ethidium bromide, and shaking have a strong influence on Sg+-to-Sg− interconversion, which suggests that a <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> like an episome is implicated (S factor). Various auxotrophic mutants of bacterial strain C 3 have been cured of the S factor. Strains lacking the S factor (S− strains) do not excrete glutamate and lose their fermentative metabolism completely. Consequently, the S factor is different from other <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genetic</b> factors whose elimination does not modify central metabolism. The gain of the S factor by infectious transfer has been shown with different C 3 auxotrophic mutant strains. Also, the S factor has been transferred to Paracolobactrum intermedium ATCC 11606. These findings suggest that phenotypic changes observed are a consequence of elimination or infectious gain of the S factor, with its autonomous or integrated multiplication...|$|R
