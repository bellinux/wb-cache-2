25|$|A {{dry suit}} {{functions}} {{by keeping the}} diver dry. The suit is waterproof and sealed so that water cannot penetrate the suit. Special purpose undergarments are usually worn under a dry suit to keep a layer of air between the diver and the suit for thermal insulation. Some divers carry an extra <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> dedicated to filling the dry suit, which may contain argon gas, {{because it is a}} better insulator than air. Dry suits should not be inflated with gases containing helium as it is a good thermal conductor.|$|E

2500|$|The kitchens in railway dining cars present special challenges: {{space is}} constrained, and, nevertheless, the {{personnel}} {{must be able}} to serve a great number of meals quickly. Especially in the early history of railways this required flawless organization of processes; in modern times, the microwave oven and prepared meals have made this task much easier. Kitchens aboard ships, aircraft and sometimes railcars are often referred to as galleys. On yachts, galleys are often cramped, with one or two burners fueled by an LP <b>gas</b> <b>bottle,</b> but kitchens on cruise ships or large warships are comparable in every respect with restaurants or canteen kitchens.|$|E
