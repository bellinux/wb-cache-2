He continued his pastoral duties until 1897, when he and Paton set up the Co-operative Holidays Association (CHA), with the aim of providing [...] "recreative and <b>educational</b> <b>holidays</b> by purchasing or renting and furnishing houses and rooms in selected centres, by catering in such houses for parties of members and guests and by securing helpers who will promote the intellectual and social interests of the party with which they are associated".|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on two {{pioneering}} organisations that were {{at the forefront of}} the provision of ‘rational’ holidays for the working-class during the early twentieth century: the Co-operative Holidays Association (CHA) and the Holiday Fellowship, founded by Thomas Arthur Leonard in 1893 and 1913 respectively. This research seeks to establish how these pioneers of recreative and <b>educational</b> <b>holidays</b> for working people dealt with the far-reaching changes in social, economic and cultural conditions during the period 1919 - 2000. It makes a significant original contribution to twentieth-century leisure and tourism history, especially that of the outdoor movement. Utilising important original source material, the research analyses the continuities and changes in these two organisations during the period 1919 - 2000 and the linkages and differences between them. The thesis explores the way the CHA and Holiday Fellowship dealt with the often conflicting demands of altruism and commercial necessity as the twentieth century progressed and assesses the extent to which they drifted away from their original ideals in order to combat the challenges of consumerism. The research takes a cultural history perspective, contextualising both organisations within a wider history of leisure, with specific reference to ‘rational’ recreation and the Victorian principles of respectability, co-operation and collectivism, and voluntarism. The research shows that the CHA and Holiday Fellowship were distinguishable from other ‘rational’ holiday providers; they had a distinct rural focus and the emphasis of their holidays was on healthy recreation and quiet enjoyment. They were almost unique in that they were equally attractive to women and men. However, both eventually served the middle classes rather than the working class for whom they were originally intended. Nevertheless, these pioneers of recreative and <b>educational</b> <b>holidays</b> unquestionably made a significant contribution to the democratisation of the countryside as a leisure space...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} the Chautauqua Assembly in {{providing}} <b>educational</b> <b>holidays</b> in North America in the final quarter {{of the nineteenth century}} raised interest {{in the development of a}} similar type of holiday in Great Britain. Following the establishment of university extension summer schools, which were themselves influenced by the example of Chautauqua, the Congregationalist social reformer John Brown Paton organised such a holiday in 1889 under the auspices of the National Home Reading Union in Blackpool, a popular seaside resort in the north of England. Adopting the values and practices of the Chautauqua Assembly, this combined informal education, non-conformist Christian morality and socially respectable leisure activities. Although not successful in establishing an English Chautauqua in Blackpool, Paton later mediated the Chautauqua ideal through his sponsorship of the Co-operative Holidays Association, a pioneer organisation in the development of rational holidays. It is argued that both the Chautauqua movement and the National Home Reading Union exercised a crucial influence on the development of rational and respectable holidays in Britain that has not previously been fully recognised...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this research is an exploration of who and what the “New Tourist ” is. Traditional “Old Tourism ” is usually associated with massed packaged holidays, typically described with the four S’s – Sun, Sea, Sand and Sex. The concept of the “New Tourist ” was first advanced by Aurelia Poon in her book Tourism, technology and competitive strategies (1993). Poon is a leading commentator on future trends in tourism and she advocated that in future tourism would be flexible, segmented, environmentally sound and diagonally integrated rather than mass, rigid, standardised and packaged. In addition, a number of authors and researchers have noted the apparent interest among tourists for <b>educational</b> <b>holidays.</b> Examples include special interest holidays, eco-tourism and cultural heritage tourism. Paradoxically, the decline in traditional churchgoing in Europe {{in recent years has}} been paralleled by, in many cases, a growing interest in religion and religious travel, as people are searching for meaning in their increasingly uncertain lives. Many people have not been able to find this through traditional forms of worship, so they are now taking to different methods in order to experience it. This includes the rediscovery of pilgrimage or journeys to so-called sacred places. Therefore the research question is whether biblical archaeological sites can be regarded as destinations for the “New Tourist”, and in future it will be expanded into how we bring these two fields of study together in order to use the opportunity for biblical archaeological tourism that has been identified but not yet been explored...|$|E

40|$|Amongst {{the varied}} work schedules, {{shiftwork}} {{is the one}} which enables organizations to extend operating hours. Shiftwork, particularly shift systems involving night work in a fixed or alternate work schedule, is associated with several disorders which, in a generic way, can be classified in three interconnected domains: i) health (e. g. circadian and sleep disturbance), ii) family and social life (e. g. conflict between parental and/or conjugal roles); iii) occupational/organizational (e. g. disturbance in performance and safety). The present study examines the possible differences between three work shifts – morning, afternoon and night – in dimensions related to health, social and family life, social support and evaluation of one's work schedule, in a particular sector of activity (textile industry). 903 workers from five textile companies participated in this study. 66 % were male workers and they were predominant in the night shift. The mean age was 39. 7 (SD= 10. 62) and the mean time working in the shift was 14. 15 years (SD= 11. 84). Besides the gender distribution, {{no differences were found}} among the three shifts. These shifts were compared according to the following variables: health (digestive and sleep problems), evaluation of shift schedule (satisfaction and intention to leave), social support (supervisor, co-workers and family) and satisfaction in the interface between the shift schedule and family or social activities. Data were collected by means of published questionnaires (e. g. Standard Shiftwork Index) and especially designed ones. When compared with the morning and the afternoon shifts, the night shift was significantly associated with higher sleep disturbance and less satisfaction with shift schedule. In its turn, the morning shift was significantly associated with less intention to leave it and with a greater satisfaction with the interface between the shift schedule and extra-organizational life. Finally, the morning shift was significantly associated to a higher perception of family support in managing the work schedule, when compared with the night shift. Results show that the night shift is the most negatively evaluated work schedule. Moreover, the payment of a shift bonus to night shift workers represents in some way that the legislator recognizes the hardship of working this shift. The bonus in that sector of activity consists of 40 % of the monthly salary. In spite of this compensation (frequently the only form of compensation offered), workers evaluated more negatively their shift schedule as they also presented greater sleep problems. Results also suggest that the night work, even if it is a fixed one (and therefore more regular from a social point of view) and it involves experienced shiftworkers, would hardly be positively evaluated when compared with other work schedules. In spite of this conclusion, the implementation of other intervention strategies (e. g. <b>educational</b> programmes, longer <b>holidays)</b> may {{have an impact on the}} work schedule evaluation...|$|R
