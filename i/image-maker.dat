500|$|Gair is {{considered}} a Trompe-l'œil body painter, but at times she describes herself more generally and colloquially as an illusionist. She also refers to herself and others refer to her as an <b>image-maker</b> for her contributions to people's perceptions of others. She was originally inspired to specialise in body painting by facial skin adornment of the indigenous Māori people of her native New Zealand. However, the glam rockers and heavy metal rockers as well as white-face geishas, Native American Indians and Indian mehndi all contributed to her inspiration. She began using Sharpies to draw on people in 1977. Her work, which became prominent with the August 1992 Vanity Fair cover of Demi Moore, has transcended various media and involved her with leading photographers, directors, super models and celebrities. Gair has worked with leading celebrities (Madonna, Cindy Crawford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Basinger, Christina Aguilera, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sophia Loren and Celine Dion) and been in editorial (Vogue, W, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, Playboy, BlackBook, and Harper's Bazaar), fashion campaigns (Donna Karan, Versace, Victoria's Secret, Guess, and bebe), cosmetic companies (L'Oréal, Maybelline, Revlon, Oil of Olay, and Rimmel) and mega-brands such as Evian. At one point she was beauty editor of Black Book. Her work with Madonna includes music videos such as Express Yourself, Vogue, Fever, Rain, Frozen, the Blonde Ambition Tour and its subsequent feature documentary [...] When Madonna teamed up with Herb Ritts for black and white photographs, Gair did the eyelashes and make-up. Gair {{has been the subject}} of numerous television programs and magazine articles, including what was the highest rated episode of Ripley's Believe It or Not?. Her first retrospective was exhibited at the Auckland Museum as part of the Vodafone Body Art exhibition in 2001 and early 2002.|$|E

That then is {{the first}} law--you must see Pallas as the Lady of Life; the second is, you must see her as the Lady of Wisdom; or [Greek: sophia]--and this is the chief matter of all. I cannot but think that, after the {{considerations}} into which we have now entered, you will find more interest than hitherto in comparing the statements of Aristotle, in the Ethics, with those of Plato in the Polity, which are authoritative as Greek definitions of goodness in art, and which you may safely hold authoritative as constant definitions of it. You remember, doubtless, that the [Greek: sophia], or [Greek: aretê pechnês], {{for the sake of}} which Phidias is called [Greek: sophos] as a sculpture, and Polyclitus as an <b>image-maker,</b> Eth. 6. 7. (the opposition is both between ideal and portrait sculpture, and between working in stone and bronze), consists in the [...] "[Greek: nous tôn timiôtatôn t ê physei]," [...] "the mental apprehension {{of the things that are}} most honorable in their nature." [...] Therefore, what is indeed most lovely, the true <b>image-maker</b> will most love; and what is most hateful, he will most hate; and in all things discern the best and strongest part of them, and represent that essentially, or, if the opposite of that, then with manifest detestation and horror. That is his art wisdom; the knowledge of good and evil, and the love of good, so that you may discern, even in his representation of the vilest thing, his acknowledgment of what redemption is possible for it, or latent power exists in it; and, contrariwise, his sense of its present misery. But, for the most part, he will idolize, and force us also to idolize, whatever is living, and virtuous, and victoriously right; opposing to it in some definite mode the image of the conquered [Greek: herpeton].|$|E

40|$|All {{kinds of}} {{travellers}} came to Bali in the 1930 s. Many of them produced books and photographs, which later incited more visitors {{to come and}} see Bali for themselves. The works of these <b>image-makers</b> who travelled to Bali are the result of actual experience and recounted journeys. Their descriptions of Bali, although based on authentic experience, are also the result of literary and pictorial readings. Their accounts or representations are often enriched with material accumulated from fiction, biblical references, and scientific books, as well as paintings and photographs. These <b>image-makers</b> of Bali did not arrive without mental luggage. Both the textual and visual <b>image-makers</b> constructed images of the paradise according to their own fantasies and personal experience, as did the consumers of those images. The representation of Balinese women was thus heavily influenced by earlier travellers, photographers, and scholars. However, {{it is difficult to know}} who imitates whom and whose images can be cited as authentic. The previous readings or visual representations condition expectations in each traveller, so that she or he fashions images inspired by those already in circulation. The themes which recur over and over in photographs confirm existing stereotypical concepts. In other words, these representations influence perceptions of the 'other' that persist to the present day. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{descriptive}} {{analysis of the}} architectural image. In it, I aim to uncover some foundational principles that architects rely upon when creating architectural images. I argue why the methods architects use to communicate architectural space in images may sometimes be lacking. Architectural animations were shown to interviewed <b>image-makers,</b> who identified three points of criticism: (1) the restless, roaming camera; (2) the marketing myths these images portray; and (3) the lifeless spaces. I investigate the architects’ reasoning for these critiqued characteristics. I show how <b>image-makers</b> handle such issues. I compare similar concepts between the disciplines of architecture and image-making. In doing so, I identify and propose new patterns for spatial portrayal that architects could use. These patterns include: (1) patterns of camera movements or stillness, (2) patterns of sequencing and editing; (3) patterns of spatial construction; (4) patterns of architectural narratives; and (5) patterns of bringing space alive. By identifying these patterns, I hope to provide {{a first step in}} improving the making of the architectural image...|$|R

40|$|After the {{political}} unification of Germany in 1990, <b>image-makers</b> and creative minds in Germany {{set to work}} {{to come to terms}} with the past. In the first months after unification, former GDR directors attempted to capture the attention of a new German audience but failed due to their use of GDR imagery and language. Following this early phase, the feature films of the next ten years revealed a predominantly negative retrospective portrayal of the GDR; <b>image-makers</b> focused almost entirely on the oppressive SED dictatorship and all its abuses of human rights. At the turn of the century, a new development occurred in the retrospective image of the GDR when Leander Haußmann’s film Sonnenallee (1999) introduced a sense of normality to the portrayal of life in the GDR; people are finally shown to have lead average lives that were not dominated by an overwhelming fear of the regime. Along with Wolfgang Becker’s award winning film Good Bye, Lenin! (2003), the films made ten years after unification mark a definite turning point in the discourse relating to the GDR in that the films not only include, but also actively propagate a sense of nostalgia about the GDR...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} epistemic {{structures}} of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century migrating <b>image-makers</b> {{with a particular}} regard for producers of sculpture. By means of an analysis of journals written by the sculptor Franz Ertinger (1669 – 1747) and the glazier Jacques-Louis Ménétra (1738 -c. 1803) this thesis identifies an epistemic order which was contingent on the worlds of mobility of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century craftsmen. In order to advance the understanding of how artisan <b>image-makers</b> of this period acquired, organised and developed knowledge, {{the concept of a}} cognitive tool-box is introduced. Examining a number of cognitive tools, i. e. epistemic strategies, the thesis constructs an interpretative framework through which itinerant artisans were potentially able to derive meanings from situations, objects and communities which were unfamiliar or culturally different in some ways. Due to the emphasis on cognitive aspects, the thesis‟s principal method can be described as an epistemological history of art, taking into consideration historically specific mechanisms of interpretation, exchange and knowledge organisation, such as the building of unwritten archives of artisan histories. The thesis also addresses questions surrounding the identities of migrating craftsmen and suggests the existence of a “Republic of Tools”, tracing the career of one of its highly mobile citizens, the sculptor Johann Eckstein (1735 - 1817) ...|$|R

Sipple's attack ads mirrored the hidden past of a vindictive man who beat his first two wives. The story was originally written for George magazine by staffer Richard Blow, then rejected by George editor-in-chief John Kennedy, Jr. under intense pressure from Sipple and advice from Kennedy’s sister Caroline. When the expose appeared in Mother Jones, Sipple responded with a $12.6 million defamation suit, but both ex-wives vouched for {{the accuracy of the}} article. Sipple appealed {{all the way up to}} the California Supreme Court, where his suit was dismissed and Sipple was forced to pay Mother Jones’ court costs.
