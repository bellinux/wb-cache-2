The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for the parking garage, and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and <b>deferrals,</b> and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At such time, they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.|$|E
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective <b>deferrals</b> were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) <b>deferrals.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Donors {{returning}} from areas with outbreaks {{of infectious diseases}} may donate infectious blood back home. Geographic donor <b>deferral</b> is an effective measure to ensure the blood safety, but donor <b>deferral</b> may pose a threat for the blood supply especially after holiday seasons. Insight into the travel behavior of blood donors {{is a first step}} to define appropriate <b>deferral</b> strategies. This study describes the travel behavior of Dutch donors, the actual <b>deferral,</b> and the consequences of <b>deferral</b> strategies on donor availability. Study Design and Methods A questionnaire designed to assess travel behavior (destination, frequency, and duration of travels) was sent to 2000 Dutch donors. The impact of travel <b>deferral</b> policies on donor availability was calculated, expressed as proportionate decrease in donor availability. The <b>deferral</b> policies considered were 1) <b>deferral</b> based on entire countries instead of affected regions where an infection is prevalent and 2) <b>deferral</b> after any travel outside Europe ("universal deferral"). Results Of the 1340 respondents, 790 (58. 9 %) donors traveled within Europe only, 61 (4. 6 %) outside Europe only, and 250 (18. 7 %) within and outside Europe. The <b>deferral</b> for entire countries and universal <b>deferral</b> would lead to 11. 1 and 11. 4 % decrease in donor availability, respectively. Conclusion Most Dutch donors traveled outside the Netherlands, while 23. 2 % traveled outside Europe. Universal <b>deferral</b> resulted in an additional decrease in donor availability of 0. 3 % compared with <b>deferral</b> for entire countries instead of affected regions where an infection is prevalent. Thus, the universal <b>deferral</b> could be considered as a simpler and safer measure...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: On November 7, 2011, the {{permanent}} <b>deferral</b> from blood donation {{of men who}} have sex with men (MSM) changed in England, Scotland and Wales, to a 12 -month <b>deferral</b> since last relevant sexual contact. This change was made following an evidence-based policy review by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO). The review concluded that the available evidence supported the introduction of a 12 -month fixed period <b>deferral</b> and that the risks associated with a 12 -month <b>deferral</b> of MSM were equivalent to a permanent <b>deferral.</b> The permanent <b>deferral</b> for MSM was introduced in 1985 in response to the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV. The change was supported by new data on the level of compliance with {{the permanent}} <b>deferral,</b> advances in the testing and processing of donated blood, changes in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and improved scientific knowledge. This review discusses how the decision to change the <b>deferral</b> period was reached and highlights some of the remaining issues relating to this contentious matter...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the rates and reasons for donor <b>deferral.</b> DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study at Shiraz Blood Transfusion Center, Shiraz, Iran. METHODS: 141, 820 volunteers were interviewed confidentially by physicians before blood donation. The rate of and reasons for donor <b>deferral</b> were investigated according to demographic characteristics. The data were analyzed using the comparison-of-proportions test of the MedCalc statistical software. RESULTS: 43, 839 people (30. 9 %) who had come for blood donation were deferred, 1, 973 (4. 5 %) of them permanently. The <b>deferral</b> rate was significantly higher among women, single individuals and first-time donors, compared with men, married individuals and those with a history of previous donation (P < 0. 0001). The <b>deferral</b> rate was significantly higher in the 17 to 30 -year-old group (P < 0. 05). The reasons for <b>deferral</b> were divided into five categories: risk factors possibly related to HIV or hepatitis (43. 6 %), underlying diseases (31. 9 %), non-eligible conditions (13. 5 %), medications that interfere with blood donation (7. 8 %) and risk factors that may relate to bacterial or viral infections except HIV and hepatitis infections (3. 2 %).

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 donors in the two weeks following a temporary <b>deferral</b> due to a low haemoglobin concentration. The Framework approach was used to analyse data and identify themes associated with prompt return, ascertained from Blood Service records.
