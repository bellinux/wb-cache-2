[...] Aaliyah's mother Diane Haughton reflected that everything [...] "that went wrong in her life" [...] began with her relationship with R. Kelly.

2500|$|He has an {{interest}} in nice restrooms and his personal bathroom habits border on obsession. In [...] "The Revenge", he quits his real estate job solely because he's forbidden to use his boss' private bathroom. In [...] "The Voice", he admits {{that one of the reasons}} he's staying at a job his boss has asked that he resign from (for feigning a disability) is that it gives him [...] "private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city". In [...] "The Busboy", he claims to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the locations of the best public bathrooms in the city. He proves this in [...] "The Bizarro Jerry" [...] when he directs Kramer to [...] "the best bathroom in midtown" [...] at the offices of Brand/Leland, even describing the layout, marble, high ceiling and toilets that flush [...] "like a jet engine". [...] In [...] "The Gymnast", he told Jerry that he always removes his shirt when using the bathroom because [...] "it frees me up... no encumbrances". It's unclear if he dropped this habit after an embarrassing incident where he walked out of a bathroom shirtless at a lunch party attended by his girlfriend, <b>her</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> other female members of her family. When working for the Yankees, he suggested having the bathroom stall doors stretched all the way to the ground (letting people's legs not be seen while in the stalls), and, in many episodes, he shows a fascination with toilet paper and its history. He also displays a fear of diseases, like lupus and cancer. In [...] "The Wife", George gets into trouble for peeing in the shower at a gym but defends his action with, [...] "It's all pipes! What's the difference?" [...] even threatening to call a plumber to back him up.|$|E
