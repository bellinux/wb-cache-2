40|$|Birds on {{migration}} {{alternate between}} consuming fuel stores during flights and accumulating fuel stores during stopovers. The optimal timing {{and length of}} flights and stopovers for successful migration depend heavily on the extra metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> (fuel use) required to carry the fuel stores during flight(1, 2). The effect of large fuel loads on metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> has never been empirically determined. We measured the total metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> of a long-distance migrant, the red knot (Calidris canutus), flying for 6 to 10 h in a wind tunnel, using the doubly labelled water technique(3). Here we show that total metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> increased with fuel load, but proportionally less than the predicted mechanical power output from the flight muscles. The most likely {{explanation is that the}} efficiency with which metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> is converted into mechanical output by the flight muscles increases with fuel load. This will influence current models of bird flight and bird migration. It may also help to explain why some shorebirds, despite the high metabolic <b>power</b> <b>input</b> required to fly, routinely make nonstop flights of 4, 000 km longer(4) ...|$|R
30|$|Further, lower {{shear stress}} value with shear rate (Fig.  2) was also {{observed}} in bitumen sonicated under different frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>inputs.</b> The decreased viscosity and shear stress in bitumen sonicated under different conditions of sonication frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> indicated shear-thinning (pseudo-plastic) behavior of bitumen under sonolysis.

The lower viscosity and shear stress with respect to shear rate observed in frequency condition of 574  kHz with 50  % <b>power</b> <b>input</b> was due to higher formation of hydroxyl radicals and disintegration of asphaltene flocs.|$|R
40|$|The wind <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to {{the ocean}} general {{circulation}} is usually calculated from the time-averaged wind products. Here, this wind <b>power</b> <b>input</b> is reexamined using available observations, focusing {{on the role of}} the synoptically varying wind. <b>Power</b> <b>input</b> {{to the ocean}} general circulation is found to increase by over 70 % when 6 -hourly winds are used instead of monthly winds. Much of the increase occurs in the storm-track regions of the Southern Ocean, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Extension. This result holds irrespective of whether the ocean surface velocity is accounted for in the wind stress calculation. Depending on the fate of the highfrequency wind <b>power</b> <b>input,</b> the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the ocean general circulation relevant to deep-ocean mixing may be less than previously thought.

40|$|The {{friction}} stir {{welding procedure}} to seal copper canisters requires variable <b>power</b> <b>input</b> throughout the 45 minute long weld cycle to keep the welding temperature within the process window. This is due to variable thermal boundary conditions throughout the weld cycle which, together with fast disturbances in the spindle torque, requires control of both the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> and the welding temperature to achieve a stable and robust process. By using a cascaded loop that determines the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> requirement, the regulator will not be dependent on repeatability in the necessary <b>power</b> <b>input</b> between weld cycles. As a result, a more accurate and reliable closed-loop control of the welding temperature is acquired...|$|R
30|$|The {{viscosity}} {{change in}} bitumen for different sonication frequencies with different <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> {{is presented in}} Fig.  6. The major viscosity changes were observed to occur at sonication frequencies of 378 and 574  kHz with increasing <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> The highest viscosity change of 38 % was observed at a sonication frequency of 574  kHz with 83.33 % <b>power</b> <b>input,</b> and lowest viscosity changes (5 %) were observed at sonication frequency of 1173  kHz with a <b>power</b> <b>input</b> of 83.33 %. However, {{it was observed that}} the change in viscosity increases in all the five sonication frequency conditions tested with increasing <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> The increase in viscosity change (lower viscosity) with increasing the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> was due to higher disintegration of asphaltene flocs. Higher cavitation yield causes more acoustic cavitation in the medium, which then causes floc disintegration and cell breakage, leading to release of intracellular materials to the aqueous phase. Cavitation yield during different sonication frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>input</b> conditions is a result of a series of energy conversions (electrical energy → mechanical energy → acoustic energy → cavitation energy) that occur in the ultrasonic processor. In case of varying frequencies, such chain of energy conversion strongly depends on the total bubble volume fraction in the medium which further depends on the number of bubbles and their size distribution (Moholkar and Warmoeskerken 2003).|$|R

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{agglomeration}} {{tests were conducted}} {{as part of an}} effort to find a suitable basis for size scale-up of the mixing system used for a gas-promoted oil agglomeration process. In the first series of tests the agitator impeller diameter and speed were varied among runs so as to vary impeller tip speed and agitator power independently while keeping other conditions constant. In the second series of tests the mixing tank size and agitator speed were varied while the ratio of tank diameter to impeller diameter were held constant. All tests were conducted with finely ground Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and with i-octane as the agglomerant. The results of these tests showed that the minimum time te required to produce spherical agglomerates was predominantly a function of the agitator <b>power</b> <b>input</b> per unit volume. In addition, the size of the agglomerates produced in a given time was also strongly dependent on <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> At lower <b>power</b> <b>input</b> levels, the mean size rose as <b>power</b> <b>input</b> increased until a point was reached where agglomerate breakage became important and the mean size decreased.

40|$|Two {{electrode}} configurations {{were tested}} in an electric-arc wind tunnel at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The results indicated approximately the same heat-loss rate per unit of arc <b>power</b> <b>input</b> {{for each of the}} configurations. Measured heat-loss rates were on the order of 40 percent of the arc <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> Nearly all this loss occurred at the anode. The <b>power</b> <b>input</b> and arc current limitations of the electrodes appear to be the critical design factors. Up to now, the maximum power to the stream has been 115 kilowatts with a cooled tungsten cathode and a cooled cylindrical anode incorporating a magnetic field. The maximum <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to this anode could not be established with the cooled tungsten cathode because cathode failures occurred at a gross power level of approximately 175 kilowatts. It was necessary to use a graphite cathode to seek the limitation of the anode.

40|$|Thermal flying-height control (TFC) sliders {{have been}} used for active flying height control of hard disk drives. It is of {{particular}} interest to investigate if TFC sliders can be used to minimize both repeatable and nonrepeatable flying height variations. To that end, the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the heater must be dynamically optimized at each time step in order to minimize changes in flying height. In the current study, a numerical procedure is implemented to simulate the time dependent response of a TFC slider to changes of the heater element <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> The dynamic Reynolds equation and slider equilibrium equations are solved simultaneously to determine the dynamic change in flying height as a function of time.
