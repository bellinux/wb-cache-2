This method was applied to comparing two different stereoscopic 3 D-TV technologies, one autostereoscopic and one with active shutter glasses. The report describes the preparations done, environments used, the collection of data and how it was analyzed. Furthermore, the 3 D-TV technologies that have been used in this test will also be covered, as well as the 3 D material and how it was produced. In addition the possible ways of distributing 3 D material in a data network perspective, will also be described...|$|R

We assigned the other subscales to the test-related facets (test attractiveness, usefulness of the test) and to the person-related facets (emotional state, worry, distraction) of test-taking motivation.|$|R
