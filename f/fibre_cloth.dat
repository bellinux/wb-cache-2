40|$|Multifunctional {{composites}} {{have attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention as they offer a way to cut down the parasitic weight in vehicles which not only reduces the operational costs but also reduces the fuel consumption in vehicles. Current engineering design is increasingly sophisticated, requiring more efficient material utilisation; sub-system mass and volume are crucial application determinants. This dissertation contributes to the fabrication of composites that can store electrical energy and are known as structural supercapacitors. The key in the fabrication of structural supercapacitors was not simply to bind two disparate components together, but to produce a single coherent material that inherently performed both roles of a structural composite and a supercapacitor. This design approach is at a relatively early stage, and faces significant design and material synthesis challenges. Disparate material requirements, such as structural and electrochemical properties, have to be engineered and optimised simultaneously. This study investigates on structural supercapacitors fabricated by using as-received as well as activated carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloths</b> as reinforcement and electrodes; multifunctional resin as electrolyte and matrix; and glass <b>fibre</b> <b>cloths,</b> filter papers or polymer membranes as insulators. Such a system should deliver electrical energy storage capacity as well as bear mechanical loads. Different liquid electrolytes, such as ionic liquids and salts based on Li+ and NH 4 +, were studied in order to optimise the multifunctionality of polymer electrolyte. Mesoporous silica particles were also introduced into polymer electrolytes in order to enhance the mechanical and electrochemical performance of polymer electrolytes. Nanostructured/ multifunctional resin blends were cured in cylindrical form and were examined by compression testing as well as impedance spectroscopy. An ionic conductivity of 0. 8 mS/cm and a compression modulus of 62 MPa have been synthesised for the polymer electrolyte in the current study. By varying the separators, multifunctional resins and the electrodes, different structural supercapacitor configurations were manufactured using a resin infusion under flexible tooling (RIFT) method and were characterised to study the electrochemical performance by using charge/discharge method and mechanical performance by using ± 45 ° laminate shear testing. The improved structural supercapacitors showed an energy density of 0. 1 Wh/kg, a power density of 36 W/kg and a shear modulus of 1. 7 GPa.

The Co 3 O 4 hybrid structure on CFC showed interesting electrochemical performance in both alkaline and organic electrolytes when used as electrodes for symmetric supercapacitors. Compared to conventional alkaline electrolytes, the fabricated symmetric cell in organic electrolyte has delivered {{a high rate}} and cyclic performance. A supercapacitor made from this hierarchical hybrid architecture showed a maximum specific capacitance of 4. 8 mF cm- 2 at a constant density of 3 mA cm- 2 in organic electrolyte. In terms of energy and power, the symmetric supercapacitor conveyed an energy density of 4. 2 mW h cm- 3 with a power density of 1260 mW cm- 3. Also, the device exhibited reasonable tolerance for mechanical deformation under bended conditions demonstrating {{the flexibility of the}} materials. The impressive electrochemical activity is mainly attributed to their high surface area (60. 3 m 2 g- 1) resulting from their nano/mesoporous structure; reasonable electrical conductivity resulted from binder-free and intimate metal oxide/substrate integration and superior flexibility of the carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloth.</b> Thereby, it was concluded that the direct growth of the Co 3 O 4 nanostructure on CFC is a promising electrode for the advanced flexible energy storage devices regardless of the electrolyte...|$|E

However, the sluggish kinetic rates of the ammonia electrooxidation reaction, and high cost and poisoning of Pt-based catalysts still remain challenges.

In this work, we directly grew hierarchical mixed NiCu layered hydroxides (LHs) nanowires on carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloth</b> electrodes by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method for efficient electro-oxidation of ammonia. This catalyst achieves a current density of 35 mA cm− 2 at 0. 55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which {{is much higher than}} that of bare Ni(OH) 2 catalyst (5 mA cm− 2). This is due to abundant active sites and a synergistic effect between Ni and Cu, possibly due to the formation of Ni 1 −xCuxOOH {{on the surface of the}} catalysts through the electrochemical activation of the mixture of Cu(OH) 2 and α-Ni(OH) 2. In the investigated first row transition elements, it is found that Cu is the sole first-row transition metal to effectively improve activity of Ni(OH) 2 for ammonia electrooxidation. This mixed NiCu LHs nano-wire catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/C catalyst in the aspects of ammonia oxidation current and stability, demonstrating it to be a promising low-cost and stable catalyst for efficient ammonia electrooxidation in alkaline condition, which is a potential electrode for ammonia fuel cells for power generation or electrolysis of ammonia for ammonia-containing wastewater treatment. ...|$|E

40|$|Stability of anaeobic digesters is {{important}} for efficient and effective treatment of sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants. One of the factors governing the process stability of anaerobic digesters is the balance between the microbial groups involved in the digestion process, particularly between acid producers (bacteria) and acid consumers (archaea). It has been frequently observed that changes in the environmental conditions or feed composition disturb the balance between acid producing bacteria and acid consuming methanogenic archaea causing accumulation of intermediate products which leads to digester failure. Maintaining the balance between the microbial communities is even more challenging at thermophilic temperatures possibly due to the lower microbial diversity reported at higher temperatures. Studies on many macro-organisms in large scale ecosystems and a few on microbial ecosystems suggest that highly diverse ecosystems are more resilient towards disturbances and hence are functionally more stable. In the current study, {{it was hypothesized that}} increasing the microbial diversity in thermophilic anaerobic digesters (TADs) will make the digesters more resilient towards sudden changes in the feed composition and hence increases the process stability of the digesters. Two different approaches were adopted to increase the microbial diversity in the TADs. In the first approach diversity was increased at the micro-organism level i. e. increasing the species diversity of the methanogens. Three different methods were used to increase the diversity of methanogens such as using inocula from range of environments, changing the method of mixing and using support media in the digesters. In the second approach microbial diversity was increased at the functional group level by introducing a completely new functional group of micro-organisms i. e. the anodophiles (electrogenic bacteria), which are not found in anaerobic digesters naturally but which are in many ways capable of replacing the function of the methanogens in the anaerobic microbial community. No increase in methanogen diversity was observed when inocula from range of environments was used. Based on 16 S rRNA gene analysis, the methanogens dominating the sewage sludge were found to be dominant in the tested and control samples. The species diversity of methanogens was successfully increased by changing the method of mixing from mechanical stirrer to sludge re-circulation. The dominant methanogens in the digesters using sludge re-circulation for mixing were closely related to thermophilic archaea such as Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus, Methanobacterium thermoformicicum, Methanosarcina thermophila, whereas the dominant methanogens in the mechanically stirred digesters were closely related to Methanosaeta concilli, uncultured Methanosaeta sp and Methanosarcina barkeri. The sludge re-circulation mixing method promoted proliferation of true thermophilic micro-organisms and may also have helped to maintain close syntrophic associations. An inert carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloth</b> (CFC) was also tried in the digesters to increase the diversity of methanogens. The digesters with CFCs recovered at faster rates than the digesters without CFCs. The 16 S rRNA gene analysis on the adhering fraction of CFCs and suspended fraction from the digester showed higher diversity of methanogens on CFCs. The use of CFCs also increased the average residence time of micro-organisms in the digesters and facilitate the maintenance of close syntrophic associations of syntrophic micro-organisms. To add an entire functional group of micro-organisms to the digesters, microbial fuel cells were combined with the TADs. The anaerobic digester/ microbial fuel cell hybrid system was tested for increased stability by giving acetic acid shock to the system. The hybrid system recovered at a faster rate after the acid shock compared with either of the components of the hybrid system when operated individually. The results from this study suggested that diversity-stability ecological theories can be applied to engineer new digester designs to promote digester stability and performance in the event of environmental and/or operational disturbances. It must be emphasized that the techniques used to measure the microbial diversity of TADs in the current study were limited to measuring the diversity of only dominant micro-organisms. In this work implications for operating a thermophilic anaerobic digester with lipid rich waste are outlined...|$|E
