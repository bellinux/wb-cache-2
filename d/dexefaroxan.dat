40|$|Activation of the {{recombinant}} human α 2 C-adrenoceptor (α 2 C AR) by (−) -adrenaline in CHO-K 1 cells transiently co-expressing a chimeric Gαq/i 1 protein induced a rapid, transient Ca 2 + response with a high-magnitude {{followed by a}} low-magnitude phase which continued throughout the recorded time period (15 [*]min). Activation of the α 2 C AR by various α 2 AR agonists revealed the following rank order of high-magnitude Ca 2 + response [Emax (%) versus 10 [*]μM (−) -adrenaline]: UK 14304 (102 ± 4) =talipexole (101 ± 3) =(−) -adrenaline (100) =d-medetomidine (98 ± 1) >oxymetazoline (81 ± 4) ⋍clonidine (75 ± 5). The methoxy- (RX 821002) and ethoxy-derivatives (RX 811059) of idazoxan and the <b>dexefaroxan</b> analogue atipamezole were fully effective as antagonists of both the high- and the low-magnitude Ca 2 + response. However, though acting as full antagonists of the high-magnitude response, the further putative α 2 AR antagonists idazoxan (27 %), SKF 86466 (29 %) and <b>dexefaroxan</b> (59 %) reversed the low-magnitude response only partially. In conclusion, kinetic analyses of agonist[*]:[*]antagonist interactions at the α 2 C AR demonstrate {{a wide spectrum of}} partial to complete antagonism of the low-magnitude Ca 2 + response for structurally related α 2 AR ligands...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of pharmacological modulations of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system on odor recognition in the mouse. Mice exposed to a nonrewarded olfactory stimulation (training) were able to memorize this odor and to discriminate it from a new odor in a recall test performed 15 min later. At longer delays (30 or 60 min), the familiar odor was no longer retained, and both stimuli were perceived as new ones. Following a post-training injection of the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>dexefaroxan,</b> the familiar odor was still remembered 30 min after training. In contrast, both the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 and the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP- 4 prevented {{the recognition of the}} familiar odor 15 min after the first exposure. Noradrenaline release in the olfactory bulb, assessed by measurement of the extracellular noradrenaline metabolite normetanephrine, was increased by 62 % following <b>dexefaroxan</b> injection, and was decreased by 38 %– 44 % after treatment with UK 14304 and DSP- 4. Performance of mice in the recall test was reduced by a post-training injection of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or the α 1 -antagonist prazosin, thus implicating a role for β- and α 1 -adrenoceptors in the facilitating effects of noradrenaline on short-term olfactory recognition in this model...|$|E
40|$|Whereas agonist-directed {{differential}} signaling at {{a single}} receptor subtype has become an accepted pharmacological concept, dis-tinct behaviors by ligands that {{are assumed to be}} antagonists is less documented. The intrinsic activity and capacity of antago-nism for a new series of imidazoline-derived adrenergic ligands analogous to <b>dexefaroxan</b> were investigated by measuring two distinct signaling pathways at the recombinant human 2 A-adrenoceptor (2 A AR) : 1) pertussis toxin-resistant guanosine 5 -O-(3 -[35 S]thio) triphosphate ([35 S]GTPS) binding responses medi-ated by either a recombinant GoCys 351 Ile or Gi 2 Cys 352 Ile protein in CHO-K 1 cells, and 2) inhibition of cAMP formation in a stably transfected C 6 -glial cell line. Ligands could be differentiated as inverse agonists [i. e., 2 -(4 -methoxy- 2 -ethyl- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofu-ran- 2 -yl) - 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazole; RX 851062], neutral antago...|$|E
40|$|Replacement of a {{threonine}} by a lysine {{at position}} 373 in the C-terminal {{portion of the}} third intracellular loop of the human α 2 A-adrenergic receptor (α 2 A AR) {{has been reported to}} generate a constitutively active mutant receptor in analogy with similar mutations in the α 1 B and β 2 AR (Ren et al., 1993). In the present study, the mutant Thr 373 Lys α 2 A AR receptor was investigated by measuring the formation of inositol phosphates in either the absence or presence of mouse Gα 15 protein in Cos- 7 cells. Increased affinity, potency and/or efficacy for the agonists [(−) -adrenaline, UK 14304, clonidine, guanabenz and oxymetazoline] was observed, consistent with a precoupled mutant α 2 A AR: G-protein state. The basal inositol phosphates response was similar at the wild-type (wt) and mutant α 2 A AR, but was enhanced at the mutant α 2 A AR upon co-expression with the mouse Gα 15 protein. This enhanced response could not be attenuated in the presence of any of the tested α 2 AR antagonists (10 [*]μM), suggesting that inverse agonist activity did not occur at the mutant α 2 A AR. Ligands that so far have been identified as antagonists at the wt α 2 A AR demonstrated either no intrinsic activity (MK 912, WB 4101, RS 15385, RX 811059 and RX 821002) or positive efficacy [Emax, % vs. 1 [*]μM UK 14304 : <b>dexefaroxan</b> (27 ± 7), idazoxan (34 ± 9), atipamezole (27 ± 4), BRL 44408 (59 ± 5) and SKF 86466 (54 ± 9) ] at the mutant α 2 A AR, but only {{in the presence of the}} mouse Gα 15 protein. The ligand potencies corresponded with their respective pKi values at the mutant α 2 A AR receptor. The partial agonist effect of SKF 86466 was resistant to pertussis toxin treatment (100 [*]ng[*]ml− 1) and not affected by co-expression of the rat Gαi 1 protein. It was virtually absent in the presence of 10 [*]μM RS 15385. SKF 86466 was without intrinsic activity upon co-expression of the mouse Gαq protein. Some putative α 2 AR antagonists exerted a partial agonist activity that was highly dependent on the presence of specific G-protein α-subunits, suggesting that these ligands cause selective G-protein activation at the mutant α 2 A AR...|$|E
