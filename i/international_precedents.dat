Scholars tend to agree that the plan is, at best, questionable under Israeli law. Currently, there is no Israeli law which would deal with this issue. In order for it to be implemented, the Knesset would have to enact legislation, and the High Court of Justice would rule on its legality. It is unlikely that either International or Israeli law would allow revocation of citizenship without a bilateral agreement with the Palestinian Authority.|$|E

It was also the result of shifts in thinking about the Treaty of Waitangi. By the mid-1980s, the treaty had acquired increased relevance thanks primarily to the Waitangi Tribunal. The act was passed at least in part as a response to Waitangi Tribunal finding that the Māori language was a taonga (treasure or valued possession) under the Treaty of Waitangi. [...] The act also drew on a number of <b>international</b> <b>precedents,</b> primarily the Irish Bord Na Gaeilge Act 1978, which is cited several times in the legislation but also the United Kingdom's Welsh Language Act 1967, which enabled the use of the Welsh language in Welsh court proceedings.|$|E

Ugarteche {{is the founder of}} the Homosexual Movement of Lima, a Peruvian LGBT advocacy group that was founded in 1982. The court ruled that not recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other countries would be highly discriminatory and contrary to both the Peruvian Constitution and many international provisions. The court found that the only reason upon which the marriage was not recognized was because it was concluded between persons of the same sex, and that argument is not reasonable and objective. Additionally, it cited many <b>international</b> <b>precedents,</b> including Atala Riffo and Daughters v. Chile and Obergefell v. Hodges.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{analyses}} {{the genesis}} and recent {{evolution of the}} Pan-African Parliament (PAP), {{one of the key}} institutions of African integration. Based on theories relating to the European Parliament, it argues that the dynamics surrounding the establishment of the PAP result from a blend of internal and external factors. On the one hand, the decision to create a PAP {{can be traced back to}} the problems of the Organisation of African Unity and to the will of African leaders to revive Pan-Africanism. On the other hand, the establishment and design of the PAP are partially inspired by <b>international</b> <b>precedents</b> such as the European Parliament. Over and above this observation, which is informed by the theory of mimetic institutionalism, the existence of regular interactions between Europe and Africa and, more generally, the outward activities of the PAP, would seem propitious to the self-assertion of this institution. Ultimately, the objective of the article is to lay the ground for a more ambitious theory of regional parliamentary assemblies...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{objectives}} of contemporary urban design is {{to ensure the quality}} and activity within urban public spaces. Presented as a progressively emerging paradigm in this process, the effects of urban climatology are increasingly elucidating the need for further climate responsive environments. Moreover, this interest is one that shall increase along with the progression of climate change effects upon outdoor environments. Nevertheless, it is often that climatic assessments lack bottom-up climatic indicators, tools and practical benchmarks. As a result, this obstructs local decision making, and practices of localised adaptive design. In an effort to address such discrepancies, this paper launches a framework of <b>international</b> <b>precedents</b> of built and conceptual projects that address thermal comfort levels in public spaces. This organisation will be cross-referenced with theory that supports its structure and typological division. With Auckland as the focal case study, the solutions that are extracted from the framework will be scrutinised in order to shape new potential measures, and launch new considerations in Auckland’s local policy and design guidelines. In this way, microclimatic concerns are hence framed into an opportunity to potentiate the use and longevity of Auckland’s public realm...|$|E

40|$|Having reaped {{some success}} in liberalising telecommunications, {{electricity}} utilities and air transport, the European Commission is now taking market economy-focused steps in the sector of public short-distance and regional passenger transport services. In a current draft regulation, it proposes that licences be granted in a transparent public tender procedure. Through the use of "controlled competition" that encompasses exclusivity rights limited by geography and time, both the profitability and quality of public passenger transport are to be improved, which in turn heightens its attractiveness over private motorised transport and its attendant environmental problems. <b>International</b> <b>precedents</b> have shown that competitive bidding produces the best results when compared to full-scale market liberalisation or state provision of public passenger transport. All countries which have so far tendered transport services have seen cost cuts, improved services and a reduction of public subsidies.

The studio used design-research to explore options for elevated rail along the Upfield line.

40|$|Objective At present, Singapore health {{authorities}} are deliberating nutrition labeling and regulations to reduce trans-fat {{in the food}} supply. This paper reviews the case for enacting nutrition policies to reduce population trans-fat intake in Singapore. It further proposes a decision-making framework that may inform other jurisdictions in assessing the merits of nutrition policies. Review framework This case study reviews the necessity of interventions to reduce trans-fat intake, appropriateness of a policy-based approach, and feasibility of trans-fat policies in the Singapore context. Evidence is drawn from national health reports, measures of stakeholder support, resources for implementing these policies, and results from <b>international</b> <b>precedents.</b> Results The burden of cardiovascular disease and excessive intake of trans-fat in the adult population warrant consideration of interventions to reduce excessive trans-fat intake. Labeling of trans-fat content and regulating usage of trans-fat in the food supply may be effective and feasible in the Singapore context. Stakeholder support for these policies was present {{from members of the}} public and health agencies. Conclusion Policy approaches to reduce trans-fat intake and cardiovascular disease risk in Singapore should be considered. The proposed nutrition policy decision framework may guide health agencies in assessing the appropriateness of trans-fat or other nutrition policies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Throughout {{the past decade}} of wars, the U. S. has deployed unmanned aerial systems, {{commonly referred to as}} drones, from Africa to Asia collecting intelligence and targeting adversaries. The nation now stands at a crossroad seeking to develop future American drone policy against an evolving threat {{while at the same time}} shaping global norms. The past decade of American drone use focused on short-term benefits, intelligence collection and lethal targeting, rather than on the long-term consequences of technology diffusion, or ethical and legal frameworks. Myopic drone strategies threaten to establish a global precedent that could undermine the stability of international relations, as state and non-state actors (SANSA) have begun to build, arm, and operate lethal unmanned systems at an alarming rate. Unmanned technology development and usage is outpacing international norms, regulations, and policies. These systems will usher in an era of unrestricted drone usage unless international regulations and standards are developed. This thesis examines whether American drone strategy is myopic and whether it is creating a dangerous <b>international</b> <b>precedent.</b> A qualitative analysis will identify the short-term benefits and long-term consequences of U. S. drone strategy, focusing on unmanned technology diffusion, ethical justifications, and legal frameworks. Examining American drone strategy can help explain why a myopic policy may be beneficial in the short-term, yet may increase threats to national interests in the long-term. The thesis concludes with an assessment of whether strategic myopia has already set a dangerous <b>international</b> <b>precedent,</b> which SANSA will use to justify their future drone programs.
