5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E

40|$|The <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> {{represent}} a comprehensive and standardized document including financial {{information about the}} company. The companies need to publish this document in the Collection of Deeds, and since the documents are submitted to the Collection of Deeds in electronic form and are subsequently freely available, any <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> are generally available {{to a wide range}} of potential users. Users of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> can be divided based on their relation to the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and based on level of their knowledge of accounting. The confidence of users in information disclosed in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> is higher, in case the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> were subject to audit. The user of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> does not have a possibility of detailed verification of the information presented in it (he cannot inquire the management of the company, inspect the original accounting documents, etc.). In this case, the audit represents ensuring correctness of the information presented in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and also assurance that the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> were subject to the independent verification. These facts enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and this is also the purpose of an audit as defined by the International Standards on Auditing. In accordance with the International Standards on Auditing the auditor expects that the user of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> has reasonable knowledge of accounting and is willing to study the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> with reasonable effort. Auditor performs his testing based on certain materiality level that does not have to agree to the materiality level of the user. The risk represents in this case the situation, when the materiality level of the user is lower than the materiality level determined by the auditor. The user of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> has limited possibilities to verify the information in it, however, he is able to verify the link among information presented in different parts of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and confront the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> with other relevant information available. My dissertation consists from theoretical and practical part. In the theoretical part, there are possible verifications described that can be performed by the user of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and in the practical part, there are the mentioned procedures applied to <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of four domestic companies. The subject of my research was <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> for the years 2006 to 2009. The aim was not only the identification of the risks in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> from the users' point of view, but also monitoring of the development of <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> in time. The subject of the dissertation was also the verification of the formal correctness of audit reports issued to the selected <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> (I am registered as Czech statutory auditor by the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic and therefore I am able to perform this verification). The subject of the dissertation was not the verification of the factual correctness of the audit report, this verification is in principle not possible without possibility to look into the audit file. During analysis of selected <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> I have identified several areas that represent risk of misstatement in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> from the users' point of view. It related mainly to going concern issues, issues relating to completeness of reserves and provisions and risk of possible overvaluation of finance investments and related receivables to subsidiaries. The user of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> should for his better understanding therefore look for other information relating to the company from freely available resources and perform comparison with <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of other companies in the same industry. The risks mentioned above were not sufficiently commented in the notes to the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and that subsequently gives a rise to questions on <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> users' side and lowers his confidence in information presented in the <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> I think that there is a change in the audit approach necessary, it should not be enough just that the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> are free from material misstatement; the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> should not give a rise to additional questions from their users...|$|R
