40|$|Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) {{are a new}} {{instrument}} {{in the fight against}} serious transnational crime. The European legal framework and the national implementation of this instrument give rise to several (legal) questions. An analysis of the (European) legal framework on JITs uncovers the particularities regarding the <b>dual</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for establishing a JIT and the consequences of deficient and unclear national implementing laws. The implications of the Pupino case with regard to the Framework Decision on JITs cannot be denied, as was confirmed by the Dutch courts in the first JIT case ever brought before them. However, practice shows that a legal framework is not enough to ensure the successful application of the JIT instrument. Based on two case studies, insight is provided into the obstacles to establishing a JIT and into available remedies...|$|E
40|$|Present work {{focuses on}} the {{non-intervention}} principle and low-intensity cyber operations. More specifically, its main question is, whether the principle of non-intervention applies to low-intensity cyber operations and if it does, is the legal framework of non-intervention principle {{an effective way to}} regulate peacetime low-intensity cyber operations. Information Age and the rapid development of ICTs have provided hostile actors the opportunity to exploit the advantages cyberspace offers. Fear for the largely unknown has fostered a rich academic debate around the applicability of the use of force and LOAC. Yet, all of the information operations we have seen thus far have remained under the Article 2 (4) threshold and that will most likely be the trend also in the future. Low-intensity cyber operations, meaning those that do not produce any damage or the damage caused is insignificant, can affect severely the everyday functioning of a heavily technology dependent State. They are inexpensive, easy to deploy, effective and can be used during peacetime with the added benefit of attacker anonymity. Thus, understanding the international law framework covering such operations is of outmost importance. The thesis first looks at the concept of sovereignty in relation to cyberspace, since the non-intervention principle derives from the notion of sovereignty. Due to cyberspace’s intangible nature, two main misconceptions have arisen. Firstly, cyberspace is often mistakenly found {{to be part of the}} global commons. Secondly, cyberspace is often seen as a domain, where States cannot assert their authority. Whilst addressing those two misconceptions, it is concluded that neither of those arguments is particularly true. States can exercise sovereignty and assert authority over the information infrastructure located in their territory. Theoretical framework of the non-intervention principle sets forth that the principle has a <b>dual</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> Grounded on the one hand in treaty law and on the other hand customary international law, the principle was most clearly delineated by the UN from 1960 s to 1980 s. Generally, the non-intervention principle is said to consist of two elements: coercion and intervention that affects the internal or external affairs of the State. It is established that the nature of coercion has changed over time. That is also what this present work is grounded in. Cyber operations represent the next step in the evolution of States’ interventionist means. Whilst applying the international law framework of non-intervention principle to low-intensity cyber operations it becomes clear that the standards applied within the framework are too high to effectively regulate such offensive operations. The scope of States’ margin of appreciation regarding domaine réservé has been significantly reduced and the level of coercion needed to effectively apply the non-intervention principle does not correspond to today’s security environment. States are increasingly using cyber operations to achieve their strategic goals. From Estonia in 2007 to Sony in 2014 the interventionist means of States have grown to be less intensive, yet more penetrating, long-term and effective. A vivid example is cyber espionage, which is often disregarded in the discourse as a matter that is already resolved. Yet, as the cyber means grow more effective, cyber espionage through low-intensity cyber operations becomes more penetrative and the line between violation of sovereignty and non-intervention principle becomes clouded. In order for a cyber operation to breach the non-intervention principle, it must have a coercive nature and not be categorised as mere intrusion. The examples of State-on-State cyber operations show that none of the known cyber attacks has crossed the UN Charter Article 2 (4) threshold. Instead they could be seen as unlawful interventions if extensive interpretation is applied. That leads to the second question of the present work: is the non-intervention principle effective in tackling the low-intensity cyber operations? Whereas the framework of the non-intervention principle is valid and relevant, the standards applied therein, developed close to three decades ago, do not adequately consider the changed security landscape of the 21 st century. While the security threats become more penetrative and invasive, yet the interventionist means become low-intensity, the international community must look for feasible solutions for the technology future to come...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{generally}} known facts in litigation with review on some viewpoints accepted in Austrian, German and Croatian jurisprudence and legal practice on this topic. First starting theoretical viewpoint in this research is that the establishment of facts by rules on {{generally known facts}} is one of methods for establishment of facts. Regular method for establishment of facts is proving, but it has subordinate nature. Other methods for establishment of facts are application of rules on recognition, on legal presumptions and on burden of proof. Second starting theoretical viewpoint is that the law on establishment of facts has <b>dual</b> <b>legal</b> nature: it has legal protective and procedural aspect. Author discusses on various problems with regard to notion, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and characteristics of generally known facts and on implementation of rules on their establishment in litigation...|$|R

The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R
