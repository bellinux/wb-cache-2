5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed <b>in</b> <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order.</b> For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear <b>in</b> <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order,</b> but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E

The lists are <b>in</b> <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order</b> and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

The Presidency was held by each state {{for a period of}} three months, rotating between them <b>in</b> <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order.</b> One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority. Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.|$|E
