5|$|In 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV {{software}} was introduced {{with a new}} user-interface, an integrated TV guide from TitanTV and compatibility with Apple remotes. The interface {{was similar to that}} of other Apple products. An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to find its targets had vanished from coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. It took some skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and sonobuoy. These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Dean {{turned to the}} north, and became embedded within a large mid-level trough off the East Coast of the United States. Convection increased around the system early on August 24. The system became better organized, with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400miles (645km) west-southwest of Bermuda. However, a reconnaissance flight into the {{remnants of}} Dean reported a broad low pressure area with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure, indicating <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> non-tropical characteristics. The weak disturbance passed {{to the west of}} Bermuda early on August 25, and subsequently began to drift to the northeast. The remnants of Dean produced convection near its developing circulation, and on August 26, while located 220miles (350km) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re-classified a tropical depression. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not re-initiate advisories until fifteen hours later.|$|E

5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed in {{principle}} to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of names, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names. During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

25|$|Men's {{underwear}} {{was also}} on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to Louisiana from New Jersey, opened a venture capitalist firm named Bossier in Bossier Parish.

The Serrano government reversed the economic slide it inherited, reducing inflation and boosting real growth.|$|E
25|$|The Bauhaus had a {{major impact}} on art and {{architecture}} trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and Israel in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime.

However, these duties would expand {{to include more}} traditionally male jobs such as driving trucks and ambulances, and working as mechanics and radar operators. While most CWACs served in Canada, three companies of female soldiers were posted overseas in 1943.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan for}} what became Mamakating Park {{was laid out}} by William Henry Baldwin, an {{engineer}} from Yonkers.

25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study. He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but do indeed also make plain language assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E
