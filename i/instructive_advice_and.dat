40|$|This paper, {{the first}} in a pair, {{describes}} the development and use of a research tool designed to not only derive the “usual ” research patterns from analysis and synthesis of data, but also to extend that research outcome into useful lessons and instructions for others to act on in the non-research world. Research is essentially about finding and explaining patterns to help us understand phenomena and to measure similarities and differences. Pattern also has other useful attributes – as tools, templates, <b>and</b> <b>instructive</b> <b>advices</b> – that tend not to be given as much attention in research. The tool discussed in this paper seeks an easy-to-use “close fit ” between these two uses of pattern. It enabled maximum engagement by the research participants, in-depth exploration of the area between the abstract (theory) and the concrete (practice) of the issue at hand, and development of useful <b>instructive</b> <b>advices</b> for others to use. It comprises an original design that can be adapted for use in other research with similar aims. A second paper, in a subsequent edition of The Qualitative Report, describes th...|$|R
