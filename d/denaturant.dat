5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the <b>denaturant</b> affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E
25|$|Urea in {{concentrations}} up to 10 M is {{a powerful}} protein <b>denaturant</b> as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins.|$|E
25|$|Downhill folding is {{predicted}} to occur under conditions of extreme native bias, i.e. at low temperatures or {{in the absence of}} denaturants. This corresponds to the type 0 scenario in the energy landscape theory. At temperatures or <b>denaturant</b> concentrations close to their apparent midpoints, proteins may switch from downhill to two-state folding, the type 0 to type 1 transition.|$|E

40|$|Refolding {{is one of}} the {{production}} technologies for pharmaceutical grade antibody fragments. Detergents and <b>denaturants</b> are primarily used to solubilize the insoluble proteins. The solubilized and denatured proteins are refolded by reducing the concentration of the <b>denaturants</b> or detergents. Several refolding technologies have been used for antibody fragments, comprising dilution, dialysis, solid phase solvent exchange and size exclusion chromatography, as reviewed here. Aggregation suppressor or folding-assisting agents, including arginine hydrochloride, ionic liquids and detergents or <b>denaturants</b> at low concentrations, are included in the refolding solvent to enhance refolding yield...|$|R

25|$|The gels {{typically}} {{consist of}} acrylamide, bisacrylamide, the optional <b>denaturant</b> (SDS or urea), and a buffer with an adjusted pH. The solution may be degassed under a vacuum {{to prevent the}} formation of air bubbles during polymerization. Alternatively, butanol may {{be added to the}} resolving gel (for proteins) after it is poured, as butanol removes bubbles and makes the surface smooth.|$|E
25|$|Global {{downhill}} folding (or one-state folding) {{is another}} {{scenario in which}} the protein folds {{in the absence of}} a free energy barrier under all conditions. In other words, there is a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures and <b>denaturant</b> concentrations, suggesting a continuous unfolding transition in which different ensembles of structures populate at different conditions. This is in contrast to two-state folding, which assumes only two ensembles (folded and unfolded) and a sharp unfolding transition.|$|E
25|$|The {{sample to}} analyze is {{optionally}} {{mixed with a}} chemical <b>denaturant</b> if so desired, usually SDS for proteins or urea for nucleic acids. SDS is an anionic detergent that denatures secondary and non–disulfide–linked tertiary structures, and additionally applies a negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Urea breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the nucleic acid, causing the constituent strands to anneal. Heating the samples to at least 60°C further promotes denaturation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} lattice Monte Carlo study {{to examine the}} effect of <b>denaturants</b> on the folding rates of {{simplified}} models of proteins. The two-dimensional model is made from a three-letter code mimicking the presence of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and cysteine residues. We show that the rate of folding is maximum when the effective hydrophobic interaction epsilon H is approximately equal to the free energy gain epsilon S upon forming disulfide bonds. In the range 1 < or = epsilon H/ epsilon S < or = 3, multiple paths that connect several intermediates to the native state lead to fast folding. It is shown that at a fixed temperature and epsilon S the folding rate increases as epsilon H decreases. An approximate model is used to show that epsilon H should decrease {{as a function of the}} concentration of <b>denaturants</b> such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Our simulation results, in conjunction with this model, are used to show that increasing the concentration of <b>denaturants</b> can lead to an increase in folding rates. This occurs because <b>denaturants</b> can destabilize the intermediates without significantly altering the energy of the native conformation. Our findings are compared with experiments on the effects of <b>denaturants</b> on the refolding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and ribonuclease T 1. We also argue that the phenomenon of denaturant-enhanced folding of proteins should be general...|$|R

25|$|Methanol is the {{simplest}} alcohol, being only a methyl group {{linked to a}} hydroxyl group. It is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor {{very similar to that}} of ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption. At room temperature, it is a polar liquid.

25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a <b>denaturant</b> for ethyl alcohol.

25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used <b>denaturant.</b> For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E

They are purely empirical as {{there is little or}} no information on how the folded or unfolded states' property changes with temperature/chemical <b>denaturant.</b> This assumes even more importance in case of DSC experiments as the changes in heat capacity correspond to both fluctuations in the protein ensemble and exposure of hydrophobic residues upon unfolding. The DSC profiles of many small fast-folding proteins are broad, with steep pre-transition slopes. Interestingly, two-state fits to these profiles result in crossing of baselines indicating that the two-state assumption is no longer valid.

40|$|The global {{configuration}} of individual, surface-adsorbed molecules {{of the giant}} muscle protein titin, labeled with rhodamine conjugates, was followed with confocal microscopy. Fluorescence-emission intensity was reduced because of self-quenching caused by the close spacing between rhodamine dye molecules that formed dimers. In the presence of chemical <b>denaturants,</b> fluorescence intensity increased, reversibly, up to 5 -fold in a fast reaction; the kinetics were followed at the single-molecule level. We show that dimers formed in a concentrated rhodamine solution dissociate when exposed to chemical <b>denaturants.</b> Furthermore, titin denaturation, followed by means of tryptophan fluorescence, is dominated by a slow reaction. Therefore, the rapid fluorescence change of the single molecules reflects the direct action of the <b>denaturants</b> on rhodamine dimers rather than the unfolding/refolding of the protein. Upon acidic denaturation, which we have shown not to dissociate rhodamine dimers, fluorescence intensity change was minimal, suggesting that dimers persist because the unfolded molecule has contracted into a small volume. The highly contractile nature of the acid-unfolded protein molecule derives from {{a significant increase in}} chain flexibility. We discuss the potential implications this finding could have for the passive mechanical behavior of striated muscle...|$|R
30|$|Production of {{recombinant}} {{proteins in}} bacterial hosts often produces insoluble intracellular particles called inclusion bodies.

2500|$|As {{with all}} forms of gel electrophoresis, {{molecules}} may be run in their native state, preserving the molecules' higher-order structure. This method is called Native-PAGE. Alternatively, a chemical <b>denaturant</b> may be added to remove this structure and turn the molecule into an unstructured molecule whose mobility depends only on its length and mass-to-charge ratio. This procedure is called SDS-PAGE. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a method of separating molecules based on the difference of their molecular weight. At the pH at which gel electrophoresis is carried out the SDS molecules are negatively charged and bind to proteins in a set ratio, approximately one molecule of SDS for every 2 amino acids. [...] In this way, the detergent provides all proteins with a uniform charge-to-mass ratio, independently of their original charge. By binding to the proteins the detergent destroys their secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure denaturing them and turning them into negatively charged linear poly peptide chains. When subjected to an electric field in PAGE, the negatively charged poly peptide chains travel toward the anode with different mobility. Their mobility, or the distance traveled by molecules, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of their molecular weight. By comparing the relative ratio of the distance traveled by each protein {{to the length of}} the gel (Rf) one can make conclusions about the relative molecular weight of the proteins, where the length of the gel is determined by the distance traveled by a small molecule like a tracking dye.|$|E

The volume of the dilution is adjusted to obtain the relaxation rate at a specific <b>denaturant</b> concentration. The final protein concentration in the mixture is usually 1-20 µM, depending on the constraints imposed by the amplitude of relaxation and the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|In aqueous {{solutions}} {{with high}} concentrations of chemical <b>denaturants</b> such as urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) proteins expand to populate heterogeneous conformational ensembles. These denaturing environments {{are thought to be}} good solvents for generic protein sequences because properties of conformational distributions align with those of canonical random coils. Previous studies showed that water is a poor solvent for polypeptide backbones, and therefore, backbones form collapsed globular structures in aqueous solvents. Here, we ask if polypeptide backbones can intrinsically undergo the requisite chain expansion in aqueous solutions with {{high concentrations of}} urea and GdmCl. We answer this question using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the degree of backbone expansion is minimal in aqueous solutions with high concentrations of <b>denaturants.</b> Instead, polypeptide backbones sample conformations that are denaturant-specific mixtures of coils and globules, with a persistent preference for globules. Therefore, typical denaturing environments cannot be classified as good solvents for polypeptide backbones. How then do generic protein sequences expand in denaturing environments? To answer this question, we investigated the effects of side chains using simulations of two archetypal sequences with amino acid compositions that are mixtures of charged, hydrophobic, and polar groups. We find that side chains lower the effective concentration of backbone amides in water leading to an intrinsic expansion of polypeptide backbones in the absence of <b>denaturants.</b> Additional dilution of the effective concentration of backbone amides is achieved through preferential interactions with <b>denaturants.</b> These effects lead to conformational statistics in denaturing environments that are congruent with those of canonical random coils. Our results highlight the role of side chain-mediated interactions as determinants of the conformational properties of unfolded states in water and in influencing chain expansion upon denaturation...|$|R
