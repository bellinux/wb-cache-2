He would, of course, have to purchase a share [...] in the concern, which would amount to seven thousand pounds, [...] on which he would be paid interest at the rate of five [...] per cent.

5000|$|A {{childhood}} {{acquaintance of}} Timofeev and Ryzhov, Oleg Zhukov, was amongst {{the biggest and}} most loyal fans of [...] "Disco 'Crash'", and soon joined the duo's closest circle of friends. One night, they took him with them to a soirée organized by a company called [...] "Kranek", and all Zhukov did was repeating the company's name during one song. As Timofeev recalls: [...] "And during one of our song, Zhukov repeated the company's name, Kranek, with such a voice, that the audience and us fell for his charm, and since then, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> for good". <b>This</b> happened in 1991. Around that time, the band was invited to Moscow for a trial studio record, resulting in their first album [...] "Танцуй со мной" [...] (Tantsuy so mnoy", Dance with me), but it wasn't what the band expected. Some of its songs were later reused in their first official album.Towards 1997, the trio noticed their club was losing their popularity. They found out that a rival disco opened in town, and people there were charged half as much. They discovered that disco had only one MC, young and motivated, close in style to Timofeev. They decided that it was the best to join forces with him. That's how Alexey Serov joined the band. His first contribution to the band was recording a skit where he asked to turn the music off using lots of expletives (used later in the song [...] "Заколебал Ты!" [...] but with expletives covered by radio parasite sounds), and his second contribution was recording vocals for the second and final version of the song [...] "Двигай-двигай" [...] ("Dvigay-dvigay", Move it-move it).|$|R
