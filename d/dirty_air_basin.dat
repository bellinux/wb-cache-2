40|$|An {{atmospheric}} monitoring network was operated throughout the South Coast <b>Air</b> <b>Basin</b> {{in the greater}} Los Angeles area during the year 1986. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to measure the spatial and temporal concentration distributions of atmospheric gas phase and particulate phase acids and bases in support of the California Air Resources Board's dry deposition research program. Gaseous pollutants measured include HNO_ 3, HCl, HF, HBr, formic acid, acetic acid and ammonia. The chemical composition of the airborne particulate matter complex was examined in three size ranges: fine particles (less than 2. 2 μm aerodynamic diameter, AD), PM_(10) (less than 10 μm AD) and total particles (no size discrimination). Upwind of the <b>air</b> <b>basin</b> at San Nicolas Island, gas phase acids concentrations are very low: averaging 0. 3 μg m^(- 3) (0. 1 ppb) for HNO_ 3, 0. 8 μg m^(- 3) for HCl, 0. 13 μg m^(- 3) for HF, and 2. 6 μg m^(- 3) for formic acid. Annual average HN 03 concentrations ranged from 3. 1 μg m^(- 3) (1. 2 ppb) near the Southern California coast to 6. 9 μg m^(- 3) (2. 7 ppb) at an inland site in the San Gabriel Mountains. HCl concentrations within the South Coast <b>Air</b> <b>Basin</b> averaged from 0. 8 μg m^(- 3) to 1. 8 μg m^(- 3) during the year 1986. Long-term average HF concentrations within the <b>air</b> <b>basin</b> are very low, in the range from 0. 14 to 0. 22 μg m^(- 3) between monitoring sites. Long-term average formic acid concentrations are lowest near the coastline (5. 0 μg m^(- 3) at Hawthorne), with the highest average concentrations (10. 7 μg m^(- 3)) observed inland at Upland. Ammonia concentrations at low elevation within the South Coast <b>Air</b> <b>Basin</b> average from 2. 1 μg m^(- 3) to 4. 4 μg m^(- 3) at all sites except Rubidoux. Rubidoux is located directly downwind of a large ammonia source created by dairy farming and other agricultural activities in the Chino area. Ammonia concentrations at Rubidoux average 30 μg m^(- 3) during 1986, a factor of approximately 10 higher than elsewhere in the <b>air</b> <b>basin.</b> Annual average PM_(10) mass concentrations within the South Coast <b>Air</b> <b>Basin</b> ranged from 47. 0 μg m^(- 3) along the coast to 87. 4 μg m^(- 3) at Rubidoux, the farthest inland monitoring site.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{problems}} affecting residential and light commercial heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are slow refrigerant leaks and <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> filters. Equipment users {{are usually not}} aware of a problem until most of the refrigerant has escaped or the air filter is clogged with dirt. While a <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> filter can be detected with a technology based on the air pressure differential across the filter, such as a ''whistling'' indicator, {{it is not easy}} to incorporate this technology into existing HVAC diagnostic equipment. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is developing a low-cost, nonintrusive refrigerant charge indicator and <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> filter detection sensor. The sensors, based on temperature measurements, will be inexpensive and easy to incorporate into existing heat pumps and air conditioners. The refrigerant charge indicator is based on the fact that when refrigerant starts to leak, the evaporator coil temperature starts to drop and the level of liquid subcooling drops. When the coil temperature or liquid subcooling drops below a preset reading, a signal, such as a yellow warning light, can be activated to warn the equipment user that the system is undercharged. A further drop of coil temperature or liquid subcooling below another preset reading would trigger a second warning signal, such as a red warning light, to warn the equipment user that the unit now detects a leak and immediate action should be taken. The warning light cannot be turned off until it is re-set by a refrigeration repairman. To detect clogged air filters, two additional temperature sensors can be applied, one each across the evaporator. When the air filter is accumulating buildup, the temperature differential across the evaporator will increase because of the reduced airflow. When the temperature differential reaches a pre-set reading, a signal will be sent to the equipment user that the air filter needs to be changed. A traditional refrigerant charge indicator requires intrusion into the system to measure the refrigerant high-side and low-side pressures. Once the pressures are known, based on the equipment's refrigerant charging chart? or in most cases, based on the technician's experience? the refrigerant charging status is determined. However, there is a catch: by the time a refrigeration technician is called, most of the refrigerant has already escaped into the atmosphere. The new technology provides a real-time warning so that when, say, 20 % of the refrigerant has leaked, the equipment users will be warned, even though the equipment is still functioning properly at rated capacity. Temperature sensors are becoming very accurate and very low in cost, compared with pressure sensors. Using temperature sensors to detect refrigerant charge status is inherently nonintrusive, inexpensive, and accurate. With the addition of two temperature sensors for detecting <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> filters, the capability of the diagnostic equipment is further enhanced with very little added cost. This report provides laboratory test data on the change of indoor coil refrigerant temperature and subcooling as a function of refrigerant charge for a 2 -ton split heat pump system. The data can be used in designing the indicators for refrigerant loss and <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> filter sensors...|$|R
40|$|Industry {{is often}} {{faced with the}} problem of {{reducing}} the level of contaminated air in its plants. The common method used is to exhaust the <b>dirty</b> <b>air</b> and replace it with outside air. This requires heating or cooling of the replacement air. Two basic methods to reduce the energy cost of cleaning air are (1) strip the contaminant from the air with high efficiency air cleaners, and (2) pass the contaminated air through a heat exchanger as it is exhausted to atmosphere. The air cleaner method recycles all the air and individual air cleaners can be considered 100 % efficient for the purpose of energy recovery. Since the most common particulate contaminants are in the submicron range (defined as respirable by Industrial Hygienists), the types of air cleaners available that are effective are limited. Air-to-air or air-to-liquid heat exchangers can be used to recover 60 % to 80 % of the energy from exhaust <b>air</b> streams. <b>Dirty</b> <b>air</b> can be either general plant air or air in process exhaust stacks.

This report proposes to amend the transport identification regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70500 (c)) and to make conforming notational changes to the transport mitigation regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70600). The-identification regulation lists the upwind and downwind areas that are the origin and destination of transported air contaminants referred to as “transport couples. ” The transport mitigation regulation requires <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> which are identified as upwind areas in the transport identification regulation to adopt best available retrofit control technology, as defined in Health and Safety Code section 40406, on all existing stationary sources of ozone precursor emissions.
