He {{composed}} his first soundtrack (for “Days of Eclipse” by Alexander Sokurov) already as a Conservatory student."...Yuri Khanin, a young composer, this year a graduate of the Leningrad Conservatory managed to do everything about the orchestration, arrangement and choice of instruments in a very precise way. It was done with an ideal exactitude. Never before had I worked with composers so much, and I was really struck by his understanding. <…> I think that sound, no less than the image, should produce not only emotional impact, but is to have an altogether independent semantic meaning. The spirituality of the film as if finds its expression through the sound. And spirituality would not <b>emerge</b> <b>by</b> <b>itself.</b> If you might sometimes fail to keep alive the memory of a visual image in your mind and in your heart the soul would never forget sounds…" [...] :::::::::::::::::::— ( [...] Alexander Sokurov, from press-conference on September 26, 1988)The film “Days of Eclipse” won the “Euro-Oscar” ("Felix Award") of the European Film Academy in November 1988 in West Berlin in the “Best Music” special nomination. In spite of his great success, after 1991 Yuri Khanon never returned to writing music for the cinema.|$|E

30|$|In China, action, i.e., strategy, is seen {{differently}} {{to the conventional}} view in which direct action (i.e., complexity reduction) is seen to be a necessity for successful implementation of strategy. Contrary to this conventional view, Chinese aim to achieve a goal with as little direct action as possible. Thus, the strategic intention is to modify one’s actions {{in such a way}} as to retain a position of relative strength, whilst retaining a long-term objective (i.e., complexity absorption), that of domination rather than destruction of the opponent. In keeping with this view of the world as a dynamic event, i.e., a complex adaptive system, in which continuous change is the only predictable norm, it is accepted that a successful strategy must be founded on the realization that the situation is, in reality, a continuing present. Thus the successful strategies to deal with complexity are to seek for identifying tendencies in the current situation then acting to manipulate circumstances in ways that enable a trend to develop in such a way that the desired objective will <b>emerge</b> <b>by</b> <b>itself</b> (Aligica, 2007). Therefore, in contrast with the ontology of complexity reduction, Chinese philosophical ideas about social practice (as pragmatic in a value rational way) are impossible to study and present at a sophisticated level by employing a rational structural approach (Zhang et al., 2011). One of the objectives of this research is to offer an alternative perspective to study unique nonlinear entrepreneurial strategy to deal with complexity in the Chinese context.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis: Jægersborggade – et casestudie af en transformativ proces i praksis {{focuses on}} {{community-based}} planning, more precisely by examining Jægersborggade in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen. The thesis {{is situated in}} the academic context of urban geography and planning, employing qualitative research methods of interviews, document research, and more. Theoretically, the thesis utilises theories of various concepts of space, and theories within an empowerment framework. Jægersborggade has within recent years, been thru a significant transformation and change. A change solely planned by the streets community. Once in state of decline, and a stronghold for gang related activities, Jægersborggade {{has become one of}} Copenhagen’s trendiest and well-visited streets, within a surprisingly short period of time. Using this urban scenario as a case-study research, the thesis analyses - thru the concepts of empowerment, social capital and asset based community development - the various placemaking- and social capacities and capabilities, that lies behind this transformative process. Furthermore the thesis will involve an analysis, of how the sudden community change, affects the sense of place and usage of space, examined thru the narratives of the streets occupants, neighbors and storeowners. The thesis shows that community based planning and change, can be a strenuous long-term process in the effort to build and mobilize capacities and resources. It also shows that empowerment processes, in some respect, can succeed without bonding social capital, but also lead to financial dangers, not foreseen by the community. I conclude that community change doesn’t <b>emerge</b> <b>by</b> <b>itself,</b> but needs to be pushed forward by an individual and collective imagination and effort. I furthermore conclude that community based planning can loose oversight of its activities, when based on the individual instead of the collective...|$|E

The History of Guddattu Sri Vinayaka Temple runs back for about 1700 years. The natural rock formation similar to Ganesh Idol is inside a small cave and the natural formation of cave is such that, around thousand Koda of water collects naturally and submerges the Ganesh Idol. It is said that the three foot idol of Lord Vinayaka was <b>emerged</b> <b>by</b> <b>itself,</b> attaching to a big rock. The black and grey stone structure of Lord Ganapathi is in a sitting position. His trunk is towards the right, eyes and legs clearly visible. The pooja of Ayarkoda is performed by devotees with much faith and devotion. The new rock Temple is constructed here, adjacent to a huge granite rock, which looks like a sleeping elephant. This temple is about 35 km from Udupi via Brahmavara - Barkur, Shiriyara, about 15 km from Kundapur via Koteshwara - Hunsemakhi -Guddeangady.|$|R

How {{does your}} {{leadership}} view today’s accelerating pace of business, the rapidity of technological development, the world’s changing economic picture, international crises, challenging climate and weather changes, and volatile political situations in other countries? Organizations {{must be able}} to rapidly adapt if they are to survive and prosper. This is the age of the Agile enterprise, and organizations that are light on their feet and responsive to challenges are the ones that will prevail. Agility Defined To be Agile is to be "able to move quickly and easily; able to think and understand quickly. The power of moving quickly and easily; nimbleness, the ability to think and draw conclusions quickly" (Dictionary. com). Agility includes the concepts of flexibility, balance, adaptability, and coordination. In business, an Agile organization is one that adapts rapidly, productively, and cost-effectively to market and environmental changes (Wikipedia. org).

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the regions {{have emerged as}} 'new actors' in European decisionmaking and policy implementation. The new role assumed by {{regional}} governments and authorities in the European Union (EU) system has <b>emerged</b> neither <b>by</b> <b>itself</b> nor <b>by</b> global moves towards decentralization, but has been actively triggered by the European Commission. Particularly through its strategy of policymaking {{in the framework of}} the Structural Funds, regions and other decentralized actors have been stimulated to play a more active and independent role. For this purpose, the Commission, constrained by a lack of extensive formal powers and competences, has made wide use of informal or underformalized processes and procedures of decisionmaking and policy implementation. These strategies are analyzed with the author's aim of highlighting the most important innovations resulting from the recent reforms of the Structural Funds. The response of the regions to the policy framework set out by the Commission is highlighted through selected examples. On the basis of empirical material, conclusions are drawn with regard to the future development of the EU system as a whole. It is argued that this system will not so much evolve into a fully fledged three-tier system, but rather will be characterized by new modes of regulation which, in the long run, will transform traditional state intervention at all government levels, and by new modes of exercising power which are based on the skillful pooling and sharing of the power resources of many divergent actors, both public and private. ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Water Framework Directive, the need to {{identify}} new monitoring tools in support of the traditional chemical monitoring process is <b>emerging.</b> Chemical characterization <b>by</b> <b>itself</b> does not provide specific biological information about potential hazards to organisms, in particular when facing cocktails of contaminants. Therefore, ecotoxicity tests can represent a useful tool supporting the chemical information. In the present work, the value of ecotoxicity tests as an effect-based tool for monitoring freshwater and sediment quality of the south-western basin of Lake Como (Northern Italy) was evaluated, assessing the potential risk of pollutants. Results obtained from D. magna toxicity tests showed a temporal variation of toxic response in relation to the variability of organic micropollutant load characteristics of urban rivers. Sediment ecotoxicity test data showed the spatial variability of the sediments’ contamination within the lake, confirmed by chemical analysis of two classes of pollutants (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCB)). The observed effects on organisms in laboratory tests caused by a mixture of almost unknown chemicals underline the importance of integrating effect-based tools into monitoring efforts...|$|R

40|$|How {{is human}} reality {{presented}} {{to us in}} phenomenological experience? It is the one we see daily in our personal and social life. We are made of matter, {{we are part of}} the evolutionary universe. In addition, a psychic life is formed in us: sensation, a system of perceptions, an integrated consciousness, a condition of psychological subject; We produce knowledge, emotions, motivations; But, above all, we have a mind that rationally moves and installs us into a world of human emotions; This emotional reason lies {{at the base of the}} search for the truth of the universe, the meaning of life and the moral responsibility, in personal and social life. Our human reality is, therefore, a personal reality. We are persons. Now, how does science, neurology, explain today the fact that our human reality possesses these properties that give us the personal condition? This should be able to be explained (this is the initial assumption) from the physical-biological world. Now, in particular, how does science make it possible to explain that evolution has produced us in our condition of ratio-emotional persons? That is, what is the physical support that makes intelligible the psycho-bio-physical ontology that evolutionarily produces our personal phenomenological experience? This is, ultimately, still the fundamental question of human sciences. What science, namely neurology, must explain (that is, know the causes that have produced it) is obvious: the fact of our sensibility-consciousness, our condition of psychic subjects, knowledge and emotional reason that have emerged in the universe; In such a way that, once the emotional reason <b>emerges,</b> it leads <b>by</b> <b>itself</b> to constitute the rational activity and the emotions of the human person aimed at building the meaning of his life.
