25|$|While Wells {{no longer}} denies the {{existence}} of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his arguments from silence not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed {{a good number of}} decades before.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of Call of the Wildman has prompted Brown's appearance on several television programs, including two visits to The Tonight Show. Shortly after telling his hometown newspaper, the Lebanon Enterprise {{that he wanted}} to meet CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper, Brown was invited to appear on an episode of Cooper's show, Anderson Cooper 360°.

500|$|Jenkins's {{descriptions}} of Widmerpool's appearance are unflattering; at school he is painted as [...] "heavily built, [...] thick lips and metal-rimmed spectacles giving {{his face as}} usual an aggrieved expression... he suspected people of trying to worm out of him important information..." [...] A few years later, he is wearing more fashionable spectacles but Jenkins notes that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> curiously fishlike ("piscine") countenance. [...] He has a propensity to put on weight; although barely 30, Widmerpool appears to Jenkins as portly and middle-aged. [...] At the outbreak of war in 1939, in a badly cut army uniform, he resembles a music-hall burlesque of a military officer or else [...] "a railway official of some obscure country". After the war as an MP, his [...] demeanour and shape are [...] "demanding of treatment by political cartoonists". In 1958, meeting Widmerpool (then in his mid-fifties) after some years, Jenkins is shocked by his elderly appearance. His clothes are ill-fitting through weight loss, giving him {{the look of a}} scarecrow; his grey hair is sparse and his facial flesh hangs in pouches. The final glimpse of Widmerpool, in his cult milieu, reveals him as a physical wreck, looking aged, desperate and worn out.|$|E
50|$|On December 20, 2007, Dingle {{announced}} his intentions to leave West Virginia University {{to enter the}} NFL Draft. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> year of eligibility left, due to being a junior.|$|R

500|$|Wykes {{believes}} that, of the novel's three central characters, only Tony {{is representative}} of his real-life equivalent—Waugh in his pre-Catholic irreligious state. Brenda is portrayed in the novel as typical {{of many of the}} women in Waugh's early stories—well-bred, trivial and faithless—but Wykes argues that she is not a representation of Evelyn Gardner, [...] "neither in inward nor outward qualities". Nor, he asserts, is Beaver intended as an accurate portrayal of [...] Evelyn Gardner's lover, the [...] "dreadful nullity" [...] of Beaver being a form of literary revenge on the erudite Heygate. There is general agreement among commentators that other characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is clearly based on the eccentric but rather less sinister Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the incompetent explorer, reflects W. E. Roth, the curator of the Georgetown museum whom Waugh considered accompanying into the jungle, only to be dissuaded by reports of Roth's irresponsibility and disregard of danger. Thérèse de Vitré, the object of Tony's forlorn attempt at a shipboard romance, was named [...] "Bernadette" [...] in the original manuscript; the change was made as a reference to Waugh's platonic friend Teresa Jungman. Thérèse announces her destiny to marry a rich Catholic, and, in an echo of Jungman, recoils from Tony when she discovers that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> wife. The culmination of Tony's misfortunes, his enslavement to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his father's habit of reading his favourite literature aloud to his family, three or four evenings a week: [...] "...most of Shakespeare, most of Dickens, most of Tennyson... stepping about the room and portraying the characters... he held us enthralled".|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 Market Square {{released}} Ashley's first stripped back solo album, This Little Game, {{which was}} included in both The Telegraph and Folk Radio UK's lists of [...] "The Best Folk Albums of 2015".

Paul Woodgate, reviewing the album for Folk Radio UK, said: [...] "This Little Game may just {{be one of his}} best".|$|E

As he prepares to leave, Maometto promises that while <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hope of possessing Anna, he will protect her father. She insists on something to guarantee her safety in his absence and, {{as a symbol of}} his promise and his protection, he gives her his imperial seal of authority. Urged on by his captains, Maometto vows to fight or die as they leave for battle in the citadel: (Aria: [...] "" [...] / At this gallant request).

2500|$|Mayweather {{said of the}} fight, [...] "This was my last fight. Tonight, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, for sure I chose the right dance partner to dance with. Conor McGregor, you are {{a hell of a}} champion." [...] He added, “He’s a tough {{competitor}} and I think we gave the fans what they wanted to see. I owed them for the Pacquiao fight. I must come straight ahead and give the fans a show, and that’s what I gave them.” McGregor felt the fight was stopped prematurely, but nevertheless respected the decision and admitted he was tired. Mayweather agreed with the stoppage, and explained that he avoided inflicting more damage on McGregor to protect him from brain damage, saying [...] "He has a career. You know, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> career. ...(It could've been) very damaging." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scrooge {{is a very}} {{misunderstood}} person. In {{his early}} years, he was very kind and polite. But the 'slaps' of society from cruel people, {{as well as the}} ungratefulness those who he had helped to overcome their problems, made Scrooge a cruel, selfish, and powerful man. [...] Feeling that he had been taken advantage of, he didn't want to believe that others had real problems or difficulties in their lives. [...] This made him seem obnoxious at best, and heartless at worst. [...] As a result, no one could understand his problems, including his nephew, and his great-nephews. This isolation paved the path to acquiring untold wealth and power. But despite it all, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> good heart, and will help those he sees as distressed or troubled.|$|E

6000|$|Curious how {{the busy}} and {{continually}} watchful and speculating Friedrich, busied about his dangers from Austrian encroachments, from Russian-Turk Wars, Bavarian Successions, and other troubles and anarchies close by, saw nothing to dread in France; nothing to remark there, except carelessly, {{from time to}} time, its beggarly decaying condition, so strangely sunk in arts, in arms, in finance; oftenest an object of pity to him, for <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> love for France;--and reads not the least sign of that immeasurable, all-engulfing FRENCH REVOLUTION {{which was in the}} wind! Neither Voltaire nor he have the least anticipation of such a thing. Voltaire and he see, to their contentment, Superstition visibly declining: Friedrich rather disapproves the heat of Voltaire's procedures on the INFAME. [...] "Why be in such heat? Other nonsense, quite equal to it, will be almost sure to follow. Take care of your own skin!" [...] Voltaire and he are deeply alive, especially Voltaire is, to the horrors and miseries which have issued on mankind from a Fanatic Popish Superstition, or Creed of Incredibilities,--which (except from the throat outwards, from the bewildered tongue outwards) the orthodox themselves cannot believe, but only pretend and struggle to believe. This Voltaire calls [...] "THE INFAMOUS;" [...] and this--what name can any of us give it? The man who believes in falsities is very miserable. The man who cannot believe them, but only struggles and pretends to believe; and yet, being armed with the power of the sword, industriously keeps menacing and slashing all round, to compel every neighbor to do like him: {{what is to be done}} with such a man? Human Nature calls him a Social Nuisance; needing to be handcuffed, gagged and abated. Human Nature, if it be in a terrified and imperilled state, with the sword of this fellow swashing round it, calls him [...] "Infamous," [...] and a Monster of Chaos. He is indeed the select Monster of that region; the Patriarch of all the Monsters, little as he dreams of being such. An Angel of Heaven the poor caitiff dreams himself rather, and in cheery moments is conscious of being:--Bedlam holds in it no madder article. And I often think he will again need to be tied up (feeble as he now is in comparison, disinclined though men are to manacling and tying); so many helpless infirm souls are wandering about, not knowing their right hand from their left, who fall a prey to him. [...] "L'INFAME" [...] I also name him,--knowing well enough how little he, in his poor muddled, drugged and stupefied mind, is conscious of deserving that name. More signal enemy to God, and friend of the Other Party, walks not the Earth in our day.|$|E
