5|$|<b>Germination</b> of cysts is {{accompanied}} by changes in the intima, visible with an electron microscope. The intima consists of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and has almost the same volume as the central body. During <b>germination</b> of cysts, the intima hydrolyses and {{is used by the}} cell for the synthesis its components.|$|E
5|$|Seed <b>germination</b> {{rates are}} quite high. One study found <b>germination</b> rates better than 77% in most batches tested. Seed {{is likely to}} remain viable for a long time, as seed of the closely related B.cuneata remains viable for around ten years.|$|E
5|$|Some Myxogastria {{species may}} produce asexually. These are {{continuously}} diploid. There is no meiosis before the <b>germination</b> of the spores {{and the production}} of the plasmodium proceeds without <b>germination</b> of two cells.|$|E
5|$|Important {{factors for}} the <b>germination</b> of spores are mainly {{moisture}} and temperature. The spores usually remain germinable after several years; {{there were even}} spores preserved in herbarium specimens which germinated after 75 years. After the spores' development, they first receive a diploid nucleus, and the meiosis {{takes place in the}} spore. At the <b>germination,</b> the spore shells open either alongside special germinal pores or chinks, or rip irregularly and then release one to four haploid protoplasts.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{slow growing}} Nepenthes. Under optimal conditions, N. rajah can reach {{flowering}} size within 10years of seed <b>germination.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower <b>germination</b> rates with 13% reduced <b>germination</b> observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for <b>germination.</b>|$|E
5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed <b>germination</b> occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. <b>Germination</b> is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while <b>germination</b> {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers <b>germination</b> is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Periodic {{flooding}} of the Canning River {{from the}} dam {{is required to}} disperse seed, stimulate <b>germination</b> and ensure seedlings survive, recharge shallow groundwater tables that are important during periods of drought and to discourage and prevent weed growth. However, during times of low rainfall periodic flooding is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the <b>germination</b> rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical in design and layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the <b>germination</b> floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the <b>germination</b> floors.|$|E
5|$|Warm air : Exposition {{of seeds}} to warm air (50 to 70Â°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease <b>germination</b> rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in <b>germination,</b> indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the <b>germination</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Mendelssohn {{travelled}} widely, including making his first visit to England in 1829, and also visiting amongst other places Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved the <b>germination</b> for some of his most famous works, including the Hebrides Overture and the Scottish and Italian symphonies.|$|E
25|$|Three {{fundamental}} conditions {{must exist}} before <b>germination</b> can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent <b>germination</b> must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for <b>germination.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>germination</b> {{percentage}} {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The <b>germination</b> rate is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. <b>Germination</b> percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by <b>germination</b> percentage plus the rate of <b>germination.</b> This is given as a percent of <b>germination</b> over a certain amount of time, 90% <b>germination</b> in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the <b>germination</b> rate might be very low.|$|E
25|$|Seeds can be scarified or briefly boiled {{to enhance}} <b>germination.</b> They retain their <b>germination</b> {{capability}} {{for several months}} if kept dry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Germination</b> is {{the process}} by which an {{organism}} grows from a seed or similar structure. The most common example of <b>germination</b> is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm. In addition, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the spores of hyphae from fungal spores, is also <b>germination.</b> Thus, in a general sense, <b>germination</b> {{can be thought of as}} anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.|$|E
25|$|Seed vigor is {{a measure}} of the quality of seed, and {{involves}} the viability of the seed, the <b>germination</b> percentage, <b>germination</b> rate and the strength of the seedlings produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{average weight}} of 1000 seeds is 0.21gram (2,200,000 seeds per pound) and {{experienced}} a 100% <b>germination</b> success before drying and storage and an 87% <b>germination</b> success after drying and 3 years of cool dry storage.|$|E
25|$|Meadâs biggest {{contribution}} to orchidology, after over 25 years of orchid growing, came when Lewis Knudson of Cornell University approached him for advice and assistance in experiments he was performing {{related to the}} possible non-symbiotic <b>germination</b> of orchid seed. By then Mead had realized that <b>germination</b> rates could be made more favorable in a sterile and temperature-controlled environment akin to clean room conditions in a laboratory. Knudsonâs breakthrough involved the use of sterilized agar containing nutrients to achieve reproducible orchid seed <b>germination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seed {{dormancy}} has {{two main}} functions: {{the first is}} synchronizing <b>germination</b> with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading <b>germination</b> of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result {{in the death of}} all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for <b>germination,</b> normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent <b>germination.</b> Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for <b>germination,</b> mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.|$|E
25|$|ABA {{controls}} embryo dormancy, and GA embryo <b>germination.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{morphological}} dormancy, <b>germination</b> is prevented due to morphological {{characteristics of}} the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before <b>germination</b> can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before <b>germination</b> can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are Apiaceae, Cycadaceae, Liliaceae, Magnoliaceae and Ranunculaceae.|$|E
25|$|Propagation through {{division}} {{only has}} a limited rate of success, as many plants that are divided go into shock and eventually die. <b>Germination</b> of Heliamphora seed is achieved by scattering it on milled sphagnum moss and keeping in bright light, humid and warm conditions. Seed <b>germination</b> begins after many weeks.|$|E
25|$|In epigeal <b>germination</b> (or {{epigeous}} <b>germination),</b> the hypocotyl elongates {{and forms}} a hook, pulling rather than pushing the cotyledons and apical meristem through the soil. Once {{it reaches the}} surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.|$|E
25|$|Tetanolysin serves {{no known}} benefit to C. tetani. Tetanospasmin is a neurotoxin {{that causes the}} {{clinical}} manifestations of tetanus. Tetanus toxin is generated in living bacteria, and is released when the bacteria lyse, such as during spore <b>germination</b> or vegetative growth. A minimal amount of spore <b>germination</b> and vegetative cell growth are required for toxin production.|$|E
25|$|Most common annual {{vegetables}} have optimal <b>germination</b> temperatures between 75-90 F (24-32 C), {{though many}} species (e.g. radishes or spinach) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, {{as low as}} 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer <b>germination</b> periods.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{conditions}} affecting seed <b>germination</b> include; water, oxygen, {{temperature and}} light.|$|E
25|$|Three {{distinct}} {{phases of}} seed <b>germination</b> occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and radicle emergence.|$|E
25|$|Pollen <b>germination</b> {{has three}} stages; hydration, {{activation}} and pollen tube emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated {{so that its}} mass is reduced enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. <b>Germination</b> only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature <b>germination</b> does not {{take place in the}} anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.|$|E
25|$|Plant hormones affect seed <b>germination</b> and {{dormancy}} {{by acting}} on {{different parts of}} the seed.|$|E
25|$|Finally, DNA repair enzymes {{contained}} within the endospore are able to repair damaged DNA during <b>germination.</b>|$|E
25|$|The seed {{propagation}} requires numerous months of stratification for effective <b>germination.</b> Seeds {{generally do not}} germinate well directly after harvesting or in dry storage, but germinate well in cold moist sand. Low temperature treatments facilitate the <b>germination</b> process. Chilling treatments are useful to overcome the dormancy of seeds in dry storage. Domestic seeds germinate more effectively than wild ones. The plant propagates readily by root suckering, allowing it to produce indefinitely.|$|E
