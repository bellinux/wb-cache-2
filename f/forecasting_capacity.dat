The positive mathematical programming (PMP) approach guarantees exact calibration to base year data but the <b>forecasting</b> <b>capacity</b> of the model is affected by necessary but arbitrary assumptions imposed during calibration. In this article, a new PMP variant is presented {{which is based on}} less arbitrary assumptions that, from a theoretical point of view, are closer to the actual decision making of the farmer. The PMP variant is evaluated according to the predictions of the bio-economic farm model, developed within the framework for integrated assessment of agricultural systems in Europe (SEAMLESS). The <b>forecasting</b> <b>capacity</b> of the model calibrated with the standard PMP approach and the alternative PMP variant, respectively, is tested in ex-post experiments for the arable farm types of Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees (France).

In June 2011, Betfair – a UK betting exchange – levied a tax of up to 60 % on all future profits accrued by the top 0. 1 % of profitable traders.

We investigate the effect of the new tax on the <b>forecasting</b> <b>capacity</b> of the exchange (our measure of the market's incorporation of information into the price).

30|$|From the {{forecasting}} assumptions one {{may raise}} {{doubts about the}} vitality of plant based weather forecasting to prepare herders for meaningful adaptation. What is significant for drought forecasting is not {{the fact that those}} trees flower a month before the normally anticipated onset of rainfall, rather what is crucial is the amount of flower and their premature shedding. This means that, if trees really ‘foretell’ future weather, herders are left with only short time, about 2  weeks, between the shedding of flowers and the onset of normal rainy season to understand that drought is coming. It is questionable if herders can make viable adjustments with that short duration of <b>forecasting</b> <b>capacity,</b> although herders would suffer harshly without that <b>forecasting</b> <b>capacity.</b> On the other hand, herders have no control to distinguish whether or not the limited flowering and the early fall of flowers is caused by other factors such as disease or moisture stress. In view of the disagreement among Botanists and considering the limited reliability ascribed by herders to the accuracy of weather forecasting based on a reading of plant body language, it is recommended to conduct further research to understand the relationship between changing in plant characteristics and future weather conditions.|$|E
