50|$|Most {{disposable}} earplugs are elastic ones made {{of memory}} foam, that is typically rolled into a tightly compressed cylinder (without creases) by the user's fingers and then {{inserted in the}} ear canal. Once released, the earplug expands until it seals the canal, blocking the sound vibrations that could reach the eardrum. Other disposable plugs simply push into the ear canal without being rolled first. Sometimes earplugs are connected with a cord to keep them together when not in use. Other common material bases for disposable earplugs are viscous wax or silicone. Custom moulded earplugs fall into two categories: Laboratory made and Formed in Place. Laboratory made requires a carefully professionally taken impression {{be made of the}} ear canal and outer ear that is sent to a laboratory to be checked and made into a <b>hearing</b> <b>protector.</b> Formed in place uses the same style of process to make an impression of the ear canal and outer ear and then turns that impression into the protector.

40|$|Many {{people are}} exposed to large sound {{pressure}} levels ei- ther occasionally or regularly, and thus need to protect their hearing {{in order to prevent}} hearing loss and other hearing disorders. Earplugs are effective at attenuating sound from the environment, but they do not attenuate bone-conducted sound, but instead amplify it at low frequencies due to the occlusion effect. This is a problem, e. g., for many mu- sicians and especially wind instrument players, since this low-frequency amplification greatly affects the sound of their own instruments.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} workers' perception of comfort and use aspects regarding two types of hearing protectors (shell and earplug), in three units from a lumbering company, with different implantation times for Hearing Preservation Programs. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study comparing 440 workers' perception of hearing protectors, from three companies in Paraná State (Brazil), with different times for Hearing Preservation Programs. Two closed questionnaires were applied (9 and 10 questions, respectively), with a scale of answers varying from 1 to 5 (Likert's scale) regarding {{the perception of the}} comfort of hearing protectors. Then, audiometry results were analyzed. RESULTS: About 17. 5 % presented audiogram examinations with alterations. With regard to the questionnaire about the comfort perception, the importance of noise attenuation (mean of 4. 25) was the most relevant aspect, followed by communication possibility (mean of 4. 15). In the protector assessment, Unit A with more Hearing Preservation Program time presented better scores for both the worker's perception of important aspects regarding <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> and for the assessment of the used <b>hearing</b> <b>protector.</b> There was a significant difference on communication difficulty {{with the use of a}} <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> among workers with normal and altered audiograms (p= 0. 0371).

40|$|Millions {{of workers}} {{are exposed to}} high noise levels on a daily basis. The primary concern for these {{individuals}} is the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss, which is typically accomplished by wearing of some type of personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protector.</b> However, many workers complain they cannot adequately hear their co-workers when hearing protectors are worn. There are many aspects related to fully understanding verbal communication between noise-exposed workers that are wearing hearing protection. One topic that has received limited attention is the overall voice level a person uses to communicate in a noisy environment. Quantifying this component provides {{a starting point for}} understanding how communication may be improved in such situations. While blocking out external sounds, hearing protectors also induce changes in the wearer’s self-perception of his/her own voice, which is known as the occlusion effect. The occlusion effect and attenuation provided by hearing protectors generally produce opposite effects on that individual’s vocal output. A controlled laboratory study was devised to systematically examine the effect on a talker’s voice level caused by wearing a <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> and while being subjected to high noise levels. To test whether differences between occluded and unoccluded vocal characteristics are due solely to the occlusion effect, speech produced while subjects’ ear canals were occluded was measured without the subject effectively receiving any attenuation from the hearing protectors. To test whether vocal output differences are due to the reduction in the talker’s self-perceived voice level, the amount of occlusion was held constant while varying the effective <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> attenuation. Results show the occlusion effect, <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> attenuation, and ambient noise level all to {{have an effect on the}} talker’s voice output level, and all three must be known to fully understand and/or predict the effect in a particular situation. The results of this study may be used to begin an effort to quantify metrics in addition to the basic noise reduction rating that may be used to evaluate a hearing protector’s practical usability/wearability.

Although {{the use of a}} <b>hearing</b> <b>protector</b> is recommended as a tem-porary solution until action is taken to control the noise, in practice, it ends up as a permanent solution in most cas-es. Therefore, hearing protectors must be both efficient in noise attenuation and comfortable to wear.

40|$|Recreational music {{exposure}} {{is a potential}} risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Augmented <b>hearing</b> <b>protectors</b> have been designed with modified attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types of commercially available <b>hearing</b> <b>protectors</b> were worn, all commonly used during leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs and the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular type of protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the observed temporary shifts differed systematically for {{the different types of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>protectors,</b> with two types of musician earplug showing a more systematic decline than the others.
