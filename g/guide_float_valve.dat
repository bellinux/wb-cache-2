40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a balloon pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> {{to control the}} {{discharge}} flow rates of sample solutions. Because the <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> were made from a photoreactive resin, {{the shapes of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> could be controlled by employing different exposure patterns without any change in the pump configurations. Owing to the simple preparation process of the pump, we succeeded in changing the discharge flow rates in accordance with the number and length of the <b>floating</b> <b>valves.</b> Because our methods could be used to easily prepare balloon pumps with arbitrary discharge properties, we achieved several microfluidic operations by the integration of the balloon pumps with microfluidic devices. Therefore, we believe that the balloon pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> will be a useful driving component for portable microfluidic systems...|$|R

40|$|Piston {{pumps are}} {{difficult}} to match to windmills. In first approximation the pump demands a constant torque for all rotational speeds. For this reason the combination of windmill and pump reaches its maximum performance for a single windspeed called the design windspeed. At standstill the mill only starts running when the windspeed is higher than about 1. 5 the design windspeed. It stops only when the windspeed drops below V which {{is lower than the}} design windsp~~ 8 ~ In the intermediate region the windmill is sometimes running, sometimes standing still. By this fact the overall efficiency is lower than can be expected theoretically. The introduction of start helps can improve the start behaviour considerably. A newly developed start help i. e. the <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> is presented in this paper. A simple theoretical model of the <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> is given, which is in fair agreement with the performed experiments. The pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> was tested under laboratory conditions as well as under field conditions. Comparison of the performance of a mill equipped with a normal pump and a pump with a <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> showed an improved start behaviour and a 60 % increased overall efficiency...|$|R

50|$|The main item in {{the room}} is the {{sanitation}} fixture itself, the toilet. This may be the flushing sort, which is plumbed into a cistern (tank) operated by a ballcock (<b>float</b> <b>valve).</b> Or it may be a dry model, which does not need water.|$|R
25|$|He also {{developed}} a <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> system for the flush tank. Obtaining the patent for it in 1778, he began making toilets at a workshop in Denmark Street, St Giles.

5000|$|... #Caption: The {{ballcock}} or <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> {{is often}} used to regulate the filling of a tank or cistern. When the fluid level drops, the float descends, levering the valve opening and allowing more fluid to enter. Once the float reached the 'full' position, the arm presses the valve shut again.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{is often}} {{described}} as a needle valve, although this is a misnomer. A true needle valve uses a tapered needle in a tapered seat, so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> uses a pointed needle against a square-edged seat, to give a positive shut-off.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper the effect of private roof tanks and of the <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> {{characteristics}} on apparent losses due to water meter errors was investigated via an experimental study. The tests were carried out at the Environmental Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Enna (Italy), on a high-density polyethylene (HDPE 100 PN 16) looped distribution network. The experimental results showed that network pressure {{plays an important role}} in the characterisation of the <b>floating</b> ball <b>valve</b> emitter law, but the tank operating condition is the most relevant aspect to be considered mainly for water meter error evaluation...|$|R
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{centrifugal}} governor by James Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution.

30|$|The {{evaporative}} pad {{provides a}} large water surface, and the pad is wetted by dripping {{water from the}} above source. The EC works by a concentric <b>float</b> <b>valve,</b> which opens when the water level is low in the collecting grill, allowing more water to enter. When the water level returns to the full level, the valve is shut automatically.|$|R
50|$|Lone Chimney Lake {{has been}} plagued by drought-related {{problems}} for nearly a decade. It was nearly drained of municipal water in 2006, when high consumption caused the fixed intake valve to be above the lake's surface. It had to be replaced with a <b>floating</b> <b>valve.</b> The cost was about $19,000, but allowed the lake management to continue supplying its customers.|$|R
5000|$|Modern designs use {{silicone}} rubber in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and <b>float</b> <b>valves</b> {{due to its}} resistance to degradation and its long service life. Natural rubber was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and <b>float</b> <b>valves</b> to leak due to {{a failure of the}} valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small [...] "ping pong" [...] balls in a cage mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, diving masks with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organisations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender {{a false sense of security}} and can be difficult to clear if flooded.|$|R
50|$|Construction is of {{the usual}} cast brass housing for {{plumbing}} parts, with a threaded connection to the pipework at the base. The top has a small outlet, usually hidden beneath a plastic dust cap.

50|$|The {{water level}} in the {{condensate}} tank was controlled by a <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> which opened to replenish it from the fresh water tank {{as soon as the}} water level dropped to below 400 imp gal and automatically closed again as soon as that level was reached again. To provide for any malfunction in the water supply, a hand-operated stop cock was provided on the fresh water tank.|$|R
50|$|Stiffer {{valve springs}} {{can help prevent}} <b>valve</b> <b>float</b> and <b>valve</b> bounce, but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain. Various techniques have been used to offset the effect of stiffer springs, such as dual-spring and progressive-sprung valves, roller-tipped tappets, and pneumatic valve springs.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> of a {{carburettor}} (controlling {{the fuel level}} within the carburettor) is not a needle valve, although it is commonly described as one. It uses a bluntly conical needle, but it seats against a square-edged seat rather than a matching cone. The intention here is to obtain a well-defined seat between two narrow mating surfaces, giving firm shutoff of the flow from only a light float pressure.|$|R
50|$|The rooftop water towers store 25000 to 50000 L {{of water}} {{until it is}} needed in the {{building}} below. The upper portion of water is skimmed off the top for everyday use while {{the water in the}} bottom of the tower is held in reserve to fight fire. When the water drops below a certain level, a pressure switch, level switch or <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> will activate a pump or open a public water line to refill the water tower.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, <b>float</b> <b>valves,</b> mercury switches, {{and other}} devices though {{concerns}} about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alcohol-filled, galinstan-filled, digital, or thermistor-based instruments. It remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|R

40|$|In many Mediterranean countries, users store water {{resources}} in private tanks, which are typically located on rooftops. These local reservoirs are generally connected {{directly to the}} water distribution network (WDN). This installation scheme causes a disconnection of the WDN from the users, and thus, the users’ water supply is no longer linked to their consumption, which changes the network operating conditions from the designed conditions. For WDNs characterized {{by the presence of}} several private tanks, specific models have to be developed to correctly simulate the operation of the WDN while accounting for reservoirs located between the hydraulic network and users. Some mathematical models that are able to reproduce the tank emptying/filling cycles have already been developed, which combine a tank continuity equation with a <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> emitter law. In the present work, a new emitter law is proposed that improves the predictability of actual models. The new formulation takes into account the variation of the emitter coefficient and of the discharge area during the phases of the filling process of private tanks. Specifically, hyperbolic tangent laws were adopted. A comparison between the proposed mathematical model and the experimental data demonstrated the ability of the new law to estimate the flow discharging into private tanks independently of the <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> branch and of the pressure in the network. The developed model can easily be implemented in hydrodynamic models to take private tanks into account...|$|R
