Honey bees were repelled by the DDT for 6 days after application, but {{there was no evidence that}} it repelled bumble bees. Some mortality accured in field bees, but it was not very high and hives were not weakened and brood was not affected. It is considered that DDT emulsion, if applied before bees visist a <b>flowering</b> <b>brassica</b> crop, will cause only slight mortality. It should be valuable for use when a crop must be sprayed to save it from destruction by pests. Thiodan exerted no repellency and was more lethal to field bees than DDT. Although no adverse effect on adult bees or brood was observed in the apiary it is considered that the hives would have been seriously affected if an area of more than one acre had been sprayed.

40|$|In nature, herbivorous {{insects and}} plant {{pathogens}} are generally abundant when plants are flowering. Thus, plants face {{a diversity of}} attackers during their reproductive phase. Plant responses to one attacker can interfere with responses to a second attacker, and phytohormones that orchestrate plant reproduction are also involved in resistance to insect and pathogen attack. We quantified phytohormonal responses of flowering plants exposed to single or dual attack and studied resistance mechanisms of plants in the flowering stage. <b>Flowering</b> <b>Brassica</b> nigra were exposed to either a chewing caterpillar, a phloem-feeding aphid or a bacterial pathogen, and plant hormonal responses were compared with dual attack situations. We quantified phytohormones in inflorescences and leaves, and determined the consequences of hormonal changes for components of direct and indirect plant resistance. Caterpillars were the main inducers of jasmonates in inflorescences, and the phytohormonal profile of leaves was not affected by either insect or pathogen attack. Dual attack increased plant resistance to caterpillars, but compromised resistance to aphids. Parasitoid performance was negatively correlated {{with the performance of}} their hosts.

40|$|Plants evolved {{strategies}} to attract pollinators {{that are essential}} for reproduction. However, plant defence against herbivores may trade off with pollinator attraction. Here, we investigated the role of inducible plant secondary metabolites in such a trade-off. Our objective was to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of induced plant responses to pollination and herbivory. We assessed how responses of plants to pollination and insect herbivory affect the behaviour of flower visitors. Subsequently, we investigated how the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds changes after pollination and herbivory. Both herbivores and pollinators induced important phenotypic changes in <b>flowers.</b> <b>Brassica</b> nigra plants respond to pollination and herbivory with changes in the profile of volatiles and non-volatiles of their flowers. Our results show that butterflies use different cues when searching for an oviposition site or a nectar source. Pollination status influenced the behaviour of butterflies, but not that of syrphid flies. We discuss the results {{in the context of}} the trade-off between defence and reproduction in plants and suggest that systemic responses to herbivores can interfere with local responses to pollination. Therefore, these responses must be addressed in an integrated way because, in nature, plants are simultaneously exposed to herbivores and pollinators.

40|$|The {{survival}} of insect herbivores typically is constrained by food choice and predation risk. Here, we explored whether movement from leaves to flowers increases {{survival of}} herbivores that prefer {{to feed on}} floral tissues. Combining field and greenhouse experiments, we investigated whether flowering influences the behavior of Pieris brassicae butterflies and caterpillars and, consequently, herbivore survival in the field. In this context, we investigated also if <b>flowers</b> of <b>Brassica</b> nigra can provide caterpillars refuge from the specialist parasitoid Cotesia glomerata and from predatory social wasps. By moving to flowers, caterpillars escaped from the parasitoid. Flowers are nutritionally superior when compared with leaves, and caterpillars develop faster when feeding on flowers. However, late-stage caterpillars can be preyed upon intensively by social wasps, irrespective of whether they feed on leaves or flowers. We conclude that flower preference by P. brassicae is more likely driven by nutritional advantages and reduced parasitism on flowers, than by risks of being killed by generalist predators...|$|R
40|$|Plant-specific WRKY {{transcription}} factors (TFs) {{have been}} implicated {{to function as}} regulators of leaf senescence, but their association with postharvest leaf senescence of economically important leafy vegetables, is poorly understood. In this work, the characterization of a Group IIe WRKY TF, BrWRKY 65, from Chinese <b>flowering</b> cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> rapa var. parachinensis) is reported. The expression of BrWRKY 65 was up-regulated following leaf chlorophyll degradation and yellowing during postharvest senescence. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays showed that BrWRKY 65 was localized in the nucleus and exhibited trans-activation ability. Further electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transient expression analysis clearly revealed that BrWRKY 65 directly bound to the W-box motifs in the promoters of three senescence-associated genes (SAGs) such as BrNYC 1 and BrSGR 1 associated with chlorophyll degradation, and BrDIN 1, and subsequently activated their expressions. These findings demonstrate that BrWRKY 65 may be positively associated with postharvest leaf senescence, at least partially, by the direct activation of SAGs.

40|$|The {{monolayer}} tapetum {{cells of}} the maturing <b>flowers</b> of <b>Brassica</b> napus contain abundant subcellular globuli-filled plastids and special lipid particles, both enriched with lipids {{that are supposed to}} be discharged and deposited onto the surface of adjacent maturing pollen. We separated the two organelles by flotation density gradient centrifugation and identified them by electron microscopy. The globuli-filled plastids had a morphology similar to those described in other plant species and tissues. They had an equilibrium density of 1. 02 g/cm 3 and contained neutral esters and unique polypeptides. The lipid particles contained patches of osmiophilic materials situated among densely packed vesicles and did not have an enclosing membrane. They exhibited osmotic properties, presumably exerted by the individual vesicles. They had an equilibrium density of 1. 05 g/cm 3 and possessed triacylglycerols and unique polypeptides. Several of these polypeptides were identified, by their N-terminal sequences or antibody cross-reactivity, as oleosins, proteins known to be associated with seed storage oil bodies. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the lipid particles indicate that they are novel organelles in eukaryotes that have not been previously isolated and studied. After lysis of the tapetum cells at a late stage of floral development, only the major plastid neutral ester was recovered, whereas the other abundant lipids and proteins of the two tapetum organelles were present in fragmented forms or absent on the pollen surface...|$|R
40|$|Background The role {{of plant}} {{ontogeny}} on investment in direct defense against herbivores is well accepted, but {{the transition from}} the vegetative to the reproductive stage can also affect indirect resistance traits (i. e. attraction of the natural enemies of plant attackers). Here, we conducted behavioral bioassays in olfactometers to determine whether the developmental stage (vegetative, pre-flowering, and <b>flowering)</b> of <b>Brassica</b> rapa plants affects attraction of Cotesia glomerata, a parasitoid of the herbivore Pieris brassicae, and examined the blends of volatile compounds emitted by plants at each developmental stage. Results Pieris-infested plants were always more attractive to parasitoids than control plants and plants infested by a non-host herbivore, independently of plant developmental stage. On the other hand, the relative attractiveness of Pieris-infested plants was ontogeny dependent: Pieris-infested plants were more attractive at the pre-flowering stage than at the vegetative stage, and more attractive at the vegetative stage than at the flowering stage. Chemical analyses revealed that the induction of leaf volatiles after herbivory is strongly reduced in flowering plants. The addition of synthetic floral volatiles to infested vegetative plants decreased their attractiveness to parasitoids, suggesting a trade-off between signaling to pollinators and parasitoids. Conclusion Our results show that putative indirect resistance traits are affected by plant development, and are reduced during B. rapa reproductive stage. The effects of ontogenetic shifts in resource allocation on the behavior of members of the third trophic level may have important implications for the evolution of plant defense strategies against herbivores...|$|R

Although both belong to a same species, there is great difference in morphology between flowering Chinese cabbage and pak choi, as the former is non-heading, and has flat green leaves and bolting flower stem. In addition, few transient transformation methods of flowering Chinese cabbage were reported, which seriously hindered its genetic research. Therefore, we aimed to develop a simple and efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation system that utilized root absorption for research in flowering Chinese cabbage and to optimize the key factors of transformation efficiency, including Agrobacterium cell density, transformation time, and hyperosmotic pretreatment conditions.

We analyzed two pairs of lines showing cross-incompatibility (S(2) and S(2 -b); S(13) and S(13 -b)). In S(2) and S(2 -b), SRKs were more highly conserved than SLGs. This was also the case with S(13) and S(13 -b). This suggests that the SRKs of different lines must be conserved for the lines to have the same self-recognition specificity. In particular, SLG(2 -b) showed only 88. 5 % identity to SLG(2), which is comparable to that between the SLGs of different S haplotypes, while SRK(2 -b) showed 97. 3 % identity to SRK(2) in the S domain.

First- and second-instar caterpillars were observed to feed primarily on leaves, whereas late second and early third instars migrated via the small leaves of the flower branches to the flower buds and flowers. Once flower feeding began, no further leaf feeding was observed. We investigated growth rates of caterpillars having access exclusively to either leaves of flowering plants or flowers. In addition, we analyzed glucosinolate concentrations in leaves and flowers. Late-second- and early-third-instar P. brassicae caterpillars moved upward into the inflorescences of B. nigra and fed on buds and flowers until the end of the final (fifth) instar, after which they entered into the wandering stage, leaving the plant in search of a pupation site. Flower feeding sustained a significantly higher growth rate than leaf feeding. Flowers contained levels of glucosinolates up to five times higher than those of leaves.

The results indicated that the NH??-N was recovered by 92, 36 and 70 %, respectively, using the selected chemicals at pH 9. 0 and a molar ratio of Mg:N:P= 1 : 1 : 1. The MAP precipitate (MgNH?PO?. 6 H?O) as struvite was examined by scanning electron microscopy and the results showed that the MAP precipitate had a typical morphology of elongated tubular and short prismatic crystals. The MAP precipitate was also analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy and the analytical results indicated its composition of 4. 9 % N, 8. 6 % Mg and 16 % P, which was similar to the standard struvite composition of 5. 7 % N, 9. 9 % Mg and 12. 6 % P. To investigate the fertility of the MAP precipitate, a set of pot trial tests was conducted. Four quick-growth vegetables, Chinese <b>flowering</b> cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> parachinensis), Chinese chard (Brassica rapa var. chinensis), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) and water convolvulus (Ipomea aquatica, I. reptans), were planted in sandy clay (Red Earth) and the MAP precipitate was applied as a fertilizer. The germination and growth of the selected vegetables in the pots with MAP showed significantly greater rates than those in the pots without MAP as control tests. The experiment also demonstrated that over-dosing of about 2 - 8 times of MAP in the soil did not cause any problems with water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) growth, due to its limited solubility in water. MAP application as a fertilizer did not result in more heavy metals in the vegetables than those from soil and model fertilizer, whereas the higher levels of P and Mg in the vegetables would stimulate vegetables¡¦ growth.

In the present study, we constructed several mutants of subdomains K 1 –K 3 and investigated the mechanisms involved in the heterologous interaction of BjFLC/BjSVP and in the homologous interaction of BjFLC/BjFLC or BjSVP/BjSVP. Yeast two-hybrid and β-Galactosidase activity assays showed that the 19 amino acids of the K 1 subdomain in BjSVP and the 17 amino acids of the K 1 subdomain in BjFLC were functional subdomains that {{interact with each other}} to mediate hetero-dimerization.

Under high P supply, canola plants had accumulated sufficient P by early flowering (GS 4. 7) for maximum yields. Under adequate P supply, yield loss occurred when P was removed at early flowering (GS 4. 7), predominantly due {{to a combination of}} fewer siliques and fewer seeds per silique on branches. Yield loss when P supply was removed at late flowering (GS 4. 9 - 5. 5) was due to fewer seeds per silique on branches. Early P removal caused more P remobilization from vegetative organs to the seed. When K was supplied until later growth stages, K concentration in the silique walls increased under both adequate and high K supply. Stem K concentrations also increased under high supply. The results suggest that when P supply is near-limiting, canola requires a continued supply of P post-flowering for maximum seed yields...|$|R
40|$|Vernalization is {{required}} to induce <b>flowering</b> in cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> oleracea var Capitata L.). Since FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) {{was identified as a}} major repressor of flowering in the vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two homologs of AtFLC, BoFLC 3 - 2 and BoFLC 4 - 1, were isolated from cabbage to investigate the molecular mechanism of vernalization in cabbage flowering. In addition to the sequence homology, the genomic organization of cabbage FLC {{is similar to that of}} AtFLC, except that BoFLC has a relatively smaller intron 1 compared to that of AtFLC. A vernalization-mediated decrease in FLC transcript level was correlated with an increase in FT transcript level in the apex of cabbage. This observation is in agreement with the down-regulation of FT by FLC in Arabidopsis. Yet, unlike that in Arabidopsis, the accumulation of cabbage FLC transcript decreased after cold treatment of leafy plants but not imbibed seeds, which is consistent with the promotion of cabbage flowering by vernalizing adult plants rather than seeds. To further dissect the different regulation of FLC expression between seed-vernalization-responsive species (e. g. Arabidopsis) and plant-vernalization-responsive species (e. g. cabbage), the pBoFLC 4 - 1 ∷BoFLC 4 - 1 ∷GUS construct was introduced into Arabidopsis to examine its vernalization response. Down-regulation of the BoFLC 4 - 1 ∷GUS construct by seed vernalization was unstable and incomplete; in addition, the expression of BoFLC 4 - 1 ∷GUS was not suppressed by vernalization of transgenic rosette-stage Arabidopsis plants. We propose a hypothesis to illustrate the distinct mechanism by which vernalization regulates the expression of FLC in cabbage and Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} to flowering {{is a major}} developmental switch in angiosperms, the timing of {{which is expected to}} be important for fitness. In this thesis the focus has been on identification of genes affecting natural variation in <b>flowering</b> time in <b>Brassica</b> nigra. The background for this thesis is an earlier QTL-mapping study in B. nigra. The genomic area with the greatest effect on flowering time in that study contained a homolog to the CONSTANS gene, which is known to affect flowering time in A. thaliana. When studied more closely this gene did not seem to affect flowering time variation in B. nigra. Near the B. nigra CO gene (BniCOa), however, we identified a homolog to the related CONSTANS LIKE 1 (COL 1) gene. In A. thaliana COL 1 has not been shown to be associated with induction of flowering but since the B. nigra homolog (BniCOL 1) in the QTL area showed surprising amounts of variation between early and late flowering plants we set out to test if this variation was associated with flowering time variation. In the first paper we found a significant association between flowering time and one indel (Ind 2) in the coding region. Motivated by the results in paper one, we searched for evidence of selection at the BniCOL 1 (paper two). In paper three the aim was to validate the results from the first paper in a larger sample of populations, and to check whether the association found in paper I could reflect linkage disequilibrium with areas outside of the gene. Finally, in paper four we investigate the general evolution of three CONSTANS-LIKE genes in B. nigra, namely BniCOL 1, BniCOa and BniCOb...|$|R
40|$|To gain new {{insights}} into the mechanism underlying cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), we compared the nuclear gene expression profiles of <b>flowers</b> of a <b>Brassica</b> napus CMS line with that of the fertile B. napus maintainer line using Arabidopsis thaliana flower-specific cDNA microarrays. The CMS line used has a B. napus nuclear genome, but has a rearranged mitochondrial (mt) genome consisting of both B. napus and A. thaliana DNA. Gene expression profiling revealed {{that a large number of}} genes differed in expression between the two lines. For example, nuclear genes coding for proteins that are involved in protein import into organelles, genes expressed in stamens and pollen, as well as genes implicated in either cell-wall remodeling or architecture, were repressed in the CMS line compared with B. napus. These results show that the mt genome of the CMS line strongly influences nuclear gene expression, and thus reveal the importance of retrograde signalling between the mitochondria and the nucleus. Furthermore, flowers of the CMS line are characterized by a replacement of stamens with carpelloid organs, and thus partially resemble the APETALA 3 (AP 3) and PISTILLATA (PI) mutants. In accordance with this phenotype, AP 3 expression was downregulated in the stamens, shortly before these organs developed carpelloid characteristics, even though it was initiated correctly. Repression of PI succeeded that of AP 3 and might be a consequence of a loss of AP 3 activity. These results suggest that AP 3 expression in stamens depends on proper mt function and a correct nuclear–mt interaction, and that mt alterations cause the male sterility phenotype of the CMS line...|$|R
40|$|One {{prerequisite}} for {{a deeper understanding}} of genetics of adaptive variation is the identification and analyses of genes affecting such variation. In this thesis, I have searched for genes affecting variation in the adaptive trait flowering time in diffe rent Brassica species. Comparative QTL mapping of flowering time indicated that duplicated copies of one ancestral gene, possibly CONSTANS (CO) might regulate <b>flowering</b> in several <b>Brassica</b> species. A region homologous to the CO region of Arabidopsis thal iana is present in three copies in diploid, and six copies in polyploid Brassica species, and QTL mapped to two out of three regions in the diploids, and three out of six in the polyploid. The two QTL identified in B. nigra were studied further. CO allele s from early and late flowering plants were isolated from both QTL regions (Bni COa and Bni COb). No effect of allelic variation at Bni COa on flowering time was detected when comparing A. thaliana co mutants transformed with the two B. nigra alleles. However, allelic variation at Bni CONSTANS LIKE 1 (Bni COL 1) located 3 kb upstream of Bni COa showed association with flowering time in natural populations of B. nigra. Specifically, an 18 bp indel in Bni COL 1 showed significant association with flowering time in several populations. These results and more thorough studies support a hypothesis where a naturally occurring quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) for flowering time affects the function of Bni COL 1 or the expression of Bni COa through variation in the intergenic region between COL 1 and COa. Analysis of variation at Bni COb suggested that it {{has been turned into a}} pseudogene although some aspects of the data are difficult to reconcile with the loss of function...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to prove the {{occurrence}} of the arrhenotokous parthenogenesis in Osmia excavata All ken and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) by means of the biological experiments. The principles of experiments arc (1) to liberate the virgin females which are controlled under low temperature conditions to the field later than their normal flying season, or (2) to liberate the virgin females of the newly introduced species to a habitat where the species does not occur. The first method was devised for Osmia excavata and the second to Osmia cornifrons. It is clear that Osmia cornifrons has never been found in Kyushu. Accordingly, the liberation of the virgin females of this species in Kyushu may afford a valid key to prove the occurrence of parthenogenesis. A preliminary experiment by the first method for Osmia excavata was succeeded in 1954 (see Table 1), but the following summary is the result of experiments conducted in 1955. On February 8, 1955, the overwintering adult females of Osmia excavata were put into the thermostat regulated at 4 ～ 5 ℃. They were 60 in number, devided 3 groups containing 20 bees each. The first group of the red marked bees was liberated on May 9, at 10 : 00 (fine, 20 ℃), transfering immediately from the thermostat (5 ℃) to the field. Then, 7 out of 20 flew away soon, and 13 bees early next morning. After all, 14 females were established until May 13 afternoon. The results of their nesting activities were shown in Table 2. The second liberation of the white marked bees was practised a w eek later, on May 16, at 16 : 00 (fine, 26 ℃). In this case, 17 out of 20 flew away early next morning, 1 at noon, and the rest on May 18 morning. Among these, only 5 bees were established. The results were shown in Table 3. The third liberation of the yellow marked bees was conducted a fortnight later from the first one, on May 23, at noon(fine, 25 ℃), transfering immediately from the thermostat (5 ～ 7 ℃), too. In this case, 10 out of 20 flew away on that day, and the rest next morning. Although 8 out of 20 established, none of them completed a nest or a larval cell with only one exception. For example, one bee began nesting on May 25 morning, but her first egg was deposited on May 31 evening. Thus, it took about a week to construct a single larval cell! It seemed probable that these unhappy results were caused principally by the lack of pollen and nectar at that time. The second method for Osmia cornifrons was conducted as follows: A short series of nests of Osmia cornifrons was collected at Ka r u izawa, Honshu, in the summer of 1954. From these, 23 females were obtained. On February 8, these (overwintering) females were put into the thermostat regulated at 4 ～ 5 ℃. The liberation was conducted on April 5. In this case, 19 out of 23 flew away within a week and 4 found to be dead. Among these, only 4 were established. The results were shown in Table 4. It is concluded through Tables 2 to 4 that th e males of Osmia excavata and Osmia cornifrons are produced from the unfertilized eggs. It is of great interest to note that the following facts were clarified by the liberations of virgin females of Osmia excavata during the off season. 1. The structure of the nests were confused. Namely, (a) the lengths of larval cells were proved to be irregular, making a remarkable contrast to the normal nest, in which the larval cells became shorter towards the entrance, and (b) an empty cell was built between the larval cells. 2. Owing to the shortage of the suitable pollen and nectar, (a) the nesting abilities of female bees were decreased and (b) most of bees were forced to divide their labours. For example, the female bees of Osmia excavata are used to collect pollen and nectar simultaneously from the <b>flowers</b> of <b>Brassica.</b> While, in the off season of <b>flowering</b> period of <b>Brassica,</b> it was frequently observed that she sucked honey from the nectar of the flowers of white clover, and then flew away for searching pollen. Several kinds of pollens (undetermined) were detected in these cells. 3. The parasitism of the larvae of a species of Meloid beetles was newly observed. 4. Many larvae were killed by the decease caused by an unknown bacterium. 5. Many unhatched eggs were recorded beyond expectation. 1. シロオビツツハナバチの越年中の雌蜂を 5 ℃前後の低温処理によつてその活動期をほぼ 1 ヵ月おくらせ, 野外で雄が死滅した頃を見計つてこの雌蜂(処女蜂) を放飼して営巣産卵させた. 2. その結果シロオビツツハナバチの雄産性処女生殖を確認した. 3. 但し 1954 年度の実験では 1 つの巣に 3 匹の雌蜂が存在したが, この雌蜂が不授精卵から生じたものか或は実験の失敗によるのかは明かでない. 4. この実験の弱点を補うために, 本州産のコツノツツハナバチの処女蜂を放つて営巣産卵させ, その結果本種においても雄産性処女生殖の存在を知つた. 5. 活動期をおくらせたシロオビツツハナバチの処女蜂によつて営巣された巣の虫室長は不規則となり, 正常の場合にみられる虫室長の逓減が不明瞭となつた. また虫室間に空室が設けられた巣も現われた. 6, 更に活動期がずれたことによつて(a) 花粉・蜜源植物が缺乏した結果蜂の営巣能力が衰え, しかも花粉と蜜は別個の花から採集するようになり, (b) 天敵として新たにツチハンミョウが登揚し, 細菌性の病気によつて死亡する幼虫が増加し, (c) 卵が孵化せずに終つたものが多数認められた...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{butterflies}} and caterpillars in the genus Pieris and {{plants in the}} family Brassicaceae {{are among the best}} explored in the field of insect–plant biology. However, we report {{here for the first time}} that Pieris brassicae, commonly assumed to be a typical folivore, actually prefers to feed on <b>flowers</b> of three <b>Brassica</b> nigra genotypes rather than on their leaves. First- and second-instar caterpillars were observed to feed primarily on leaves, whereas late second and early third instars migrated via the small leaves of the flower branches to the flower buds and flowers. Once flower feeding began, no further leaf feeding was observed. We investigated growth rates of caterpillars having access exclusively to either leaves of flowering plants or flowers. In addition, we analyzed glucosinolate concentrations in leaves and flowers. Late-second- and early-third-instar P. brassicae caterpillars moved upward into the inflorescences of B. nigra and fed on buds and flowers until the end of the final (fifth) instar, after which they entered into the wandering stage, leaving the plant in search of a pupation site. Flower feeding sustained a significantly higher growth rate than leaf feeding. Flowers contained levels of glucosinolates up to five times higher than those of leaves. Five glucosinolates were identified: the aliphatic sinigrin, the aromatic phenyethylglucosinolate, and three indole glucosinolates: glucobrassicin, 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin, and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin. Tissue type and genotype were the most important factors affecting levels of identified glucosinolates. Sinigrin was by far the most abundant compound in all three genotypes. Sinigrin, 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, and phenylethylglucosinolate were present at significantly higher levels in flowers than in leaves. In response to caterpillar feeding, sinigrin levels in both leaves and flowers were significantly higher than in undamaged plants, whereas 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin leaf levels were lower. Our results show that feeding on flower tissues, containing higher concentrations of glucosinolates, provides P. brassicae with a nutritional benefit in terms of higher growth rate. This preference appears to be in contrast to published negative effects of volatile glucosinolate breakdown products on the closely related Pieris rapae. ...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} was to assess the risk of gene flow from Brassica crops by insectmediated pollen transport. I {{measured}} the viability of pollen in <b>Brassica</b> <b>flowers</b> throughout crop development and compared this with the viability of pollen transported by insects inside and outside one early- and one late-season crop. In order to evaluate the relative importance of different species in pollen transport, I measured abundance of flower visitors during crop development, and measured the foraging behaviour of five key pollinator species throughout the growing season, in relation to variation in microclimate, crop phenology and the relative abundance of other pollinator species competing for flower resources. Flower visiting insects of Brassica rapa crops were highly diverse, and their abundance and diversity changed with crop phenology. I found similar abundances at the family level for both crops studied, although capture rates were greater in the early- than in the late-season crop. Across flowering development, the greatest numbers of insects were captured at the peak of flowering for both crops. During the flowering period, Diptera was the most abundant order collected, followed by Hymenoptera. The most abundant family in Hymenoptera was Apidae which tracked crop development in both fields, with greater numbers of insects captured inside than outside the field. Standardized-count pollen loads were smaller in Diptera than in Hymenoptera. Of the five key pollinator species sampled, Lasioglossum sordidum (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) transported similar pollen loads, which were much greater than those carried by Eristalis tenax (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Melangyna novae-zealandiae (Diptera: Syrphidae). The numbers of insects captured outside of the crop were 10 % and 33 % of the totals captured inside for the early- and the late-season crop, respectively. The proportion of insects entering versus leaving the crop varied considerably across species, crops and trap location (i. e., whether traps were inside or 50 m outside the border of the crop). However, it is worth noting that not uncommonly more insects were attracted into the crop early in the season, staying there rather than leaving, and then when flowers started to disappear there was a massive escape of insects leaving. This research provides evidence for the influence of crop age on the foraging behaviour of key pollinators and for species-specific variation in the foraging behaviour of Brassica visitors with crop development. Temporal variation in the rate and variability of movement between flowers, and the duration and variability in time spent on each flower, throughout the growing season differed markedly between pollinator species. Flower density, plant density, and the abundance of other insects contributed to the observed variation in pollinator behavioural activity for A. mellifera, E. tenax, M. novae-zelandiae and L. sordidum. Bombus terrestris had the greatest rates and variability of movement, and the greatest rates of flower visitation among all key pollinators studied. Therefore B. terrestris might contribute to gene flow to a greater extent than other key pollinators. Additionally B. terrestris had the greatest variability in the rate of movement, increasing the risk of pollen movement over long distances. In summary, I found that (i) insect abundance and diversity changed with crop phenology and Diptera was the most abundant order collected, (ii) flower density, plant density, and the abundance of other insect pollinators were important factors explaining pollinator behaviour for all key pollinators, except B. terrestris, (iii) B. terrestris might contribute to gene flow to a greater extent than other key pollinators, because it has a greater rate of flower visitation and a greater flight distance between flowers than other pollinators, and (iv) pollen viability tended to decrease with crop development and declined sharply even just 50 m outside the edge of the crop...|$|R
