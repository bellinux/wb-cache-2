On November 2, 2008, it debuted atop of the UK Singles Chart, staying there for three consecutive weeks and becoming the fastest-selling single of 2008.

5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of August, they {{continued}} offensive operations, even launching daylight raids upon the German positions. On 22 August they attacked once more, advancing through the village of Bray, capturing a number of German prisoners. After a brief lull in the fighting, they continued the advance again on 25 August capturing Clery at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> before taking Allaines on 2 September. Throughout September the Germans began to withdraw back towards the Hindenburg Line and the 3rd Division {{took part in the}} operations undertaken to follow them up and harass the rearguard. Casualties during this phase had been high, however, and as a result the division's pioneers were used as infantry and even led the advance towards Buire on 6 September.|$|E

5|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he was}} {{following}} his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> {{the two men had}} a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito {{and the rest of}} the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

40|$|Background. Inconsistent data exist about <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> probiotics in <b>the</b> {{treatment}} <b>of</b> constipated children. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to investigate <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> probiotics in childhood constipation. Materials and Methods. In this placebo controlled trial, fifty-six children aged 4 – 12 years with constipation received randomly lactulose plus Protexin or lactulose plus placebo daily for four weeks. Stool frequency and consistency, abdominal pain, fecal incontinence, and weight gain were studied at the beginning, after <b>the</b> first <b>week,</b> and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 th <b>week</b> in both groups. Results. Forty-eight patients completed the study. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>week,</b> <b>the</b> frequency and consistency of defecation improved significantly (P= 0. 042 and P= 0. 049, resp.). At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>week,</b> fecal incontinence and abdominal pain improved significantly in intervention group (P= 0. 030 and P= 0. 017, resp.) but, at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>week,</b> this difference was not significant (P= 0. 125 and P= 0. 161, resp.). A significant weight gain was observed at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1 st <b>week</b> in <b>the</b> treatment group. Conclusion. This study showed that probiotics had a positive role in increasing the frequency and improving the consistency at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 4 th <b>week...</b>|$|R
25|$|Towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Jesus has the Last Supper {{with his}} disciples, {{during which he}} institutes the Eucharist, and prepares them for his {{departure}} in the Farewell Discourse. After the supper, Jesus is betrayed with a kiss while he is in agony in the garden, and is arrested. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and Peter denies him three times, as Jesus had predicted during the Last Supper. The final week that begins with his entry into Jerusalem, concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday.|$|E
