Despite {{the nature of}} the single tooth design resulting in increased air gap harmonic content, having has consequences for the machines' design, performance & operation, the topology has been shown previously to be competitive for high efficiency drives. A key design constraint in the design of synchronous reluctance motors is maximizing the direct axis inductance and minimizing the quadrature axis inductance for a high saliency ratio. The effect of increased leakage inductance on this saliency ratio is explored with emphasis placed on design aspects of such single tooth wound synchronous reluctance motors. It is shown that careful design of the machine is required to maximize the saliency ratio in this machine topology and that the dominant leakage <b>inductance</b> <b>component</b> is the air gap harmonic leakage...|$|E
40|$|Shunt damping for {{piezoelectric}} actuators {{has been}} extensively studied using passive, tuned or negative capacitance components. Recently it has been noted that a capacitor together with a negative resistance amplifier {{can also be used}} for shunt damping using electrodynamic actuators with a low cut-off frequency. However simulations presented in this study indicate that this method is not appropriate for electrodynamic actuators with a high electrical cut-off frequency. This study compares experimental and simulation results of three control approaches obtained with a simple electrodynamic shaker that has a high electrical cut-off frequency: first, proportional current feedback; second, induced voltage feedback estimated with a Wheatstone bridge and third, induced voltage feedback estimated with an Owens bridge which compensates for the inductance of the shaker.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{progress}} made in material growth and device processing, high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) in AlGaN/GaN system {{is emerging as}} a promising candidate for next generation RF/microwave power amplifiers. There are also recent interests in extending the applications to other RF/microwave front-end building blocks including LNAs, VCOs, and mixers. In order to develope complete GaN-based RFIC and MMIC, HEMTs as well as passive components are needed to integrate together with fully compatible fabrication process. In addition, high performance RFIC and MMIC can only be realized with high performance HEMTs and passive components with high Quality-factor (Q-factor). Passive components including varactors (voltage-controlled capacitor) and air-bridged spiral inductors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system with HEMT compatible fabrication process. Varactor, with its tunable capacitance, is essential for tunable circuits such as VCOs and multipliers. It is important to maintain high Q-factor within a wide voltage-controlled tuning range for varactors to be useful in RF/microwave circuits. For example, a high efficiency VCO with low phase noise requires a high quality LC-tank, in which, both the varactor and inductor need to possess high Q-factor. Several methods were utilized to boost up the Q-factor of varactor include Optimization made in Device Structure (Single and Double Channel HEMT structures), Physical Design and Fabrication Process. Different types of varactors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system for the comparison of Q-factors. Spiral inductor is a common type <b>inductance</b> <b>component</b> used in RFIC and MMIC. Air-bridged spiral inductors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system and bare sapphire with high Q-factors achieved. There were totally four types of pillar structures made to support the air suspended spiral inductors. With different types of pillar structures, trade-offs are made in Q-factors, reliabilities and mechanical supports. The fabrication of varactor and air-bridged spiral inductor were fully compatible with AlGaN/GaN HEMT process, allowing easy integration with HEMT circuits without additional fabrication steps.

To address this problem, this paper presents a triaxial deformation sensor with corresponding measurement electronics based on lock-in technique to pick up the sensing signals for deformation reconstruction. Simulations and experiments were carried out to explore the relationship between mutual inductance and triaxial deformation, including longitudinal compression from 3 to 4. 8 mm, inclination angle from - 20 degrees to 20 degrees, and orientation angle from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. The results indicate that the orientation angle beta can be expressed in terms of arctan function of the mutual inductance and longitudinal compression rho can be achieved through polynomial fitting method.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the design and {{development}} of an integrated magnetic (IM) structure for use in high-power high-current power converters employed in renewable energy applications. These applications require low-cost, high efficiency and high-power density magnetic components and the use of IM structures can help achieve this goal. A novel CCTT-core split-winding integrated magnetic (CCTT IM) is presented in this thesis. This IM is optimized for use in high-power dc-dc converters. The CCTT IM design is an evolution of the traditional EE-core integrated magnetic (EE IM). The CCTT IM structure uses a split-winding configuration allowing for the reduction of external leakage inductance, which is a problem for many traditional IM designs, such as the EE IM. Magnetic poles are incorporated to help shape and contain the leakage flux within the core window. These magnetic poles have the added benefit of minimizing the winding power loss due to the airgap fringing flux as they shape the fringing flux away from the split-windings. A CCTT IM reluctance model is developed which uses fringing equations to accurately predict the most probable regions of fringing flux around the pole and winding sections of the device. This helps {{in the development of a}} more accurate model as it predicts the dc and ac <b>inductance</b> of the <b>component.</b> A CCTT IM design algorithm is developed which relies heavily on the reluctance model of the CCTT IM. The design algorithm is implemented using the mathematical software tool Mathematica. This algorithm is modular in structure and allows for the quick and easy design and prototyping of the CCTT IM. The algorithm allows for the investigation of the CCTT IM boxed volume with the variation of input current ripple, for different power ranges, magnetic materials and frequencies. A high-power 72 kW CCTT IM prototype is designed and developed for use in an automotive fuelcell-based drivetrain. The CCTT IM design algorithm is initially used to design the component while 3 D and 2 D finite element analysis (FEA) software is used to optimize the design. Low-cost and low-power loss ferrite 3 C 92 is used for its construction, and when combined with a low number of turns results in a very efficient design. A paper analysis is undertaken which compares the performance of the high-power CCTT IM design with that of two discrete inductors used in a two-phase (2 L) interleaved converter. The 2 L option consists of two discrete inductors constructed from high dc-bias material. Both topologies are designed for the same worst-case phase current ripple conditions and this ensures a like-for-like comparison. The comparison indicates that the total magnetic component boxed volume of both converters is similar while the CCTT IM has significantly lower power loss. Experimental results for the 72 kW, (155 V dc, 465 A dc input, 420 V dc output) prototype validate the CCTT IM concept where the component is shown to be 99. 7 % efficient. The high-power experimental testing was conducted at General Motors advanced technology center in Torrence, Los Angeles. Calorific testing was used to determine the power loss in the CCTT IM component. Experimental 3. 8 kW results and a 3. 8 kW prototype compare and contrast the ferrite CCTT IM and high dc-bias 2 L concepts over the typical operating range of a fuelcell under like-for-like conditions. The CCTT IM is shown to perform better than the 2 L option over the entire power range. An 8 kW ferrite CCTT IM prototype is developed for use in photovoltaic (PV) applications. The CCTT IM is used in a boost pre-regulator as part of the PV power stage. The CCTT IM is compared with an industry standard 2 L converter consisting of two discrete ferrite toroidal inductors. The magnetic components are compared for the same worst-case phase current ripple and the experimental testing is conducted over the operation of a PV panel. The prototype CCTT IM allows for a 50 % reduction in total boxed volume and mass in comparison to the baseline 2 L option, while showing increased efficiency...|$|R
