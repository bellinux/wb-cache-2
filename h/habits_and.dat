40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between self-concept, study <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement of students. Survey method is used to select a sample of 381 students at the higher secondary level. The Self-concept Inventory (Deo, 1985) is used to study self-concept, Study Habits Inventory (Gopal Rao, 1974) is used to assess study <b>habit,</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement marks scored by students in their quarterly examination were taken for academic achievement scores. The results of the statistical analyses show a significant correlation between self-concept, study <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement of students. A significant difference is found between students at the higher secondary level in state, matriculation and central board schools, pertaining to self-concept, study <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement...|$|R

5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing.

5|$|Each June, on Garter Day, {{the members}} of the Order, wearing their <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an {{investiture}} ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> garter insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his <b>habits,</b> <b>and</b> obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|Ants (family Formicidae in {{the order}} Hymenoptera) are the most species-rich of all social insects, with more than 12,000 {{described}} species and many others awaiting description. Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies, of which 17 contain extant taxa, while four are exclusively fossil. Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, {{with the exception of}} tundra and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of social behaviors, foraging <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> associations with other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.|$|E

The improvement in patient satisfaction with bowel <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> treatment was maintained during treatment for up to 24 months; prucalopride therapy was generally well tolerated.|$|R

5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him.

Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies.
