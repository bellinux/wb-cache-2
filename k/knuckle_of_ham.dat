60|$|The {{grandfather}} humbly {{pulled off}} his hat and thanked her. The lady of the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise, but the drum proving an inconvenient table for two, they descended again, and sat upon the grass, where she handed down to them the tea-tray, the bread and butter, the <b>knuckle</b> <b>of</b> <b>ham,</b> and in short everything of which she had partaken herself, except the bottle which she had already embraced an opportunity of slipping into her pocket.|$|E

The tea-things, including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold <b>knuckle</b> <b>of</b> <b>ham,</b> were set forth upon a drum, covered with a white napkin; and there, as if at the most convenient round-table in all the world, sat this roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying the prospect.|$|E
