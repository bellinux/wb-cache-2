40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} {{methodology}} for the power generation optimization on large cruise ships in order to improve their operating efficiency, fuel saving and, consequently, to reduce exhaust gas emissions. The <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> <b>analysis</b> is compared to the machinery reports of actual data in order to investigate if the estimated required power is appropriately close to the real power demand. Relevance is given to the average load of the diesel-generators, which expresses an indication of how the generators work. The model of the ship electric distribution system represents one of the main objectives of this work along with the power system simulations. These were developed through the definition of load profiles, both by the onboard recordings and by machinery reports data. Therefore, the same cruise profile is analyzed under different scenarios, the real and the optimized one, in order to highlight the critical state of the system and any possible margin for improvement...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the recent}} need of more {{flexibility}} in electrical ship systems exploitation, especially {{in the context of}} "All Electric Ships", and because of the uncertainty in evaluating the <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> demand at design stage, a more rational approach is necessary for a satisfactory <b>Electrical</b> Plant <b>Load</b> <b>Analysis</b> (EPLA). In this work, instead of the traditional load factors method, stochastic approaches are analysed to characterize loads with the direct purpose of decreasing the amount of electrical power installed on-board. Three stochastic models describe loads that are always "on", loads that cycle on and off independently of others and loads that depends on the considered configuration. Once the model and a distribution are chosen, a variant of the Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to evaluate the total load probability density function (pdf) for some operational scenarios such as cruising, manoeuvring, in port and navigation...|$|R

50|$|In operation, the {{squirrel-cage}} motor {{may be viewed}} as a transformer with a rotating secondary. When the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large rotor currents are induced; the large rotor currents magnetize the rotor and interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor almost into synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded {{squirrel-cage motor}} at rated no-load speed will consume electrical power only to maintain rotor speed against friction and resistance losses. As the mechanical load increases, so will the <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> - the <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> is inherently related to the mechanical load.

Field experiments demonstrated the technical feasibility of a computer-based load management system and provided data for validating the model. Simulations of the University farm system using input data from the field experiments were used to fine tune <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> management parameters and logic.

These experiments tested the effects of five demand setpoints (12 to 24 kW) at three levels of task frequency. Experiments were performed both with and without the generation of miscellaneous, uncontrolled <b>electrical</b> <b>loads.</b> Simulation results indicated several tradeoffs when selecting an electrical demand setpoint. Low setpoints improved daily load factor with greater peak reductions but also increased the risk of not satisfactorily completing all farm tasks. ^ The approach used in evaluating on-farm <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> management systems was illustrated.

40|$|Abstract ––Load Forecast {{is a basic}} goal in {{electrical}} power system. Optimal operation, maintenance, and planning based on a good prediction of the <b>electrical</b> <b>load.</b> Higher error of <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> estimation (either increase or decrease) may leads to problems in this system. Therefore, the choice of high accuracy model gives critical to the system power. <b>Electrical</b> <b>load</b> forecast is classified into three categories. Short, medium and long term forecasting. This research focus on the short and medium term forecast. Peak load was recorded daily for one selected area of Mosul city for four years period. The data contain a seasonal component due to weather effect on <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> especially temperature effect. Also contains a linear trend component due to growth in <b>electrical</b> <b>load.</b> Exponential smoothing method (Holt-Winter Seasonal method) {{can be used to}} predict the <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> of such specifications.

Holt-Winter Method was applied to load data in three cases; the first case was to the original data without process. In the second case the method was applied to the data processed by statistical method, while in the third case the method was applied to the data treated using Wavelet Technique. Loads were estimated according to the three cases for seven, thirty and fifty day's period ahead.

30|$|In this paper, {{the power}} system is {{designed}} to operate under the base case with unit commitment and generation dispatch decisions corresponding to forecasted values of <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> and wind generations in the day-ahead market, while generation dispatches can be adaptively and securely adjusted when possible realizations of uncertainties happen in real time. Only wind and <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> uncertainties in power systems are considered in this paper. The reasons are twofold: 1) <b>Electrical</b> <b>load</b> uncertainty {{is a very important}} factor that will impact day-ahead power system operation schedules [21, 22, 24]. Thus, following the convention of traditional robust optimization based power system operation models, this paper considers <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> uncertainty. 2) Natural gas system is regarded as highly reliable with sufficient line-pack capacities for handling gas load uncertainties [13], and in turn natural gas load uncertainty is usually not included. In addition, due to the nonlinearity of natural gas Weymouth flow equation, gas load uncertainty is very hard to be incorporated into the second-stage max–min robust framework. This mathematical challenge will be investigated in authors’ future work.|$|R

40|$|The present work reports {{experimental}} {{results on the}} fracture behavior of conductive cracks or deep conductive notches in poled and depoled PZT- 4 ceramics. The fracture tests were conducted with compact tension specimens under purely mechanical <b>loading,</b> purely <b>electrical</b> <b>loading</b> and combined mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>loading.</b> Finite element calculations were carried out to obtain the energy release rate, the stress intensity factor and the intensity factor of electric field strength of the specimens. The {{results show that the}} critical energy release rate under purely either <b>electrical</b> or mechanical <b>load</b> is a constant, independent of the ligament length of the specimens. However, for both the poled and depoled ceramics, the electrical fracture toughness in terms of the critical energy release rate is much higher than the mechanical fracture toughness. The highly electrical fracture toughness arises from the greater energy dissipation around the conductive sharp notch tip under purely <b>electrical</b> <b>loading,</b> which is impossible under mechanical loading in the brittle ceramics. Furthermore, the critical energy release rated under combined <b>electrical</b> and mechanical <b>loading</b> depends on the weight of the <b>electrical</b> <b>load</b> in comparison with the mechanical load. We normalize the critical stress intensity factor by the critical stress intensity factor under purely mechanical loading and normalize the critical intensity factor of electric field strength by the critical intensity factor of electric field strength under purely <b>electrical</b> <b>loading.</b> Then, a quadratic function describes the relationship between the normalized critical stress intensity factor and the normalized critical intensity factor of electric field strength.
