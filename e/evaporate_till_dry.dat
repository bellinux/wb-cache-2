40|$|Two {{dozen of}} {{bryophyte}} species was collected from native habitat types across Europe to test if the ethanol extract {{can affect the}} growth of various microorganisms. After start-up test the ethanol extract did not show any influence on growth and development to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Thus, the further tests focused on the Gram-positive bactreia. The ethanol extract of 5 g bryophyte material was macerated in liquid nitrogen, and then extract was <b>evaporated</b> <b>till</b> <b>dry.</b> The dry residue was dissolved in 5 ml of methanol. This was used in further analyses by MIC and MBC techniques. The result obtained showed the most effective extracts were those made from Pellia endiviifolia and Bazzania trilobata. Phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi C. albicans showed resistance to extracts of any bryophyte species tested. Gram-positive bacterias, namely Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19111) and Bacilus subtilis (ATCC 6633) were intolerant to extracts of liverworts P. endiviifolia and B. trilobata. MIC value for two above mentioned liverworts extract tested were 7 - 12 mm, while referent antibiotic (rifampicin) inhibitory zone were 15 - 35 mm. The most resistant to any bryophyte extracts was Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), while the most sensitive was B. subtilis (ATCC 6633) with MIC values obtained 0. 01 - 0. 19 mg/ml. The results obtained show clear antimicrobial potential of P. endiviifolia and B. trilobata, however further research are needed...|$|R

Fresh vegetables are of the focal points of this study, since they are a significant source of phenolic antioxidants.

For this purpose, samples of fresh bio-vegetables were bought and divided into three groups, one of which was treated with an illegal dose of cypermethrin.

Her father sent her to a small town called Manifest, Kansas while he worked a railroad job somewhere else. She arrived there to find that it was run-down and greatly affected by the Great Depression. A pastor took her in, and in that house, she discovered a box of mementos and letters stashed away under a floorboard.

40|$|Effects of evaporation/condensation on {{spreading}} {{and contact}} angle were experimentally studied. A sessile drop of R- 113 was tested at different vapor environments {{to determine the}} effects of evaporation/condensation on the evolution of contact diameter and contact angle of the drop. Condensation on the drop surface occurs at both the saturated and a nonsaturated vapor environments and promotes the spreading. When the drop is placed in the saturated vapor environment it tends to completely wetting and spreads rapidly. In a nonsaturated vapor environment, the evolution of the sessile drop is divided three stages: condensation-spreading stage, evaporation-retracting stage and rapid contracting stage. In the first stage the drop behaves as in the saturated environment. In the evaporation -retracting stage, the competition between spreading and evaporation of the drop determines the evolution characteristics of the contact diameter and the contact angle. A lower evaporation rate struggles against the spreading power to turn the drop from spreading to retracting with a continuous increase of the contact angle. The drop placed in open air has a much higher evaporation rate. The strong evaporation suppresses the spreading and accelerates the retraction of the drop with a linear decrease of the contact diameter. The contraction of the evaporating drops is gradually accelerated when the contact diameter decreases to 3 min and less <b>till</b> <b>drying</b> up, though the evaporation rate is gradually slowing down...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro antimicrobial activity of a methanolic extract of Salvadora persica solution on Helicobacter pylori isolated from duodenal ulcer. Over 22 strains of H. pylori were isolated from duodenal ulcer from August 2010 to June 2011. The S. persica stem was purchased from a local herb market and finely powdered. Extraction was performed with 60 % methanol using a soxhlet extractor for 48 h until the solvent turned colorless while being incubated in an oven at 40 °C for 48 h <b>till</b> <b>dried.</b> Dry powder was used to determine antimicrobial activity by the agar ditch method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract were determined by the agar dilution method. At concentrations of 10, 100, 200, 500 µg/mL, no zone of inhibition around the ditches was observed while a clear zone of inhibition (12 mm) was detected at 1000 µg/mL concentration for all the isolates. The best antimicrobial activity was observed at MIC 1000 µg/mL (P≤ 0. 05). Furthermore, 10 out of 22 isolates were inhibited at 750 µg/mL of the extract. The MBC results showed that at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL all cells were dead while at a concentration of 750 µg/mL of S. persica a few H. pylori cells were still able to form colonies on Brucella agar supplemented with sheep red blood cells and antibiotics. From the above results it can be concluded that high concentration of S. persica could inhibit the growth of H. pylori and MIC and MBC were similar at that concentration...|$|R

In addition to genotype, {{as the most important}} factor, the production and quality of sheep milk is affected by numerous physiological factors, so the aim of this research was to determine the influence of paragenetic factors (stage and number of lactation) on daily milk yield and chemical composition (total solids, milk fat, protein, casein, lactose, total solids non fat) of Paška sheep milk. Three herds were chosen by random selection within the areas of Kolan and Caska, and survey was conducted on a total of 213 Paška sheep. Stage of lactation was divided to: the beginning (to 50 th-day), the middle (from 51 st till 100 thday) and the end (101 st -day <b>till</b> <b>dry</b> out) of lactation. Depending on the number of lactation, sheep were grouped into five groups (1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th and others).

The Paška sheep had the highest daily milk production in the mid lactation (773 g), and the third lactation (712 g) recorded. At the end of lactation, total solids, milk fat, protein, casein, total solids non fat in milk were significantly higher than at the beginning and middle of lactation. The highest share of total solids, milk fat, protein and casein was determined in Paška sheep milk at 5 th lactation and other lactations.
