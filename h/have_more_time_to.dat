5|$|The {{issue of}} the double burden is {{exacerbated}} in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work when they have children in order to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take care of them.|$|E
5|$|Often {{the most}} senior and {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), who no longer runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme. Since a Troop Leader {{is not required to}} plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts who are in their final year of school choose to become Troop Leaders to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} a lava flow is {{commonly}} massive and crystalline, flow banded or layered, with microscopic groundmass crystals. The more viscous lava forms tend to show sheeted flow features, and blocks or breccia entrained within the sticky lava. The crystal size at {{the centre of}} a lava will in general be greater than at the margins, as the crystals <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow.|$|E

50|$|In a {{biological}} context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> evolve, adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions {{to sustain a}} suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants.|$|R

In general, citizens <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on political and social activities {{because they do not}} have to worry about daily subsistence. Thus, civil society has a strong presence in the United States and provides an arena through which the government can affect daily life.|$|E
25|$|The Board {{ultimately}} {{ruled that}} Sullenberger {{had made the}} correct decision, reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed for higher altitudes, when pilots <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deal with the situation, and that while simulations showed that the plane might have just barely {{made it back to}} LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so, with no time allowed for assessing the situation.|$|E

25|$|Some women self-select out {{of higher}} status positions, {{choosing}} instead to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend {{at home and}} with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home. Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions {{in order to maintain}} the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 2013, Hicks and Gillett {{finally decided}} to drop their case in the English Law Courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three {{directors}} {{on the board of}} Liverpool F.C. {{at the time of the}} sale of the club to NESV. They also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillett. Earlier in the week, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court Trial, so they could <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> raise the monies needed to fund the multi million pound lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|Engel did {{not agree}} with the committee's report, which {{contained}} proposals {{for the creation of a}} committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite—in this case, the Executive—and handing it to another—a group of senior Back Benchers'. She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done , we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> investigate and deliberate.|$|E

25|$|Cardboard, {{aluminium}} foil, {{and plastic}} bags {{for well over}} 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in Chad by the combined efforts of the Jewish World Watch, the Dutch foundation KoZon, and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased Arabic gum, and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are healthier and they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.|$|E
500|$|Academic Sandi Mann's {{interviews}} {{found that}} the British wished and demanded cordiality from service personnel, more than from their coworkers. Israelis, Americans, and Australians, on the other hand, wanted friendliness from both their coworkers and service personnel. Mann explains that the British do not expect a [...] "smiley" [...] display from colleagues because they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> build longer-term relationships. Those in the service industry, though, have to become [...] "one-minute friends" [...] each time they interact with customers.|$|E
500|$|On the Russian side, Kutuzov also {{realized}} Napoleon {{needed to do}} battle; so instead of clinging to the [...] "suicidal" [...] Austrian defense plan, Kutuzov decided to retreat. He ordered Pyotr Bagration to contain the French at Vienna with 600 soldiers, and instructed Bagration to accept Murat's ceasefire proposal so that the Allied Army could <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> retreat. It was later discovered that the proposal was false and {{had been used in}} order to launch a surprise attack on Vienna. Nonetheless, Bagration was able to hold off the French assault for a time by negotiating an armistice with Murat, thereby providing Kutuzov time to position himself with the Russian rearguard near Hollabrunn.|$|E
50|$|Witwer {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election in 2008. Witwer served as Campaign Manager for his successor, Representative Cheri Gerou.

25|$|The {{writings}} of Barret {{are from a}} notable intrinsic quality.

500|$|The episode then cuts {{back to the}} Griffin family household, with Peter {{immediately}} rehashing {{the argument}} between him and Chris that first started in [...] "Blue Harvest", a joke grounded {{in the fact that}} Chris' voice actor, Seth Green, is one of the creators and producers of the stop motion comedy series Robot Chicken. Peter begins by suggesting that Robot Chicken {{would never be able to}} top the story he had just told. Hearing this, Chris defends Robot Chicken. Peter continues to poke at Chris and finally states that he [...] "may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> tell another story" [...] entitled Without a Paddle, a critically panned movie in which Seth Green starred. Chris then angrily storms off yelling [...] "Fuck you" [...] to Peter.|$|E
500|$|Davidson {{gave up the}} editor's {{chair in}} late 1964 in order to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write, and was {{initially}} replaced by Joseph Ferman, who handed over control to his son Edward from May 1965, though the masthead did not reflect the change till 1966. [...] Four years later the younger Ferman took over from his father as publisher as well, and moved the editorial and publishing offices to his house in Cornwall, Connecticut. [...] His wife, Audrey, was business manager, and Andrew Porter was an assistant editor. [...] In the early 1970s Ferman contacted Sol Cohen, the owner of Amazing Stories and Fantastic Stories, two competing sf magazines, about purchasing them both. [...] Ferman was considering combining them into a single magazine and publishing them alongside F, but Cohen decided to keep both titles.|$|E
500|$|National parliamentarians also {{generally}} have staff and money, which could ease the funding {{issues associated with}} forming a new world parliamentary assembly. Delegates to a directly elected UNPA, on the other hand, would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> devote to the global assembly, since its members would not be occupied with duties relating to their membership in their national legislature. Heinrich points out strategic advantages of an indirectly elected UNPA: [...] "Another advantage to basing representation in a UN Parliamentary Assembly on national parliaments {{is that it may}} engage parliamentarians as allies in the cause of getting the assembly established, and, later, helping to build the political will for its evolution. The experience of being a UN parliamentarian will galvanize many of these politicians into going home as advocates for the UN, including the need for strengthening and democratizing the UN Parliamentary Assembly itself." ...|$|E

25|$|When Shunryu {{had first}} come to Zoun-in, eight other boys were {{studying}} there. By 1918, {{he was the}} only one who stayed.

During this period Suzuki wanted to leave Zoun-in but equally didn't want to give up.|$|R
