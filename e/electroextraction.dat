40|$|Abstract The use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) as a phar-maceutical tool has {{increased}} since {{it represents a}} safer vector for gene transfer compared to viral vectors. Differ-ent pDNA extraction methods have been described; among them is alkaline lysis, currently the most commonly used. Although alkaline lysis represents an established method for isolation of pDNA, some drawbacks are recognized, such as entrapment of pDNA in cell debris, leading to lower pDNA recovery; the time-consuming process; and increase of the volume due to the buffers used, all leading to increased cost of production. We compared the con-centration of extracted pDNA when two methods for extracting pDNA from Escherichia coli were used: alkaline lysis and a method based on membrane electroporation, <b>electroextraction.</b> At the same time, we also studied the effect of different pulse protocols on bacterial inactivation. The concentration of pDNA was assayed with anion exchange chromatography. When alkaline lysis was used, two incubations of lysis time (5 and 10 min) were com-pared {{in terms of the}} amount of isolated pDNA. We did not observe any difference in pDNA concentration regardless of incubation time used. In <b>electroextraction,</b> different pulse protocols were used in order to exceed the pDNA concentration obtained by alkaline lysis. We show that <b>electroextraction</b> gives a higher concentration of extracted pDNA than alkaline lysis, suggesting the use of electro-poration as a potentially superior method for extracting pDNA from E. coli. In addition, <b>electroextraction</b> repre-sents a quicker alternative to alkaline lysis for extracting pDNA...|$|E

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} {{is a great}} {{option for}} analyzing metabolomics compounds since the analytes are often charged. The technique is simple and cost-efficient {{but it is not}} the most popular equipment because it lacks high concentration sensitivity. Therefore, on-line concentration techniques have been developed for capillary electrophoresis. The aim of this thesis is to give an introduction to the most common on-line concentration methods in capillary electrophoresis, and to demonstrate a novel on-line concentration technique termed <b>electroextraction.</b> Until now, the research of on-line concentration techniques in capillary electrophoresis is mainly focused on methods based on field amplification, transient isotachophoresis, titration incorporated methods or sweeping, which are presented in the literature section. In a two-phase <b>electroextraction,</b> the electrodes are placed in an aqueous acceptor phase and in an organic donor phase, in which the analytes are dissolved. When the voltage is applied, the conductivity difference in the two phases cause high local field strength on organic phase leading to fast migration of the cationic analytes towards the cathode. As soon as the analytes cross the solvent interface, their migration speed decrease and they are concentrated at the phase boundary. In these experiments, a normal capillary electrophoresis analyzer was used with a hanging aqueous phase droplet at the tip of the capillary inlet. The experimental part was carried out at Leiden University, Division of Analytical BioSciences in the Netherlands. An electroextraction-capillary electrophoresis system was built for the analysis of biological acylcarnitine compounds. After the method parameters were assessed with ultraviolet detection, the method was coupled with mass spectrometric detection, and the selectivity and repeatability were briefly tested. Sensitivity was enhanced with the <b>electroextraction</b> procedure but the extraction factors were not satisfactory yet. Selectivity of <b>electroextraction</b> was discovered when the extraction of acylcarnitines was performed using different solvents. All parameters affecting the <b>electroextraction</b> procedure were not tested, and therefore the instability of the method was not completely understood. Thus, the method should be further investigated and optimized. In fact, all on-line concentration methods ought to be optimized for the target analytes in their existing matrix. Vain tiivistelmÃ¤.

40|$|In this {{research}} paper, {{we show that}} capillary <b>electroextraction</b> (cEE) is capable of fast online peptide concentration and {{that it can be}} coupled online to LC-MS to result in a fast and sensitive method. <b>Electroextraction</b> takes place when an electrical field is applied in a two-phase liquid-liquid system. Sample molecules in the organic phase migrate very fast into the aqueous phase and are concentrated in a small zone. In this work, cEE of peptides is developed and coupled online to LC-MS via a switching valve. Comparison of 10 min of cEE-LC-MS with a normal LC-MS injection showed more than 100 -fold increased peak heights. Of five model peptides, good calibration curves in the range of 0. 05 - 5 Î¼mol/L were obtained. The linearity was good (R 2 values between 0. 984 and 0. 996) and RSD between 5 % at the highest to 25 % at the lowest concentration (n= 3). The LOD of bradykinin, angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin I was in the low nmol/L range. Analysis of a tryptic digest of eight model proteins resulted in more than 170 peptides, without bias for pI or hydrophilicity. Urine analysis is demonstrated, resulting in an LOD around 0. 04 Î¼mol/L urine for tryptic cytochrome C peptides spiked to urine and an increase of 42 % in the number of chromatographic peaks compared with the conventional LC-MS. In summary, cEE-LC-MS is a fast electrophoresis-driven sample preconcentration technique that is quantitative, able to extract a wide peptide range and applicable to bioanalysis.

40|$|Using an {{electrolysis}} {{cell with}} separate compartments, he polarization and impedance of the zinc electrode {{have been investigated}} in highly acidic sulfate electrolytes. It is shown that (i) zinc deposition implies a multi-step mechanism and takes place when hydrogen evolution remains passivated on the deposit surface, and (it) the presence of Ni 2 + ions and/or H 202 molecules in the electrolyte depassivates the reaction of hydrogen evolution and enhances the rate of zinc corrosion. The experimental results have been simulated {{on the basis of}} a reaction model in which hydrogen evolution on the oxidized adsorbates (ZnOad or ZnOHJ generated near the corrosion potential is clearly distinct from hydrogen evolu-tion on the metal surface involving ZnH,d, which inhibits zinc deposition.

In this set-up, volumes as high as 100 Î¼L can be extracted, which is a ten times larger volume than has been reported, earlier. After a feasibility study using the cationic purple dye crystal violet, the method was coupled to LC-MS and large volume cEE of several model peptides was optimized. The cEE-LC-MS method had good repeatability, good linearity and LODs between 0. 5 and 10. nM. The whole procedure was automated and could be used routinely. Finally, the method was applied to plasma analysis and calibration curves of the relevant plasma peptides angiotensin 1 and 2 as well as the fragment angiotensin 2 (3 - 8) showed good linearity and repeatability; LOD values were 10 - 50. nM. Analysis of unspiked plasma resulted in 60 putative endogenous peptides, underlining the great potential of EE as on-line sample concentrating technique.
