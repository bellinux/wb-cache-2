5000|$|Snyder {{proposed}} a [...] "Hope Scale" [...] which considered that a person's determination {{to achieve their}} goal is their measured <b>hope.</b> Snyder differentiates between adult-measured <b>hope</b> and child-measured <b>hope.</b> The Adult <b>Hope</b> Scale by Snyder contains 12 questions; 4 measuring 'pathways thinking', 4 measuring 'agency thinking', and 4 that are simply fillers. Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale. Fibel and Hale measure <b>hope</b> by combining Snyder's <b>Hope</b> Scale with their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure <b>hope.</b> Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one's goals, drawing on tacit {{knowledge of how to}} reach them. Similarly, there is an outlook and a grasp of reality to <b>hope,</b> distinguishing No <b>Hope,</b> Lost <b>Hope,</b> False <b>Hope</b> and Real <b>Hope,</b> which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.|$|R

5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, <b>hoping</b> to emulate {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, <b>hoping</b> to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E

40|$|Nursing {{literature}} {{contains a}} growing number of references to <b>hope.</b> Yet a definition that encapsulates all that <b>hope</b> is and does is not evident in the current health care literature. This paper therefore focuses on the factors of <b>hope</b> and their interrelation in an attempt to meet Walker and Avant 2 ̆ 7 s (1988) first stage of theory production, concept analysis. To this end the paper examines the philosophical background and origin of <b>hope.</b> It critiques <b>hope</b> within health care literature, identifying the centrality of <b>hope,</b> the future orientation of <b>hope,</b> the dynamism of <b>hope,</b> and the multi-dimensional nature of <b>hope.</b> It then explores how <b>hope</b> is relative to help, and examines the relationship between the interwoven concepts of <b>hope,</b> help and caring. It concludes by producing a working definition of <b>hope</b> upon which higher levels of theory, especially future theories of <b>hope</b> inspiration may be based...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hope</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness are important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> is notable since <b>hope</b> is fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place <b>hope</b> at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> is and what it is not. What <b>hope</b> is not is constant. <b>Hope</b> is not optimism; <b>hope</b> is not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> is not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> is from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate <b>hope</b> into economic analysis, consider what implications <b>hope</b> has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> is implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics. <b>Hope,</b> rational choice, goal orientation, expectations, faith...|$|R
