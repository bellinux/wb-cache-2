500|$|By then, Rodham {{was viewed}} as someone with a bright {{political}} future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.

After failing the District of Columbia bar exam and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, [...] "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head". She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter.
