The mean strength can be computed from this distribution and, as it turns out, its plot is identical with the plot of Eq. 5 seen in Fig. 2g.

Based on the observation of a 10 -year old (2007 to 2017) R. patma – T. leucostaphylum graft, we hypothesize that R. patma moves away from its host rather than remaining in an anchored position from which it flowers, although flower knobs that emerge later may vary in range from the <b>grafting</b> <b>point,</b> i. e., flower knobs may develop close to or {{far away from the}} <b>grafting</b> <b>point.</b> Our provisional macroscopic observations point towards a gradual creeping motion of the endophyte towards new host tissues, flowering opportunistically when sufficient nutrients have been found.

Once grafted buds begin to open, the wildstock’s branches are gradually shortened in order to eliminate some of the consumption of nutrients by this one and thus lead the sap to the graft (Rubţov, 1958).

40|$|The {{structural}} phase {{behavior of}} polymer brushes, single-component linear homopolymers grafted onto a planar substrate, is studied using the molecular Monte Carlo method in 3 dimensions. When simulation {{parameters of the}} system are set in regions of macrophase separation of solution for the corresponding non-grafted homopolymers, the grafted polymers also prefer segregation. However, macrophase separation is disallowed due to the spatially-fixed <b>grafting</b> <b>points</b> of the polymers. Such constraints on the grafting are similar to connecting points between blocks of non-grafted diblock copolymers at the microphase separation in the melt state. This results in "microphase separation" of the homopolymer brush in the lateral direction of the substrate.

30|$|In this perspective, it is {{interesting}} to note that even if all efforts to gently treat the lungs were adopted and physiological endpoints were successfully pursued during donor treatment and after transplantation, there was a clear activation of inflammation in the lung [48, 49]. In a clinical setting, achievement of these physiological parameters at the end of donor or recipient treatment would be certainly satisfactory. However, in spite of this excellent clinical outcome, enhanced expression of the chemokines CCL 2 -MCP- 1 and IL- 8 as well as increased transcription of SELE at different phases of the transplantation process suggest the presence of an inflammatory reaction [50]. Of particular interest, increased expression of IL- 8 occurred during donor management. This observation confirms the idea that brain death per se induces inflammation in peripheral organs [51, 52]. Indeed, increased production of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL- 8 after brain death can facilitate subsequent reperfusion injury. In addition, increased chemokine production at the <b>Graft</b> <b>point</b> can promote rejection. Of note, our reperfusion strategy protected against oxidative injury, as suggested by HMGB- 1 downregulation [53, 54].|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} new technologies, {{including}} new-generation biomaterials and chromatography resins, are based on passivation and modification of surfaces by terminally attaching polymer chains to the surface. However, {{little is known about}} these systems at the molecular level. In this work the compression of a single end-grafted polymer chain (or mushroom) by a disc of finite radius was investigated using a self-consistent field (SCF) lattice model. In accordance with results predicted using scaling theory [Subramanian et al., Europhys. Lett. 29 (1995) 285 and Macromolecules 29 (1996) 4045], the compressed chain undergoes a smooth escape transition. However, under the assumption of angular symmetry, a first-order escape transition of the end-grafted chain is not observed, suggesting that the formation of a tether is required for the predicted phase transition. Segment density distributions and compression energies are calculated in a cylindrical lattice. The energy required to compress a chain increases monotonically as the disc is moved closer to the surface and becomes independent of chain length at strong compressions where the work of compression involves only confinement of the tether joining the escaped chain fraction to the <b>grafting</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} modelling of {{a flexible}} comb copolymer with attractive {{interactions between the}} monomer units of the side chains is performed. The conditions for the coil-globule transition, induced by the increase of attractive interaction, ε, between side chain monomer units, are analysed for different values {{of the number of}} monomer units in the backbone, N, in the side chains, n, and between successive <b>grafting</b> <b>points,</b> m. It is shown that the coil-globule transition of such a copolymer corresponds to a first-order phase transition. The energy of attraction (ε) required for the realisation of the coil-globule transition decreases with increasing n and decreasing m. The coil-globule transition is accompanied by significant aggregation of side chain units. The resulting globule has a complex structure. In the case of a relatively short backbone (small value of N), the globule consists of a spherical core formed by side chains and an enveloping shell formed by the monomer units of the backbone. In the case of long copolymers (large value of N), the side chains form several spherical micelles while the backbone is wrapped on the surfaces of these micelles and between them. ...|$|R

Parameters like screw rotation rate, fully filled {{length of the}} extruder, wall temperature and throughput have been varied {{in order to obtain}} information about their influence on conversion, graft percentages and molecular weight of the materials formed. To increase the amount of <b>graft</b> <b>points,</b> maleic acid anhydride (MAH) was added resulting in an increased grafting of polystyrene onto starch. Graft percentages of 60 % could be achieved. The total conversion of styrene could be controlled by adjusting extruder parameters like barrel temperature, fully filled length and initiator type. Conversions of 95 % were found. Molecular weights of the polystyrene formed could be controlled by adding a chain transfer agent (dodecylmercaptan) to the styrene phase. In this way the molecular weight (Mn) of the styrenic part could be varied from 20, 000 to 140, 000. The experiments with the chain transfer agent showed that the grafting of polystyrene onto starch is a process occurring at the interface between the dissolved starch and the styrene phase. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Amphiphilic, monolayer-protected gold {{nanoparticles}} (AuNPs) {{have recently}} been shown to insert into and fuse with lipid bilayers, driven by the hydrophobic effect. The inserted transmembrane state is stabilized by the “snorkeling ” of charged ligand end groups out of the bilayer interior. This snorkeling process is facilitated by the backbone flexibility of the alkanethiol ligands that comprise the monolayer. In this work, we show that fusion is favorable {{even in the absence}} of backbone flexibility by modeling the ligands as rigid rods. For rigid ligands, snorkeling is still accommodated by rotations of the ligand with respect to the <b>grafting</b> <b>point,</b> but the process incurs a more significant free energy penalty than if the backbone were fully flexible. We show that the rigid rod model predicts similar trends in the free energy change for insertion as the previous flexible model when the size of the AuNPs is varied. However, the rigidity of the ligand backbone reduces the overall magnitude of the free energy change compared to that of the flexible model. These results thus generalize previous findings to systems with hindered backbone flexibility due to either structural constraints or low temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of a single}} chain tethered to an interface and in contact with a cross-linked network is examined numerically. When the network is put {{in contact with the}} tethered chain, the chain moves with dynamics that are highly constrained due to entanglements.

Macro and micronutrients were mostly concentrated in roots, followed by variety and rootstock, irrespective of the species. Independently of the tissue, macronutrients concentration hierarchy was N>Ca>K> P>Mg>S. Removed N by whole tree accounted for 6. 58, 3. 53 and 2. 49 g tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively, corresponding to almost 200, 107 and 100 kg N ha – 1, respectively. High amounts of K and Ca were used by pear (130 - 140 kg ha – 1) and apple trees (~ 50 and 130 kg ha – 1 of K and Ca, respectively), while ~ 25 kg K ha – 1 and 55 kg Ca ha – 1 were calculated for cherry nursery trees. Among micronutrients, Fe was the most required (~ 3 kg ha – 1) independently of the species. B removal ranged between 1. 2 and 2. 4 kg ha – 1 (80, 40 and 30 mg tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively), whereas Mn, Cu and Zn accounted for few hundred g ha – 1, irrespective of the species. Given that nutrient concentration among tissues resulted within the same order of magnitude, irrespective of the species, differences in removal were mainly driven by the tree biomass as proved by the significant correlations between plant dry biomass with most of the nutrients we observed...|$|E
40|$|A {{polymer chain}} near a {{penetrable}} interface is {{studied in the}} Gaussian model, in the lattice random walk model and by a scaling analysis. The interface is modeled as an external potential u of a Heaviside step-function form. One end of the chain is fixed at a distance z 0 away from this interface. When the end point is fixed in the high potential region, a first-order coil-to-flower transition takes place upon variation of the distance z 0. Here, the flower has a strongly stretched stem from the <b>grafting</b> <b>point</b> towards the interface and, on top of it, a crown composed of the remaining segments in a (perturbed) coil conformation. The coil-to-flower transition is analyzed {{in terms of the}} Landau free energy. The order parameter is taken {{to be related to the}} fraction of segments residing in the energetically favorable region. Exact analytical expressions for the Landau function are obtained in the Gaussian model for any distances z 0 and potential strength u. A phase diagram in the z 0 versus u coordinates is constructed. It contains a line of the first-order phase transitions (binodal line) ending at a critical point z 0 = u = 0, and two spinodal lines. Numerical results are obtained for several chain lengths in the lattice random walk model demonstrating the effects of finite extensibility on the position of the transition point. Excluded volume effects are analyzed within the scaling approach. ? 2001 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Mandarins {{have become}} {{increasingly}} valued as citrus fruits for the fresh market due to the easy peeling, attractive flavor, and health and nutritional properties. Plant growth and yield, and characteristics of fruits of 'Okitsu' Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) trees grafted on nine rootstocks were evaluated in Londrina, northern Paraná, Brazil. The rootstocks were: 'Rangpur' lime (Citrus limonia Osb.); 'Cleopatra' (Citrus reshni hort. ex Tanaka) and 'Sunki' mandarins (Citrus sunki hort. ex Tanaka); 'C- 13 ' [Citrus sinensis × Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] and 'Carrizo' citranges [C. sinensis × P. trifoliata (L.) Raf. ]; 'Volkamer' lemon (Citrus volkameriana V. Ten. & Pasq.); trifoliate orange [P. trifoliata (L.) Raf.; 'Caipira DAC' sweet orange [C. sinensis (L.) Osb. ] and 'Swingle' citrumelo [Citrus paradisi Macfad. cv. Duncan × P. trifoliata (L.) Raf. ]. The highest plant growth was for the trees on 'Cleopatra' mandarin and 'Caipira DAC' sweet orange. In contrast, the smallest size was for the trees on 'Volkamer' lemon and trifoliate orange. The largest difference between the trunk diameter below and above the <b>grafting</b> <b>point</b> was induced by 'Swingle' citrumelo. Trees of 'Okitsu' Satsuma mandarin on 'Swingle' citrumelo presented the highest yield, while 'C- 13 ', 'Carrizo', 'Sunki', and 'Swingle' induced the largest fruit masses. With regard to fruit characteristics, 'Carrizo' and trifoliate orange induced the best ratio and juice content. Based on theoretical values, 'Rangpur' lime and 'Volkamer' lemon induced the lowest yield...|$|E
