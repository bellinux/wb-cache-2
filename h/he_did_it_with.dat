Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, such as {{at a meeting in}} Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E

He assisted Britain's ultimate success in the war through his early decisions on national mobilisation; the despatch of the British Expeditionary Force to the Western Front, the creation of a mass army, and the development of an industrial strategy designed to support the country's war aims.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, the fact that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E

Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, {{in response to the}} tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the {{activities}} of the poster designer, the printmaker, the illustrator, and the film director have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} Hitler pathographies comes from the neurologist and psychiatrist Frederick Redlich. Redlich, who emigrated from Austria in 1938 to the United States, {{is considered one of}} the founders of American social psychiatry. In his 1998 published work Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet, on which he worked for 13 years, Redlich came to believe that Hitler had indeed shown enough paranoia and defense mechanisms in order to ”fill a psychiatric textbook with it”, but that he was probably not mentally disturbed. Hitler’s paranoid delusions ”could be seen as symptoms of a mental disorder, but the largest part of the personality worked normal.” Hitler ”knew what he was doing and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> pride and enthusiasm.” ...|$|E
