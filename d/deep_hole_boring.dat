40|$|Abstract: Modern {{injection}} molds are high technology tools {{that are used}} for mass production. Typically, the products have to meet high quality demands, because they are often directly visible to the user. In order to manufacture high quality parts, {{the temperature of the}} mold has to be kept at an appropriate level and the temperature has to be equally distributed in the form. A net of interconnected <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>bores</b> leads a water-oil-emulsion into the critical areas to control the temperatures in the tool. Today, the layout of the bores is often still constructed by heuristic means. In this article an objective mathematical measure for the multi-objective quality of a mold temperature control systems is introduced. Two different encoding approaches of cooling systems are given. An approach to solve the complex layout problem using an evolutionary algorithm is described. In oder to show the complexity of this multi-objective problem and to interpret and compare the quality of the existing algorithms, a new software environment called KEA (Kit for Evolutionary Algorithms) is used.

40|$|Cement-based {{materials}} {{for use as}} sealants in underground waste storages must be erosion-resistant and chemically stable. Placement of highly radioactive waste (HLW) in boreholes may require that the rock is cement-grouted and stabilized by constructing concrete plugs. Where smectitic clay seals are in contact with concrete there is mutual degradation, and low-pH cement with inorganic superplasticizers, like talc, are recommended for preparing the concrete. This paper reviews our current state-of-knowledge concerning the grout and concrete sealing very deep boreholes (DBD) for purpose of high-level radioactive waste disposal. In this concept, the lower 2  km section of 4  km <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> <b>bored</b> in crystalline rock could host waste-containers while the upper parts are sealed by dense clay and concrete. 1  The parts of such a hole that intersect fracture-poor rock are sealed with dense expandable clay while concrete is cast where fracture zones are intersected.

In our previous studies, we found that the odor content of commercial dried products was too weak for most people, and that the odorous compound content could be increased by adding amino acids to sawdust media. Currently, however, bed-log cultivation is used to produce fruiting bodies for dried products. The purpose of this study was to fi nd a method to increase the content of odorous compounds in dried products cultivated on bed logs. Pressure injection of amino acids from the side of the bed log was the most effi cient method, but it had some problems. Hence, a simpler and less troublesome method was developed, i.e., injecting amino acid solution from small bottles set in <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> <b>bored</b> in the sides of the bed logs. In fruiting bodies cultivated on bed logs injected with amino acid solution by the improved method, the mean contents of lentinic acid, a precursor of the odorous compound lenthionine, approximately doubled compared to that in the untreated logs, although the infi ltration area of the solution injected by the improved method was smaller than that by the former method.|$|R

40|$|Need for {{increased}} productivity has motivated interest in drilling equipment for high speed and high precision drilling. However, long drills exhibit aggressive and self-excited vibrations known as whirling motions. These vibrations deteriorate the outcome drilled surface qualities, i. e., finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerances. <b>Deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> {{is the most}} complex and expensive drilling operation in terms of expertise needed, operating conditions and size. The present research is to study the whirling vibrations of the boring bar workpiece system in the BTA <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> process. After {{a review of the}} literature, a set of objectives is outlined for the thesis. The objectives are to formulate an analytical model, which will include the self-excited motion caused by the internal cutting forces in the Z and Y directions and the active suppression forces used to counteract the cutting forces. This model will be used to carry out simulation studies on the whirling vibrations of the boring bar-workpiece system and to carry out some experiments in order to validate the analytical model. In view of the large number of machining parameters that influence the system dynamics and the resulting surface finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing on the workpiece, a fuzzy logic model is proposed for off line modeling. Such a model will be used to examine the results obtained in the experiments and to predict the best parametric combinations that will provide the required surface finish. This will constitute an open loop control of the vibrations. An active vibration suppression is carried out to reduce the whirling motion of the boring bar-workpiece system, which in turn will improve the surface finish. Two electrodynamic shakers are used in Z-Y plane to overcome the displacement of the boring bar while drilling. The experimental investigations are carried out in the <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> laboratory. Instrumentation involving proximity pickups, oscillator, amplifiers and demodulator are used to measure the displacement response and the orbital motion of the boring bar-workpiece system, and two electrodynamic shakers to suppress the motion.

40|$|Multibarrier {{systems are}} {{commonly}} proposed for effective isolation of highly radioactive waste (HLW). Presently considered concepts take the host rock {{as a barrier}} claiming it to retard migration of possibly released radionuclides from HLW containers to the biosphere. This capacity is small unless water-bearing fracture zones intersecting the blasted waste-containing tunnels and excavation-disturbance zones around them can be sealed by grouting and construction of bulkheads, but this is effective only for a very limited period of time as explained in the paper. The disturbed zones thence make the entire repository serve as a continuous hydraulic conductor causing quick transport of released radionuclides up to the biosphere. The dilemma can be solved by accepting the short-circuiting function of the disturbed zones along the tunnels {{on the condition that}} totally tight waste containers be used. <b>Deep</b> <b>holes</b> <b>bored</b> in the site selection phase through the forthcoming repository can be effective pathways for radionuclides unless they are properly sealed. They are small-scale equivalents of tunnels but do not have any ex-cavation damage and can be effectively sealed by using clay and concrete of new types.

40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{high strength}} and performance-orientated materials contribute to enhance component properties {{and to improve}} resource efficiency. Consequently, these materials are constantly in demand and used more and more frequently in challenging applications. Within this context, high-strength bainitic steels as well as high temperature proof nickel based alloys are two of these material groups which are focused increasingly by automotive, aerospace and other applications sectors. The excellent material properties are linked to a sophisticated machining ability. Nevertheless, an economical manufacturing is an essential requirement to exploit the full potential {{of the use of}} high strength bainitic steels and high temperature-proof nickel based alloys. Therefore, it is absolutely indispensable to adopt and optimize existing manu¬facturing technologies. The research activities described in this thesis focus on the production of <b>deep</b> <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> with smallest diameters and high length to diameter ratios based on mechanical processes. However, additional difficulties arise when single lip and twist <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling with smallest tool diameters are applied. Mentionable examples are very low tool rigidities, high mechanical tool loads owing to the limitedly realizable feed rates and the subsequently strong material squeezing and friction in the rounding of the cutting edge as well as the complicated chip removal through the small cross-sections of the chip flutes. In order to encounter the material and process specific challenges and to achieve a stable and productive <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling, a determined tool and process design for both materials is carried out. In the course of the experimental investigations the influence of the cutting data, the tool design with respect to the cutting tip design, the tool coating composition and the coating thickness as well as the cooling lubricant in single lip <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling is evaluated. Furthermore, a comparison of single lip and twist <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling shows the advantages and disad¬vantages of both manufacturing processes. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanical tool loads, chip formation, tool wear and <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> quality regarding the dimension and form tolerances as well as the surface quality is made to evaluate the various influencing variables. Additionally, a newly developed methodology of analysis allows a closer look on the chip formation at the corresponding cutting edges and the chip removal along the chip flutes in smallest diameter <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling for the very first time. Here, samples made of the particular test materials are inserted in transparent acrylic glass carriers and the chip formation in the operating zone is documented by high speed microscopy. At the same time, the findings of this high speed chip formation analysis contribute to a substantial increase in fundamental process knowledge. A concluding comparison of the representative process characteristics and the technological correlations in <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> drilling of high strength bainitic steels and high temperature proof nickel based alloys with smallest diameters clarifies the significantly divergent tribological application behavior. The differing mechanisms of tool wear as well as the related wear forms result in very individual and particular requirements on an efficient tool and process design.

The prototypical problem of reduced cleaning efficiency inside <b>deep</b> <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is studied with modular 3 D test substrates containing <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> of different depths. The design of the substrates allows for a simplified access of surface diagnostic techniques to measure the mass removal depending on the aspect ratio of cavities.

Gravimetric and profilometric measurements are presented and the effect of process parameters (power, pressure, pulse duration, and gas mixture) on the removal rate of organic material from the surface is illuminated. Within the conditions under investigation pressures between 10 and 20 Pa lead to optimum results for an aspect ratio of 16. 7 and absolute depths of 100 mm. While higher pressures lead to better cleaning at the surface, the removal diminishes greatly in deeper trenches, however, the cleaning efficiency in depth regions below 30 mm can be enhanced by choosing proper treatment parameters. The results suggest that the cleaning process under these conditions is dominated by chemical surface reactions and the transport of reactive species in the holes is strongly influenced by losses due to wall reactions...|$|R

As a cheaply available geophysical technique, ground resistivity measurement was also used to measure the temperature. Increasing temperature again increases their resistance. This natural phenomenon has been used to develop a methodology to assess the geothermal potential in various countries. Resistivity surveys have been carried out in various places in Sri Lanka. Gathered resistivity data has been analyzed. Geothermal gradient calculation was done in Bogala Graphite Mines to study about the temperature gradient in Sri Lanka. Also this selected place was far away from hot spring areas and hence those hot springs had no influence to the collected data. This method is suitable to find temperature gradient of Sri Lanka. The average values of temperatures in those levels were computed and then geothermal gradient was calculated which is 28. 0460 C/km. This method gave some reliable information as to how the temperature gradient varies at crustal level of rocks in Sri Lanka. To calculate power generation, a laboratory model was developed with the possibility of applying varying parameters. Collected the annual average temperature data and predicted the temperature gradient of various districts. According to the calculations done, geothermal gradient in Sri Lanka is varying between 23 0 C and 30 0 C per km. This information has been used to develop the geothermal map of Sri Lanka.
