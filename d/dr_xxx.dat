50|$|The Mad Doctor (also {{known as}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>XXX)</b> {{is a human}} mad {{scientist}} who serves as an infrequent antagonist of Mickey's. He first appeared in his self-titled short, in which he attempted to operate on Pluto by attaching his body {{to that of a}} chicken; this entire sequence {{turned out to be a}} dream. Many years later, he served as a major antagonist in both Epic Mickey games.|$|E
5000|$|The plot {{centers on}} the title character, a mad {{scientist}} named <b>Dr.</b> <b>XXX,</b> who has kidnapped Mickey's dog, Pluto. Mickey tries to rescue him before the doctor can perform his experiment: putting Pluto's head {{to the body of}} a chicken in order to see if a puppy will hatch from an egg (that is if the end result will [...] "bark or crow or cackle"). Mickey battles his way through booby traps and animated skeletons before eventually getting caught and strapped onto a table to get cut open by a buzzsaw, forcing Mickey to suck in his belly, trembling. The scene then fades to Mickey asleep in bed and suddenly woken up by a fly, whose buzzing resembles the whirring of the spinning blade. Not yet realizing the events were only a nightmare, Mickey shouts for Pluto, who eagerly jumps onto Mickey's bed with his doghouse and chain still attached to collar.|$|E
