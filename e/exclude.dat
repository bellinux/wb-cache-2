5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to <b>exclude</b> the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can <b>exclude</b> a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} locally <b>excluded</b> minors. Graph classes locally <b>excluding</b> a minor are a common generalisation {{of the concept of}} <b>excluded</b> minor classes and of graph classes with bounded local tree-width. We show that first-order model-checking is fixedparameter tractable on any class of graphs locally <b>excluding</b> a minor. This strictly generalises analogous results by Flum and Grohe on <b>excluded</b> minor classes and Frick and Grohe on classes with bounded local tree-width. As an important consequence of the proof we obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for problems such as dominating or independent set on graph classes <b>excluding</b> a minor, where now the parameter is the size of the dominating set and the <b>excluded</b> minor. We also study graph classes with <b>excluded</b> minors, where the minor may grow slowly with the size of the graphs and show that again, first-order model-checking is fixed-parameter tractable on any such class of graphs...|$|R
