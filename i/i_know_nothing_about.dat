500|$|Underground {{magazine}} {{were also}} enthusiastic: [...] "This month I'm pleased to say, what's really moving is entirely British. The best groove {{so far this}} year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done, a one-sided, one-track 12inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{far back}} as his time at Wadham College, Fry had been {{interested}} in politics, but admitted: [...] "I take {{a great interest in}} heaps of things that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about...</b> politics for one".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--you won't find 'em. <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> 'em, in course, except {{just what}} I'm told. You know {{my line of}} life, Mr. 'Oward?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Herbert first {{entertained the}} thought of {{standing}} for Parliament {{a few weeks before}} the 1935 general election, when he ran into Frederick Lindemann, who had just been rejected as the Conservative candidate for Oxford University. Herbert decided to stand as an Independent candidate, aided by Frank Pakenham who served as his election agent. Herbert wrote an [...] "unconventional", 5,000-word-long election address, which included: [...] "Agriculture: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> agriculture." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{leaders of}} anti-communist opinion inside the former Eastern Bloc, invited by President Băsescu the Final Report reading, Lech Wałęsa and Vladimir Bukovsky had been {{requested}} by Ziua {{to comment on}} the Commission's activities. When asked if he knew Tismăneanu, Wałęsa replied [...] "No, I don't know, I don't have such a good memory", while Bukovsky stated [...] "I don't know Tismăneanu, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> him. I would like people to understand what they did in the past. He too should understand the part he played".|$|E
2500|$|As Zhu was (outwardly) {{preparing}} to leave Jiangdu, Xu Zhixun went to bid him farewell. [...] Zhu held a feast for him, offered him wine, had Zhu's favorite concubine come outside to greet him and sing for him, and presented Zhu's favorite horse {{as a gift to}} him. [...] Zhu then invited him into the middle of Zhu's mansion, where Zhu's wife Lady Tao came out to greet him as well as a sign of respect. [...] Xu Zhixun was pleased and took no further precautions, while Zhu already had his elite guards surround the hall. [...] As Lady Tao bowed to Xu Zhixun and he bowed back, Zhu struck him and, as he fell to the ground, Zhu's elite soldiers entered and cut off his head. [...] After Zhu took the head and showed them to Xu Zhixun's soldiers, they all fled. [...] Zhu then entered the palace and showed the head to Yang, stating, [...] "I, your servant, have removed a harm to Your Majesty." [...] However, Yang, in fear of the consequences, fled and stated, [...] "You, Uncle, take care of yourself! [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> this." [...] (Yang referred to Zhu as uncle because Yang Xingmi's first wife Lady Zhu had the same surname, although she was unrelated to Zhu Jin.) [...] Shortly after, Zhu was cornered by soldiers under Xu Wen's associate Zhai Qian (翟虔), and committed suicide.|$|E

2500|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour, travelling to England aboard the Orcades after leaving Australia in late March. They almost {{did so with}} their three main bowlers marooned in an Italian jail. During a stopover at Naples on the sea voyage to England, Miller had taken Lindwall and Johnston to watch a rehearsal of La Boheme at the Teatro di San Carlo. The trio ignored the doorkeeper's attempt to stop them attending what {{was meant to be}} a private rehearsal, and proceeded inside to the auditorium. When they attempted to return to the boat, they found that the doorkeeper had locked them inside and called the police. Lindwall broke the door's lock and the pacemen ran back to the dock just before the gangplank was being pulled away. The Australians arrived at Southampton after four weeks at sea. He was embroiled in further controversy when Bumper, a book that he had produced with his ghost-writer Dick Whitington, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious. The book commented that [...] "Hassett deals, or fails to deal with things as they occur". Early on the tour, the Evening News ran the headline [...] "Keith Miller Criticises his Captain". The poker-faced Hassett kept his cool at a welcome reception hosted by the Journalists' Association, introducing Miller to the guests by saying [...] "There is Keith Miller, whom you all know well. I hear he has written a book. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> class struggle, {{conscious}} race prejudice, economic royalists, or maladjusted personalities. Everything dark {{was simple}} as sin, and men needed only to repent and be saved {{in order to}} set everything right.|$|R
6000|$|But Gertrude only repeated, [...] "I {{shall never}} see you again. I shall never hear of you," [...] she went on. [...] "I shall <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> you. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> you before, {{and it will}} be the same again." ...|$|R
