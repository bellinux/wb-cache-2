40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{isolation}} of cells from rabbit kidney proximal tubules {{by using an}} intracellular-like solution (ICS) and gentle mechanical agitation {{in the absence of}} enzymes or chelators is described. Metabolic and functional characteristics of these cells were studied after washing and resuspension in modified Hanks medium, and the results were compared with those obtained <b>in</b> cells similarly <b>prepared</b> <b>in</b> extra-cellular-like solution (ECS). Trypan Blue exclusion and protein content were not different between the two preparations. However, oxygen consumption, ATP content and time- and concentration-dependent rates of uptake of phosphate, alpha-methyl glucoside and L-alanine were severalfold higher <b>in</b> cells <b>prepared</b> <b>in</b> ICS. Na+-dependent uptake of these solutes was 95 % and 80 % of total uptake <b>in</b> cells <b>prepared</b> <b>in</b> ICS and ECS respectively. Maximum transport rates (Tmax.) of phosphate, alpha-methyl glucoside and L-alanine were significantly higher <b>in</b> cells <b>prepared</b> <b>in</b> ICS. We propose that the use of ICS in the isolation procedure would yield a functionally more viable cell preparation, and therefore provides an ideal model for transport and metabolic studies at a cellular level...|$|R
40|$|This study {{characterized}} {{the accuracy of}} estimating calories of prepared, healthy meals, with the specific hypothesis that individuals with greater body dissatisfaction will overestimate calorie content. Ninety-eight individuals estimated the number of calories in 4 separate healthy meals.

Subjects, regardless of sex, weight status, and body image, tended to overestimate the number of calories <b>in</b> <b>prepared,</b> healthy meals.

40|$|Public {{speaking}} {{anxiety is}} becoming the common problem which is faced by students. In fact, it is known while the students are performing public speaking. State vocational high school 1 Lamongan often participated public speaking competition, but the result of participating some competition, the students need to improve skill in public speaking as teacher’s interview result. Thus, public speaking program was held by the teacher as cooperation by SMKN 1 Lamongan and UIN Sunan Ampel Surabaya. By the case, therefore, it needs analyzing way to know the students’ readiness before performing speech by analyzing students’ self-efficacy <b>in</b> performing <b>prepared</b> speech. Prepared speech is one of public speaking’s types. This study focused on identifying students’ self-efficacy level <b>in</b> <b>prepared</b> speech, identifying factors influencing students’ self-efficacy <b>in</b> <b>prepared</b> speech and identifying teacher’s strategy in improving students’ self-efficacy <b>in</b> <b>prepared</b> speech. The researcher determines this study as qualitative case study using descriptive approach. The participates were from nineteen students of eleventh and twelfth grade. To answer the research problems, the researcher uses interview and questionnaire as the techniques to achieve the aims of this study. The result of this study shows that there are eight students who are in high level, six students in moderate level and five students in low level. The factors which influence students’ self-efficacy <b>in</b> <b>prepared</b> speech are performing speech experience, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and emotional state. There are also new factors which become the first factor influencing students’ self-efficacy. Those are confidence, ability, doubt {{and do not have}} any experience. Then, to improve students’ self-efficacy, the teacher used plan moderately challenging task, use peer models, affective strategy, social strategy and fun learning strategy...|$|R

He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football.
