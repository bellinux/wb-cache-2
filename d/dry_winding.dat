50|$|The {{impregnated}} tows {{are then}} literally wound around a mandrel (mold core) {{in a controlled}} pattern to form {{the shape of the}} part. After winding, the resin is then cured, typically using heat. The mold core may be removed or may be left as an integral component of the part(Rosato, D.V.).This process is primarily used for hollow, generally circular or oval sectioned components, such as pipes and tanks. Pressure vessels, pipes and drive shafts have all been manufactured using filament winding. It has been combined with other fiber application methods such as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Compaction is through fiber tension and resin content is primarily metered. The fibers may be impregnated with resin before winding (wet winding), pre-impregnated (<b>dry</b> <b>winding)</b> or post-impregnated. Wet winding has the advantages of using the lowest cost materials with long storage life and low viscosity. The pre-impregnated systems produce parts with more consistent resin content and can often be wound faster.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe design {{procedure}} of nongeodesic filament wound products requires well-determined {{values for the}} available friction situated between the applied roving and the supporting surface. In this paper, we propose a mandrel shape with a specially designed meridian profile that enables a linearly proportional relation between the feed eye carriage translation and the measured values for the coefficients of friction. As {{a result of this}} property, the optically or chronometrically obtained measurements can directly be translated into coefficients of friction. Additional features of this approach are the high accuracy, repeatability, low experimental costs, and simple machine control strategies. With the proposed mandrel, we performed several experiments corresponding to the variation of typical filament winding-related process parameters: fiber speed, roving tension, roving dimensions, wet versus <b>dry</b> <b>winding,</b> and surface quality of the mandrel. The results indicate that the surface quality of the mandrel and the type of winding process (wet vs. dry fibers) have a considerable influence on the obtained data. The influence of the fiber speed, roving tension, and fiber material on the other hand, is negligible...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In the work, {{there was}} {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} an application of long-fibrous composite material as a based material for prototype of oesophageal prosthesis (tubular element) with the use of so called arms, using coiling, plaiting and winding techniques. Design/methodology/approach: Coiling, plaiting and winding techniques were used. As a reinforcement, aramid fibres bound with different types of so called silicone rubbers. Selection of winding parameters has been made in order to fabrication of prosthesis with appropriate mechanical parameters. Findings: Technological tests have given promising results. In the summary, comments and technological remarks are described. For prototype of prosthesis manufacturing, components, which in the form of composite materials are characterized by biocompatibility, have been used, that is medical silicone and aramid fibres. Research limitations/implications: The pilot investigation of fabricated prototypes of internal oesophageal prosthesis show {{that it is necessary to}} change the fabrication technology onto <b>dry</b> <b>winding</b> followed by closing obtained reinforcement in a mould and saturation with silicone. The idea is to get better silicone content and connected with it better elasticity and tightness of the prosthesis. Originality/value: Accepted method of winding is the most effective due to fabrication of prototypes of internal oesophageal prosthesis in laboratory. In industry, probably the better method will be plaiting, e. g. : as in the case of high-pressure hose of applied hydraulics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Central Solenoid (CS) stack {{consists}} of six modules, 2. 1 m tall each [1]. In order to verify good impregnation, {{we performed a}} vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) test of a full {{cross section of the}} CS module (CSM), 40 conductors tall and 14 conductors wide [2]. It was discovered that after preparation of the full cross section stack until completion of the VPI, the stack shrunk in height by 20 - 25 mm. Our study of the literature and discussions with the leading experts in VPI did not reveal obvious reasons for this change of height, so we launched a study to address this issue. We assembled two 12 x 1 (tall by wide) arrays and several 7 x 1 arrays in order to study characteristics of the <b>dry</b> <b>winding</b> pack under compressive force and effects of different fabrication steps. Then we impregnated these arrays in different conditions under compressive force and studied change of height as a result of compression, impregnation, gelling and curing of the stack of insulated conductors. We showed that by controlling the application of the compressive force, before closing the mold and during impregnation, one can reduce the height uncertainty. Most of the height reduction takes place while the glass is dry under the dead weight and the applied compressive force. Reduction of height during injection of the resin and during gelling, curing and cooling of the coil is noticeable, reproducible and relatively small. The paper presents results of our studies and recommendations for assembly and VPI of tall windings...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} paper {{of this series}} the more {{important}} available fossils from the Rio Chico Formation were described, figured, and, as far as new and definable, named. In the present paper the various fossil localities are enumerated, sufficient stratigraphic data given to specify the geologic provenience of the fossils as exactly as possible, the mam-mals found at each horizon and locality listed, and the general relation-ships and probable age of the fauna summarized.

CANADON HONDO Cafiad 6 n Hondo is a valley, or more descriptively a nearly circular erosional basin, with a <b>dry,</b> <b>winding</b> watercourse which empties into the Rio Chico del Chubut immediately above Paso Niemann. The stratigraphy here is very complex and extraordinary and its study is complicated by much pre-Patagonian (but post-Casamayor or later) faulting and local folding, by much slumping of the beds {{in the bottom of the}} basin, and the peculiar lithological facies which include several types of rocks not seen by us in these formations at any other locality. The very irregular valley or basin bottom has exposures in almost all parts, but a complete section cannot be traced because of rapid lateral lithologic changes, faulting and slumping, and frequent local lack of exposure at crucial points in the series. Short of a detailed topographic and geologic survey, beyond the possibilities of our own work, a defini-tive arrangement of this complex series is not possible, in fact absolute certainty on many points seems unobtainable by any method. The broad sequence which seems probable from our own observa-tions is as follows, beginning with the oldest beds: 1.

Hot and <b>dry</b> <b>wind</b> conditions temporarily reduced panicle water potential to – 0. 65 MPa; however, kernel growth was maintained by osmotic adjustment at control levels with increased transport of assimilate to the growing kernels. Dynamic tracer analysis with a nano-electrospray-ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometer and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that starch degradation was negligible in the short-term treatment. Overall expression of starch synthesis-related genes was found to be down-regulated at moderately low water potential. Because the events observed at low water potential preceded the packing of starch granules in cells, we concluded that reduced rates of starch biosynthesis {{play a central role in}} the events of cellular metabolism that are altered at osmotic adjustment, which leads to chalky ring formation under short-term hot and <b>dry</b> <b>wind</b> conditions.
