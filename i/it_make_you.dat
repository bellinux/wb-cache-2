500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel good to see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Mars further {{confessed that}} by the time he started to develop his songwriting skills, he learned his [...] "most {{valuable}} lesson", [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> move? Make you dance? Whether the song is uptempo or a ballad", adding that [...] "there has to be a heartbeat in back of it. There needs to be a pulse in the song". To American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons recalled sleepless nights during the record's process, as the team was trying to prove that the debut album [...] "wasn't a fluke", which according to Lawrence is [...] "the absolute wrong mind-set to be". He went on expressing that the first four or five months they worked on the record were fruitless, because [...] "nothing would stick". When they decided to leave the studio and have a few drinks, they came to conclusion to relax and not put themselves under so much pressure; it resulted in [...] "the ideas [...] coming out again." ...|$|E
500|$|The Honda {{executives}} were intrigued, but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving {{permission to go}} ahead with the full-scale project. [...] "Cog" [...] was approved with a budget of £1million, and Gooden & Walker recruited a London-based team to go through the logistics of the shoot in detail. The team, which comprised engineers, special effects technicians, car designers, and even a sculptor, spent a month working with parts from a disassembled Honda Accord before the design for the advertisement's set was even finalised. Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific [...] Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet was hired to direct the piece. Bardou-Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award-winning music videos, including Alex Gopher's [...] "The Child", Playgroup's [...] "Number One", and Air's [...] "How Does <b>It</b> <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> Feel".|$|E

500|$|Erotica is {{a concept}} album about sex and romance, on which she {{incorporated}} an alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Musically, it is a pop and dance record which incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album played on innuendos and double entendres instead of explicit words. [...] "Erotica" [...] is the opening track from the album. Starting with Madonna saying [...] "My name is Dita", she invites her lover to be passive, while she tells him to [...] "do as I say" [...] and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. It deals with sex hang-ups, and {{has been described as}} [...] "an ode to S". Her cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] follows the title track. It is described as a [...] "sassy, house-style remake" [...] of the pop standard. The third track, [...] "Bye Bye Baby," [...] starts with the declaration, [...] "This is not a love song," [...] and goes on to ask questions of a lover she is about to abandon. At one point, Madonna asks angrily: [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel good to see me cry?" [...] The fourth track from Erotica, [...] "Deeper and Deeper," [...] is described as one of the [...] "pure disco" [...] moments of the album. Its bridge features a flamenco guitar, and its lyrics talk about sexual obsession.|$|E
