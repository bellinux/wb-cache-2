25|$|UCC's {{laboratory}} tests in 1989 revealed that {{soil and water}} samples collected from near the factory were toxic to fish. Twenty-one areas inside the plant were reported to be highly polluted. In 1991 the municipal authorities declared that water from over 100 wells was hazardous for health if used for drinking. In 1994 {{it was reported that}} 21% of the factory premises were seriously contaminated with chemicals. Beginning in 1999, studies made by Greenpeace and others from soil, <b>groundwater,</b> <b>well</b> water and vegetables from the residential areas around UCIL and from the UCIL factory area show contamination with a range of toxic heavy metals and chemical compounds. Substances found, according to the reports, are naphthol, naphthalene, Sevin, tarry residues, alpha naphthol, mercury, organochlorines, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, hexachlorethane, hexachlorobutadiene, pesticide HCH (BHC), volatile organic compounds and halo-organics. Many of these contaminants were also found in breast milk of women living near the area.|$|E

Many Swedish municipals investigates ways to protect water supplies in convention areas.  The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the risks of microbiological contamination {{of drinking water}} by private sewers and geothermal heat pumps. The purpose was also to investigate the risks of contamination associated with safety distances from energy wells and private sewers. Water samples were taken from private <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> in the convention area of Hertsölandet in Luleå municipal, to test for microbiological contamination. To investigate safety distances, maps were made to locate private sewers, private <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> and energy wells in the area. The result indicated that the <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> was not contaminated by wastewater but that individual weaknesses in the <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> contributed to microorganisms in the drinking water. However, too few samples were taken to provide a reliable result. The samples were taken at spring time and it should possibly had been more representative to take the samples after the summer season, when the use of water and production of wastewater has increased. Contaminations associated with safety distances to geothermal heat pumps and other <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> could not be detected. The results shown that several <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> were located too close to sewers according to safety distance.

[...] At a public meeting, when asked why the Navy had installed monitoring wells designed to track the spread of explosive contaminants between the impact area and the civilian area, the ATSDR refused to comment.

40|$|In September 2007, California Fish and Game (CAFG) {{plans to}} {{eradicate}} the northern pike from Lake Davis. As {{a result of the}} eradication treatment, local residents have concerns that the treatment might impact the local groundwater quality. To address the concerns of the residents, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) recommended measuring the naturally occurring stable oxygen isotopes in local <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells,</b> Lake Davis, and the Lake Davis tributaries. The purpose of these measurements is to determine if the source of the local groundwater is either rain/snowmelt, Lake Davis/Big Grizzly Creek water or a mixture of Lake Davis/Big Grizzly Creek and rain/snowmelt. As a result of natural evaporation, Lake Davis and the water flowing into Big Grizzly Creek are naturally enriched in {sup 18 }oxygen ({sup 18 }O), and if a source of a well's water is Lake Davis or Big Grizzly Creek, the well water will contain a much higher concentration of {sup 18 }O. This survey will allow for the identification of <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> whose water source is Lake Davis or Big Grizzly Creek. The results of this survey will be useful {{in the development of a}} water-quality monitoring program for the upcoming Lake Davis treatment. LLNL analyzed 167 <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> (Table 1), 12 monthly samples from Lake Davis (Table 2), 3 samples from Lake Davis tributaries (Table 2), and 8 Big Grizzly Creek samples (Table 2).

5000|$|The Stever is a {{tributary}} of the Lippe which is fed by water out of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and has a huge meaning for drinking water supply for the northern Ruhr region. To balance the whole system the Stever - after being fed out of the canal in Senden - is backed-up in two water reservoirs (Talsperre Hullern and Halterner Stausee) of 32 Mio. m³ capacity. Two-thirds of the Stever flow is discharged downstream; one-third is used by the drinking water supplier Gelsenwasser AG for drinking water processing via soil infiltration from <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> (of all together approximately 129 Mio. m³/year). Additionally the municipal utilities Stadtwerke Münster use water from the Dortmund-Ems Canal to supply the <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells</b> for drinking water processing. In total, via several water works annually 250 Mio. m³ of water are transported in pipework from the Ruhr to the area at the canals. [...] The regionally diversified origin and processing of drinking water - pumped water from Rhine and Ruhr, various <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells,</b> replenishment with infiltrated canal water - guarantees constantly the regional supply with water of highest quality in Ruhr and Münsterland region. Hereby it is also possible in case of calamities (like exceeding threshold values at certain <b>groundwater</b> <b>wells)</b> to substitute the water supply from other sources (like the infiltration of canal water).|$|R

To estimate the extent at which the groundwater levels are influenced by the ocean surface levels, we compute the coherence between them.
