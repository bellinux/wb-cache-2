40|$|Crown {{retention}} {{is related}} to its adaptation with tooth while {{there is always a}} gap between the crown and prepared tooth. Although this <b>gap</b> is <b>filled</b> with <b>cements</b> but the mechanical retention between axial walls and internal surfaces is decreased. Therefore, what is the relation between die spacer and crown retention? Does it affect retention? And if so, what is the best thickness of it? It {{has been a long time}} that various techniques are recommended and used to improve the adaptation of crowns. According to Fusayama and based on some other researches, it can be concluded that by using die spacer we can noticeably decrease the thickness of cement and improve the adaptation of cement. In addition, many studies on thickness and amount of die spacer concluded that by using die spacers, in % 55 of cases crown retention was increased while in 30 % decreased and 10 - 15 % have not changed. Hence, it seems that using die spacer is generally beneficial and the best thickness of it according to our research is 2 - 4 layers that can improve retention by 41 %...|$|R
40|$|Dennis Flanagan Private Practice, Willimantic, CT, USA Abstract: Implant-supported dental {{prostheses}} can be retained by a screw or cement. Implant-supported fixed partial dentures have a passive fit. A passive fit {{means there is}} an internal gap between the abutment surface and the intaglio of the retainer to insure {{that there is no}} lateral pressure on the supporting implants or friction upon seating of the prosthesis. This <b>gap</b> is <b>filled</b> with <b>cement</b> for retention of the prosthesis. Any lateral pressure may cause marginal bone loss or periimplantitis. Also, there is usually a microscopic gap at the margin of a crown retainer that exposes the cement to oral fluids. The solubility of zinc phosphate (ZOP) cement is a definite liability due to the risk for cement dissolution. In fixed prostheses, the dissolution of the cement of one or more retainers would cause a transfer of the occlusal load to the retained unit(s). The resulting rotation and lifting of the cement-retained implants from occlusal and parafunctional loads could cause loss of osseointegration of the abutment-retained implant(s). ZOP cement may not be indicated for implant-supported fixed partial dentures or splints. Cement dissolution in single unit probably only involves re-cementation, if the patient does not swallow or aspirate the crown.

With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, {{there is an}} enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to <b>fill</b> <b>gaps</b> in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approach called likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approaches. We also demonstrate that models <b>gap</b> <b>filled</b> using likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of <b>gap</b> <b>filled</b> models with Biolog and knockout lethality data. This indicates that the phenotype data alone cannot necessarily be used to discriminate between alternative solutions for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> and therefore, that the use of other information is necessary to obtain a more accurate network.

40|$|This Article {{develops}} {{a new standard}} for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> in incomplete contracts. It focuses on an important class of situations in which parties leave their agreement deliberately incomplete, {{with the intent to}} further negotiate and resolve the remaining issues. In these situations, neither the traditional no-enforcement result nor the usual <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approaches accord with the parties' partial consent. Instead, the Article develops the concept of pro-defendant gap-fillers, under which each party is granted an option to enforce the transaction supplemented with terms most favorable (within reason) to the other party. A deliberately incomplete contract with pro-defendant gap fillers transforms into two complete contracts, each favorable to a different party, with each party entitled to enforce only the contract favorable to her opponent. Under this approach, partial consent gives rise to a correspondingly intermediate burden of liability. The Article demonstrates that this regime promotes the interests of negotiating parties who enter agreements-to-agree. It also identifies various doctrinal practices that already incorporate the pro-defendant <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> logic. ...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia, and several other countries worldwide. As a result of mining operations, very large underground openings are created that are later backfilled to provide regional stability. The large underground voids that are backfilled are called stopes, and they can be approximated as rectangular prisms, which can be more than 100 m in depth. Backfilling is also seen as an effective means of disposing the by-products of the mineral processing called tailings that are left after the valuable minerals are extracted from the ore. There are several types of mine fills such as hydraulic <b>fills,</b> <b>cemented</b> hydraulic <b>fills,</b> paste <b>fills,</b> aggregate <b>fills,</b> <b>cemented</b> aggregate <b>fills,</b> and rock fills that are based on combinations of surface process tailings, and development waste or quarried rock.

40|$|Although recent {{developments}} in DNA sequencing have allowed for great leaps in both {{the quality and quantity}} of genome assembly projects, de novo assemblies still lack the efficiency and accuracy required for studying genetic variation of individuals. Thus, efficient and accurate methods for calling and genotyping genetic variants are fundamental to studying the genomes of individuals. We study the problem of genotyping insertion variants. We assume that the location of the insertion is given, and the task is to find the insertion sequence. Insertions are the hardest structural variant to genotype, because the insertion sequence must be assembled from the reads, whereas genotyping other structural variants only requires transformations of the reference genome. The current methods for constructing insertion variants are mostly linked to variation calling methods and are only able to construct small insertions. A sub-problem in genome assembly, the <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> problem, provides techniques that are readily applicable to insertion genotyping. <b>Gap</b> <b>filling</b> takes the context and length of a missing sequence in a genome assembly and attempts to assemble the intervening sequence. In this paper we show how tools and methods for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> can be used to assemble insertion variants by modeling the problem of insertion genotyping as <b>filling</b> <b>gaps</b> in the reference genome. We further give a general read filtering scheme to make the method scalable to large data sets. Our results show that <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> methods are competitive against insertion genotyping tools.

The resulting spectral <b>gaps</b> are <b>filled</b> in the decoder through techniques like Intelligent <b>Gap</b> <b>Filling</b> (IGF). IGF is currently being standardized in MPEG-H 3 D-Audio and also in 3 GPP Enhanced Voice Service (EVS). In IGF processing, spectral tiles are copied from a spectral source location into a target location and subsequently adapted by parameter steered post-processing to best match relevant properties of the original signal. Important properties include the spectral and temporal envelope.
