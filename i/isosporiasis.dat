50|$|Avoiding food {{or water}} that may be {{contaminated}} with stool can help prevent the infection of Cystoisospora (<b>Isosporiasis).</b> Good hand-washing, and personal-hygiene practices should be used as well.

50|$|<b>Isosporiasis,</b> {{also known}} as cystoisosporiasis, is a human {{intestinal}} disease caused by the parasite Isospora belli (now known as Cystoisospora belli). It is found worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas.

The first documented case was in 1915. It is usually spread indirectly, normally through contaminated food or water (CDC.gov).|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Romark {{launched}} {{a series of}} controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful {{in the treatment of}} cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to metronidazole. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of cyclosporiasis, <b>isosporiasis,</b> and amebiasis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cross-sectional}} study was undertaken {{to determine the}} prevalence of <b>isosporiasis</b> and its clinical and laboratory pattern in Venezuelan patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n 397). At enroll-ment, they underwent a thorough clinical history and physical examination, and provided stool specimens for the identification of Isospora belli and other parasites. Isospora belli was identified in 56 subjects (14 %) and diarrhea, either acute or chronic, was present in 98 % of these cases (P < 0. 001). Eosinophilia was strongly associated with <b>isosporiasis</b> (P 0. 01). It was {{also found that the}} presence of eosinophilia was more common in I. belli-infected patients without weight loss (P < 0. 001). Twenty-six (81. 25 %) subjects with I. belli infection had CD 4 + cell counts < 200 cells/mm 3 (P 0. 03). In addition, the data and its description shows the association to be < 100 cells/mm 3. This infection seems to be seasonal because the recovery of oocysts occurred mainly in months with significant rainfall. In fact, <b>isosporiasis</b> should be suspected in HIV-infected patients from tropical countries with diarrhea, weight loss, eosinophilia, and low CD 4 + cell counts...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} severe case of {{diarrhea}} in a 62 -year-old female HIV-negative patient from whom Giardia lamblia and Isospora belli were isolated. Because unusual and opportunistic infections {{should be considered}} as criteria for further analysis of immunological status, laboratory investigations led to a diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). This is the first reported case of <b>isosporiasis</b> in a patient with CVID and illustrates the importance of being aware of a possible link, particularly in relation to primary immunodeficiency...|$|E
40|$|Isospora belli {{infection}} is frequent {{in patients with}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in tropical areas. It has also been reported in other immunodepressive diseases, such as lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease. To date, no case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma-related <b>isosporiasis</b> {{has been reported in}} a non-HIV-infected patient. We describe a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with chronic diarrhea due to I. belli. In Europe, I. belli can cause severe chronic diarrhea in patients with malignancies whose country of origin is in an endemic area. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole can provide rapid and prolonged clinical and parasitologic cure...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found a high {{prevalence}} of Isospora belli and Cryptosporidium parvum infections in African acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with chronic diarrhoea. We aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasite in AIDS patients in hospital, not only those with diarrhoea, and to compare them with the general community. Clinically diagnosed aids patients in a Zambian teaching hospital were interviewed and examined, and stool specimens were studied for parasite infection. A control group was recruited from adults in a township near Lusaka. Of 90 AIDS patients (58 % male), 50 (56 %) had chronic diarrhoea and 9 (10 %) had diarrhoea of shorter duration. In the control group (105 adults; 85 % female), only one complained of diarrhoea. A variety of intestinal protozoa and helminths was found in 57 % of aids patients and 88 % of the community members. <b>Isosporiasis</b> was detected in 7, and cryptosporidiosis in 2, AIDS patients, all with diarrhoea, but not in any control. Strongyloides was found in 2 aids patients with diarrhoea and one community resident. Hospital patients with aids had fewer Entamoeba coli and E. histolytica infections, probably because of previous chemotherapy. We conclude that aids predisposes to <b>isosporiasis</b> and cryptosporidiosis, but not to infection with extracellular intestinal parasites, such as Entamoeba species, Blastocystis, Chilomastix, Endolimax, Ascaris and Necator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} 60 -year-old immunocompetent patient with chronic biliary <b>isosporiasis</b> {{who failed to}} re-spond to orally {{administered}} cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and orally administered treatment with nitazoxanide, a 5 -nitrothiazole benzamide compound. Severe malabsorption was regarded as responsible for the subtherapeutic levels of nitazoxanide in plasma and bile, resulting in treatment failure. Intravenously administered cotrimoxazole stopped the shedding of Isospora belli oocysts in bile within 5 days, excluding initially suspected resistance to cotrimoxazole. Patients with malabsorption and cholangitis due to Coccidia such as Isospora belli and Cryptosporidium spp. or due to protozoa that cause microsporidiasis seem to be predisposed to fail to respond to otherwise effective treatment...|$|E
40|$|HIV-infected {{patients}} from moderate regions who travel in tropical countries may experience clinical disease progression due to exposure to bacteria (including mycobacteria), fungi and parasites. In the Swiss HIV Cohort Study {{we examined the}} hypothesis that travelling {{increases the risk of}} tuberculosis, wasting syndrome, cryptosporidiosis, <b>isosporiasis,</b> cryptococcosis, coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis and Salmonella septicaemia. A total of 4549 participants were included (in 1988 - 1998) of whom 596 (13 · 1 %) travelled at least once. During 16 800 person-years of follow-up 231 patients developed at least 1 of the diseases of interest. Wasting syndrome was the only diagnosis significantly associated with travelling (hazard ratio 2 · 16, 95 % confidence interval 1 · 09 to 4 · 30). The risk of wasting syndrome (‘slim disease') should be taken into account when counselling HIV-infected patients intending to travel in tropical region...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) prophylaxis reported for persons living with HIV in Cote d'Ivoire {{are difficult to}} extrapolate to sub-Saharan African countries where bacterial resistance to TS is higher and cross-resistance between TS and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) may impair SP efficacy for malaria treatment. We conducted a community-based cohort study to measure the incidence of potentially TS-preventable illnesses in Blantyre, Malawi. We found {{a high incidence of}} malaria, invasive bacterial infections, and probable bacterial pneumonias but low rates of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, <b>isosporiasis,</b> and Toxoplasma encephalitis. Most bacterial isolates were resistant to TS but sensitive to azithromycin, a possible alternative to TS. Clinical trials are needed to determine the role of TS or alternative regimens for prophylaxis against secondary infections among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. These should also assess benefit in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy...|$|E
40|$|Isospora belli causes {{diarrhoea}} {{in patients}} with AIDS. Most respond to targeted therapy and recommendations are that secondary prophylaxis can be stopped following immune reconstitution with ART. We report eight cases of chronic <b>isosporiasis</b> that persisted despite standard antimicrobial therapy, secondary prophylaxis, and good immunological and virological response to ART. Median CD 4 nadir was 175. 5 cells/mm 3 and median highest CD 4 while symptomatic was 373 cells/mm 3. Overall 34 % of stool samples and 63 % of duodenal biopsy specimens were positive for oocytes. Four patients died, two remain symptomatic and two recovered. Possible explanations for persistence of symptoms include host factors such as antigen specific immune deficiency or generalised reduction in gut immunity. Parasite factors may include accumulating resistance to co-trimoxazole. Research is required to determine the optimum dose and duration of co-trimoxazole therapy and whether dual therapy may be necessary. Mortality was high and pending more data we recommend extended treatment with high-dose co-trimoxazole in similar cases...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{intestinal}} protozoa {{are responsible}} for clinically important infections in both the developed and the developing world. These organisms {{are responsible for}} both acute and chronic diarrhea, and Entamoeba histolytica, which affects the colon, can spread to involve the liver. Many of these pathogens, particularly the intracellular protozoa that predominantly affect the small intestine, produce their most devastating effects in patients with HIV/AIDS {{and other forms of}} immune deficiency. There are also various intestinal protozoa that do not seem to have any adverse effects on humans and can, therefore, be regarded as harmless commensal organisms. Although treatment has been available for several decades for giardiasis, <b>isosporiasis</b> and amoebiasis, until recently there have been no effective remedies for infection with intestinal coccidia—Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium and Cyclospora species. Cyclospora respond well to co-trimoxazole, microsporidia respond variably to albendazole, and cryptosporidia can often be eradicated by nitazoxanide. In chronically infected HIV-positive patients, treatment with multidrug regimens usually results in rapid resolution of the diarrhea and, in many instances, eradication of the parasite...|$|E

The history showed that the faeces was greenish-mucoid for 3 days before it was presented to KVUMK. On 3 rd October 2014, “Mok Tam” was inappetant, dull and depressed. The owner noticed that Mok Tam was having watery diarrhea with brown yellowish faeces. After 4 days later, Mok Tam was still inappetant and there was presence of pasty greenish diarrhoea and vomiting. The cat was presented to KVUMK on 10 th October, 2014. Upon physical examination, Mok Tam was dull and mentally depressed. The body weight was 1. 3 kg and temperature was 37 oC (hypothermia), the heart rate was 108 bpm which is lower than normal range indicative of bradycardia, and respiratory rate was normal. The Capillary refill time (CRT) and dehydration status was normal but the mucous membrane was pale.

40|$|Coccidial parasites of {{the genus}} Isospora cause {{intestinal}} disease in several mammalian host species. These protozoal parasites have asexual and sexual stages within intestinal cells of their hosts and produce an environmentally resistant cyst stage, the oocyst. Infections are acquired by the ingestion of infective (sporulated) oocysts in contaminated food or water. Some species of mammalian Isospora have evolved {{the ability to use}} paratenic (transport) hosts. In these cases, infections can be acquired by ingestion of an infected paratenic host. Human intestinal <b>isosporiasis</b> is caused by Isospora belli. Symptoms of I. belli infection in immunocompetent patients include diarrhea, steatorrhea, headache, fever, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss, blood is not usually present in the feces. The disease is often chronic, with parasites present in the feces or biopsy specimens for several months to years. Recurrences are common, Symptoms are more severe in AIDS patients, with the diarrhea being more watery. Extraintestinal stages of I. belli have been observed in AIDS patients but not immunocompetent patients. Treatment of I. belli infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole usually results in a rapid clinical response. Maintenance treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is needed because relapses often occur once treatment is stopped...|$|E
40|$|Isospora (Cystoisospora) belli {{diarrhea}} {{can sometimes}} be fulminant in immunocompromised patients.

We describe <b>isosporiasis</b> in an HIV-negative Sudanese-American female who presented with a debilitating diarrheal illness and profound weight loss. Isospora belli was detected in her stool by modified acid-fast staining. Serologic testing was negative for HIV but positive for HTLV- 1 infection. Treatment with TMP-SMZ led to improvement in her diarrhea which recurred after stopping antibiotics. Subsequently, she developed generalized lymphadenopathy which was diagnosed as ATLL on immunohistochemical staining. Chemotherapy was initiated, but her condition continued to worsen due to persistent diarrhea and resulting profound electrolyte abnormalities. The patient opted for comfort measures and died a few weeks later at a nursing facility. This case emphasizes that the detection of I. belli should trigger testing for HIV, HTLV- 1, and other causes of immunocompromise.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{describe}} the epidemiology of intestinal parasites in patients from an AIDS reference service in Northeastern São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation {{was done for}} all HIV- 1 /AIDS-positive patients whose Hospital de Base/São José do Rio Preto laboratorial analysis was positive for enteroparasites after diagnosis of HIV- 1 infection, from January 1998 to December 2008. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical software version 2. 4. 1. The level of significance adopted was 5 %. RESULTS: The most frequent protozoan was Isospora belli (4. 2 %), followed by Giardia lamblia (3. 5 %), Entamoeba coli (2. 8 %), and Cryptosporidium parvum (0. 3 %). Ancylostoma duodenale (1. 4 %) was the most frequently detected helminth, while Taenia saginata and Strongiloides stercoralis were found in 0. 7 % of the samples. The results showed that diarrhea {{was significantly associated with}} giardiasis and <b>isosporiasis.</b> However, no association was observed between CD 4 + cell counts, viral load, and the characteristics of any particular parasite. CONCLUSIONS: Our data may be useful for further comparisons with other Brazilian regions and other developing countries. The data may also provide important clues toward improving the understanding, prevention, and control of enteric parasites around the world...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} intestinal parasitic infections and to investigate the possible associations of clinical status and laboratory findings with the different parasites found in stool samples. Methods: Each patient was provided with one standard fecal collection vial containing 10 % formalin for detecting ova, larvae, and cysts. To detect Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the acid-fast Kinyoun stain and fluorescent auramine-rhodamine stain were used. Results: A total of 200 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome participated in this study; 40 % were infected {{with at least one}} pathogenic species. The total prevalence of parasites was 16 % for Giardia lamblia, 13 % for Entamoeba coli, 7 % for Cryptosporidium parvum, 3. 5 % for Endolimax nana, 2. 5 % for Ascaris lumbricoides, 2. 5 % for Strongyloides stercoralis, 2 % for Isospora belli, and 0. 5 % for Blastocystis hominis. Results showed that diarrhea was significantly associated with cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and <b>isosporiasis.</b> However, no association was observed between the CD 4 + cell counts and the manifestation of any particular parasite. Conclusions: The data support the value of standard fecal examinations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, {{even in the absence of}} diarrhea, since these examinations easily can be performed, with low costs, and frequently disclose treatable conditions...|$|E
40|$|Cholecystitis {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{surgical}} indications affecting human beings in many countries. A variety of infectious agents can be associated with acute or chronic acalculous cholecystitis, especially in HIV/AIDS patients. In this investigation, the authors aim to describe two cases of histologically and molecularly documented cystoisosporiasis (syn. <b>isosporiasis)</b> as the cause of chronic acalculous cholecystitis in two immunodeficient patients. During microscopic examinations of more than 2500 diarrheic patients’ samples, 11 cases of cystoisosporiasis-related recurrent persistent/chronic diarrhea were detected. A review of the medical records of Cystoisospora belli (syn. Isospora belli) -positive patients showed that two of them, i. e. a patient with prolonged corticosteroid therapy and an AIDS patient, several months prior to fecal examinations had undergone cholecystectomy due to acalculous cholecystitis. The study was continued by a review of the histopathological investigation of the recuts prepared from the excised gallbladder tissue sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin in order to detect a possible specific clinical correlation with cystoisosporiasis. Light microscopic examination revealed the presence of various developmental stages of a coccidial parasite, namely Cystoisospora belli, in both patients’ gallbladder tissue sections. To the best of our knowledge, C. bellii -associated cholecystitis has not been previously reported in a patient with prolonged corticosteroid therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cryptosporidium and Isospora {{are known}} as one of the main cause of {{diarrhea}} in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects, all over the world. Incidence of enteropathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. and Isospora belli considerably has increased, since immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rapidly disseminated. In addition, cancer patients are highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and <b>isosporiasis</b> in immunocompromised patients in Tehran. Methods: This study carried out on patients admitted to Imam Khomeini hospital during 2013 - 2014. Stool samples collected from 350 immunocompromised patients. Formol-ether concentration was performed for all stool samples. Zeil-Neelsen technique was applied to stain the prepared smears and finally, all slides were examined by light microscope. Results: Out of 350 patients, 195 (55. 7 %) and 155 (44. 3 %) were male and female, respectively. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 3 (0. 9 %) samples including one sample from HIV+/AIDS patients and 2 samples from organ transplant recipients. Isospora oocysts were detected in 4 (1. 1 %) samples consisting 2 HIV+/AIDS patients, one patients suffering from malignancy and one patients with other immunodeficiency diseases. Conclusion: Cryptosporidium sp, and I. belli are the most prevalent gastrointestinal parasitic protozoans that infect a broad range of individuals, particularly those patients who have a suppressed or deficient immunity system. </p...|$|E

40|$|To {{measure the}} effect of the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) epidemic on mortality from opportunistic infections (OIs) in 1993, national multiple-cause death certificate data were examined using two approaches. First, for each OI, the percentage of deaths with HIV infection reported as the underlying cause was calculated. Second, the age-adjusted rate of death per million population was compared with the rate predicted from a model of rates in 1970 – 1980 or 1979 – 1981, as available. The percentage of deaths with HIV as the underlying cause and the ratio of observed to predicted death rates were as follows: toxoplasmosis, 91 % and 86 (5. 24 / 0. 06); cryptosporidiosis/ <b>isosporiasis,</b> 90 % and infinite (1. 61 / 0. 00); progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, 87 % and 19 (2. 58 / 0. 13); pneumocystosis, 82 % and 18 (15. 44 / 0. 87); cytomegalovirus disease, 82 % and 17 (12. 60 / 0. 74); nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, 79 % and 18 (15. 51 / 0. 84); cryptococcosis, 76 % and 4 (5. 80 / 1. 35); and histoplasmosis, 68 % and 6 (1. 36 / 0. 23). Thus, the HIV epidemic has greatly increased mortality from several OIs. through 1978 [5], and ICD- 9 codes were used for deaths fromMortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec- 1979 through 1993 [6].

40|$|The {{medical records}} of {{patients}} with AIDS admitted to a general hospital in Brazil from 1989 to 1997 were reviewed retrospectively with the aim at defining the frequency and etiology of fever of undetermined origin (FUO) in HIV-infected patients of a tropical country and to evaluate {{the usefulness of the}} main diagnostic procedures. 188 (58. 4 %) out of 322 patients reported fever at admission to hospital and 55 (17. 1 %) had FUO. Those with FUO had a mean CD 4 + cell count of 98 /ml. A cause of fever was identified for 45 patients (81. 8 %). Tuberculosis (32. 7 %), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (10. 9 %), and Mycobacterium avium complex (9. 1 %) were the most frequent diagnoses. Other infectious diseases are also of note, such as cryptococcal meningitis (5. 5 %), sinusitis (3. 6 %), Salmonella-S. mansoni association (3. 6 %), disseminated histoplasmosis (3. 6 %), neurosyphilis (1. 8 %), and <b>isosporiasis</b> (1. 8 %). Four patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7. 3 %). We conclude that an initial aggressive diagnostic approach should be always considered because biopsies (lymph node, liver and bone marrow) produced the highest yield in the diagnosis of FUO and the majority of the diagnosed diseases are treatable. The association of diseases is common and have contributed to delay the final diagnosis of FUO in most cases.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Isospora belli and its correlation with CD 4 + cell counts in HIV-positive patients with diarrhea in this region. Materials and Methods: Stool samples from 250 HIV-positive patients, including 200 with diarrhea and 50 without diarrhea {{included in the study}} were examined for the presence of enteric parasites under microscopy. Prevalence of the enteric parasites with special reference to I. belli in HIV-positive patients with and without diarrhea were calculated and correlated with their CD 4 + cell counts. Results: Enteric parasites were detected in 39 % of the HIV patients with diarrhea compared to 30 % without diarrhea. I. belli was detected in 22 % of the patients with diarrhea and in 4 % without diarrhea (P = 0. 0019). I. belli was the most common parasite, followed by Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (8 %) and Cryptosporidium parvum (5 %) in HIV-positive patients with diarrhea. In HIV-positive patients without diarrhea, the most common parasite detected was E. histolytica/dispar (12 %) followed by C. parvum (6 %) and I. belli (4 %). The mean CD 4 cell count of HIV-positive patients with diarrhea suffering from <b>isosporiasis</b> was 138. 35 ± 70. 71. In patients with CD 4 cell counts < 200 /μl, I. belli was seen in 36 / 123 stool samples and 2 / 27 stool samples which was statistically significant (P = 0. 0157). Conclusion: I. belli was the predominant parasite with a prevalence of 22 % among HIV-positive patients with diarrhea, majority having CD 4 cell count < 200 /μl. This study highlights the importance of routine screening for coccidian parasites in HIV-positive patients with and without diarrhea especially in those with low CD 4 cell counts...|$|E
