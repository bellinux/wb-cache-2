Supported by Tee-Tot, and bolstered by new rhythm guitarist A.J. [...] "King Taco Pearl" [...] Nesselrod, Throw Rag started building a wider fan base with their intense, maniacal live shows. Usually wearing a sea captain's hat and 70s double-knit suit, Sean Doe and Jacko (with {{nothing more than a}} wife beater and <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> pants) became notorious for stripping on stage. The band eventually started opening for acts such as Supersuckers, Green Day, Wesley Willis and Willie Nelson. In 2001, the band released a CD split with Supersuckers which featured a song that would later appear a Warped Tour 2002 Tour Compilation and their follow up album Desert Shores. Tee-Tot was only released in smaller record stores, and was available at live shows. Now out of print, Acetate plans to re-release the album in 2008.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what effects wash water temperatures and drying methods have on the dimensional stability and surface appearance of filament polyester <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> fabrics. Changes in general physical properties, dimensional change, and surface appearance of four fabrics were studied after ten launderings at three wash water temperatures with two drying methods.

All filament polyester <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> fabrics in this study shrank more when washed in hot water and when dried in the tumble dryer than when washed in warm or cool water and horizontally screen dried. Shrinkage was continuous after five and ten launderings, although at a decreasing rate. All four fabrics had better appearance when laundered in warm or cool wash water and when tumble dried after ten launderings than when washed in hot water and horizontally screen dried.

A review of literature indicates a trend toward polypropylene blend fabrics for wearing apparel, specifically for knits. The purpose of the research was to compare two experimental <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> fabrics, a 50 percent Creslan/Herculon blend and a 50 percent rayon/Herculon blend. The <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> blends, constructed of a French pique stitch, were developed into pre-school boys' golf-style shirts. Fabric serviceability was tested through ten weeks of actual wear by seven nursery school boys, and in the textile laboratory for abrasion resistance, wrinkle recovery and for actual thickness. Consumer acceptance was subjectively evaluated by {{the parents of the}} boys, a panel of Oregon State University Clothing and Textiles faculty members, the nursery school supervisor, and the writer. The results of this study indicated that consumers will accept and purchase polypropylene blend shirts on the assumptions that the fabric will 1) provide superior serviceability, 2) resist stains and wrinkles, 3) return to original appearance with limited care, 4) be obtainable {{in a wide range of}} bright colors, and 5) be within a competitive price range to shirts of comparable style and fabric. Laboratory tests correlated with natural wear testing indicating both knit blends will pill, will not absorb moisture, will be colorfast, and will increase in thickness when exposed to a fluff drying cycle.

40|$|Reweaving and reknitting {{techniques}} rebuild {{losses in}} textiles by replacing damaged yams to duplicate original structures and patterns. Traditionally viewed as restorative methods used mainly for consumer clothing and household furnishings, reweaving and reknitting have much potential for {{adaptation to the}} repair and stabilization of historic and collectible textiles. Standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques utilize handsewn underlay and overlay patches and adhesive-coated underlay supports. Although these techniques can provide practical and time-saving approaches {{for a wide variety}} of situations, problems with these techniques can sometimes develop over the long term when issues of structural integrity and appearance are concerned. While reweaving and reknitting techniques can provide superior aesthetic and structural results, they require more time and are more costly. This study evaluated the possibility of expanding the use of reweaving and reknitting techniques in the repair and stabilization of damaged textiles to meet textile conservation challenges. The research involved a panel review of actual textiles that had received various stabilizing treatments and a statistical analysis of the evaluation data. This report includes detailed instructions outlining basic reweaving and reknitting techniques and a discussion of applying these and traditional treatments to woven and knit fabrics. Three different reweaving or reknitting techniques, applying an underlay with hand stitching, and attaching an adhesive-coated backing were used to repair damaged fabrics. The textiles treated represented a range of woven and knitted structures including a plain weave I low thread count, plain weave I high thread count, twill weave, patterned weave, stockinet knit, <b>double</b> <b>knit,</b> and patterned knit. Each of the three treatments was applied to each of the seven fabrics. The 21 fabric I treatment combinations were examined by a panel of reviewers and evaluated with respect to specific qualities of visual appearance, structural integrity, and effect of repair on drape. They recorded their rating on a Visual Analogue Scale. The evaluators (n = 49) of the treated fabrics gave the reweaving and reknitting treatments statistically significantly higher ratings in all of the three qualities reviewed compared with the treatment samples repaired with standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques. These repairs took the longest time to complete with average completion times ranging from 2. 63 to 17. 50 hours per sample. The treatment samples repaired with the textile conservation techniques of applying an underlay with hand stitching and an adhesive-coated backing received the lowest ratings in all of the three qualities with no statistically significant difference between the means of these two conservation techniques. Both textile conservation techniques took the least time to complete with average completion times ranging from 0. 88 to 2. 00 hours. The high ratings that the reweaving and reknitting treatment samples received in this research suggest the need for curators and conservators to be aware of the benefits of reweaving and reknitting and consider using these techniques to repair objects that merit the time and expenditure required. This research confirmed the lack of current, thorough information on reweaving and reknitting techniques and negligible commentary in the textile conservation literature to explain the application of these methods; this seems to indicate their minimal use or consideration in the field...|$|E
25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame.
