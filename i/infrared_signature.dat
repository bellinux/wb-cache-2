5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|Danish AW101s have {{a higher}} gross weight {{capacity}} of 15,600kg and were, as delivered, coated in a paint designed to reduce the aircraft's <b>infrared</b> <b>signature.</b> In the SAR role, RDAF AW101s have a crew of six and were initially painted yellow to distinguish themselves from AW101 allocated to military duties, but were later painted green, and all 14 AW101s are used for SAR and troop transport.|$|E
5|$|The class {{incorporates}} {{some major}} features including {{but not limited}} to the 'X'-shaped hull form to improve stealth, a raft-mounted propulsion system to reduce vibration, and an <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> suppression system. It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that enables them to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the indigenization achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E

50|$|Inclusion of low {{observable}} {{technologies for}} reconnaissance operations are also supported, such as minimization of <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures,</b> acoustic signatures and seismic signatures. A Halon fire detection and suppression {{system can be}} used for the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{clothing}} {{will decrease}} visible and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> and {{will include a}} light-weight ballistic protection vest, a mask and suit protective against weapons of mass destruction, eye protection against lasers, laser illumination warner, reconnaissance radar and health status sensors.|$|R
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and <b>infrared</b> <b>signature,</b> effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small <b>infrared</b> <b>signature,</b> and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
25|$|The AMX {{is capable}} of {{operating}} at high subsonic speed and low altitude, by day or night, and if necessary, from bases with poorly equipped or damaged runways. It possesses a low <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> and a reduced radar cross-section to help prevent detection, while low vulnerability of structure and systems aid survivability and a complement of integrated electronic countermeasures (ECM), air-to-air missiles and nose-mounted guns provide self-defence capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The ship {{features}} a [...] "low point" [...] design and combines this with radar absorbing paint to reduce radar signature.In {{a departure from}} existing designs, there is no funnel stack. Instead, the diesels exhaust near the waterline to minimise <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} airpower and the ever-increasing component of stealth technology in dictating warfare, based on the need felt in the literature to integrate {{and place them in}} the right perspective. Hence, the role of stealth aircraft and the dominance of all aspects of stealth technology, especially in recent conflicts, are reviewed. The integration of the fundamental aspects of stealth technology, through its classification, types of aircraft signatures: especially radar, <b>infrared,</b> and visual <b>signatures,</b> their sources of origin, modelling techniques, and methods of signature reduction are discussed. Due to the increasing importance of <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> relative to radar <b>signatures,</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> are also closely examined and analysed. Hence, the lock-on and surveillance ranges of infrared detectors are compared. Future projections in stealth technology, especially based on the role of anti-stealth technologies, are also elaborated...|$|R
50|$|The F-16 Low-Observable Asymmetric Nozzle (LOAN) {{demonstrator}} was an F-16C {{fitted in}} late 1996 with a prototype nozzle with significantly reduced radar and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> and lowered maintenance requirements.

25|$|In May 2009, Spitzer {{researchers}} from Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate {{appears to have}} been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> of forsterite silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by Spitzer in April 2008. These crystals were not present in Spitzer previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{issued a}} {{certificate}} of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and M/RQ-9 aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests {{had been made in}} 2005 for the aircraft to be used in search and rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina, but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's infrared camera with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> of a human body from an altitude of 3km (10,000ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.|$|E
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
50|$|Some {{motion sensors}} will be {{triggered}} by pets moving around a home. This problem can be fixed by finding motion detectors that are not sensitive to <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> belonging to anything less than eighty pounds, or by restricting the access of pets to rooms with motion detectors.|$|R
50|$|The POVZEE vessels feature stealth {{technology}} with reduced radar and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> {{as well as}} special design to minimize the propulsion system's noise emissions and vibrations. An aft hangar and flight deck enables operation of a single rotary-wing aircraft. The ship carries two small semi-rigid boats RHIB for rescue and transport purposes.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{analysis}} the aircraft should be capable of a sustained maneuvering speed of Mach 0.9 {{at an altitude of}} 6000 m; quick acceleration from Mach 0.9 to 1.5 at 9000 m, high deceleration, independent of the relative speed; reasonable combat autonomy with integral fuel tanks; and minimal radar and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> (Stealth).|$|R
25|$|The AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System (MWS) {{is used on}} {{slow moving}} {{aircraft}} such as helicopters and military transport aircraft to notify the pilot of threats and to trigger the aircraft's countermeasures systems. Its main users are the U.S Army, Navy and Air Force, but is also operated by other countries. Originally developed by Loral Space & Communications, it has been solely a product of ATK since 2002. The AN/AAR-47 passively detects missiles by their <b>infrared</b> <b>signature,</b> and uses algorithms to differentiate between incoming missiles and false alarms. Newer versions also have laser warning sensors and are capable of detecting {{a wider range of}} threats. After processing the nature of the threat, the system gives the pilot an audio and visual warning, and tells the direction of the incoming threat. It also sends a signal to the aircraft's infrared countermeasures system, which can then for example deploy flares. The development of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the primary contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2, which added laser warning functionality.|$|E

2500|$|In current designs {{massive amounts}} of heat are created by the {{electricity}} flowing through the rails, {{as well as by}} the friction of the projectile leaving the device.

50|$|During its mission, IRAS (and {{later the}} Spitzer Space Telescope) {{detected}} odd <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> around several stars. This {{led to the}} systems being targeted by the Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS instrument between 1999 and 2006, but nothing was detected. In 2014, using new image processing techniques on the Hubble data, researchers discovered planetary disks around these stars.|$|R
50|$|Abhyas's radar {{cross-section}} (RCS) {{as well as}} its visual and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> can be augmented to simulate a variety of aircraft for air-defense weapon practices.

2500|$|In 2010, fullerenes (C60) {{have been}} {{discovered}} {{in a cloud of}} cosmic dust surrounding a distant star 6500 light years away.

2500|$|The South African Valour-class frigates are {{the major}} surface ships of the South African Navy.

They were designed and built using principles of stealthy design, including the extensive use of [...] "X-form" [...] structure design in which right angles and vertical surfaces are avoided, and techniques to reduce the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature,</b> such as expelling pre-cooled exhaust gasses just above the waterline. Blohm + Voss, the designers, claim that this class has the radar signature of a vessel one-half her size, 75% less infrared emissions than previous designs, {{as well as a}} 20% lower life-cycle cost, 25% lower displacement, and 30% fewer crewmen.|$|E
2500|$|The General Electric Company {{provides}} an Automatic Target Recognition Unit (ATRU) for the SLAM-ER that processes prelaunch and postlaunch targeting data, allows high speed video comparison (DSMAC), and enables the SLAM-ER {{to be used}} in a true [...] "fire and forget" [...] manner. It also includes a [...] "man-in-the-loop" [...] mode, where the pilot or weapons system officer can designate the point of impact precisely, even if the target has no distinguishing <b>infrared</b> <b>signature.</b> It can be launched and controlled by a variety of aircraft including the F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18 Super Hornet, and P-3C Orion, {{as well as by the}} U.S. Air Force's F-15E Strike Eagle. Before the retirement of the S-3B Viking, it was also able to launch and control the SLAM-ER. The South Korean air force's version of the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-15K Slam Eagle, has been capable of launching and controlling the SLAM-ER since 2006 in test exercises.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{study of the}} HALESIS (High-Altitude Luminous Events Studied by Infrared Spectro-imagery) project is presented. The purpose of this experiment is to measure the atmospheric perturbation in the minutes following the occurrence of transient luminous events (TLEs) from a stratospheric balloon in the altitude range of 20 - 40 km. The instrumentation will include a spectro-imager embedded in a pointing gondola. <b>Infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> of a single blue jet were simulated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and were then compared with a panel of commercially available instrument specifications. The sensitivity of the signatures with a local perturbation of the main vibrational energy level populations of CO 2, CO, NO, O 3, and H 2 O was measured and the <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> of a single blue jet taking into account non-LTE hypotheses were {{compared with the same}} panel of commercially available instrument specifications.

50|$|Infrared stealth {{is an area}} of stealth {{technology}} aimed at reducing <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures.</b> This reduces a platform's susceptibility to infrared guided weapons and infrared surveillance sensors, and thus increases the platform's overall survivability. Infrared stealth is particularly applicable to military jets because of the detectable engines and plumes from non-stealth aircraft, but it also applies to military helicopters, warships, land vehicles and dismounted soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The Rafale is {{fitted with}} two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of {{providing}} up to 50 kN (11,250 lbf) of dry thrust and 75 kN (16,900 lbf) with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures.</b> The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.|$|R
2500|$|This {{class of}} warship is {{conspicuous}} {{for a lack}} of any funnels. To add to their stealth characteristics, the exhaust fumes from the Meko A200's gas turbines and diesel engines are cooled by spraying water into the exhaust duct and then expelled just above the ship's waterline, making the frigate almost invisible to most infrared detectors. In 2004, the project officer Rear Admiral (J.G.) Johnny Kamerman explained that the ships’ design features incorporated stealth characteristics that gave the Valour-class very low radar, acoustic, and magnetic signatures. [...] "It is the first major warship in the world with a horizontal exhaust and water jet propulsion, and has an X-form outer hull," [...] he said. Its manufacturers added that the design has the radar cross-section of a missile patrol boat, a 75% lower <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> than previous designs, as well as a 20% lower life-cycle cost, 25% less displacement and 30% fewer crewmen. The lack of funnels also frees up desirable room amidships for armaments, crew quarters, and store rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the fourth}} test was {{described}} as a success, the New York Times in August 1993 reported that the HOE4 test was rigged to increase the likelihood of a successful hit. [...] At the urging of Senator David Pryor, the General Accounting Office investigated the claims and concluded that though steps were taken {{to make it easier for}} the interceptor to find its target (including some of those alleged by the New York Times), the available data indicated that the interceptor had been successfully guided by its onboard infrared sensors in the collision, and not by an onboard radar guidance system as alleged. [...] Per the GAO report, the net effect of the DOD enhancements increased the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> of the target vessel by 110% over the realistic missile signature initially proposed for the HOE program, but nonetheless the GAO concluded the enhancements to the target vessel were reasonable given the objectives of the program and the geopolitical consequences of its failure. Further, the report concluded that the DOD's subsequent statements before Congress about the HOE program [...] "fairly characterize" [...] the success of HOE4, but confirmed that the DOD never disclosed to Congress the enhancements made to the target vessel.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> is used {{by defense}} {{scientists}} and the military to describe the appearance of objects to infrared sensors. An <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> depends on many factors, including the shape {{and size of the}} object, temperature and emissivity, reflection of external sources (earthshine, sunshine, skyshine) from the objects surface, the background against which it is viewed and the waveband of the detecting sensor. As such there is no all-encompassing definition of <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> nor any trivial means of measuring it. For example, the <b>infrared</b> <b>signature</b> of a truck viewed against a field will vary significantly with changing weather, time of day and engine loading.|$|E
50|$|JP-7 is a {{compound}} mixture composed primarily of hydrocarbons; including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes; with addition of fluorocarbons {{to increase its}} lubricant properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn more efficiently, and a cesium-containing compound known as A-50, which is to aid in disguising the radar and <b>infrared</b> <b>signatures</b> of the exhaust plume.
