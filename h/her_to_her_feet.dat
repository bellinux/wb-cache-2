2500|$|After Lucheni struck her, the empress collapsed. A coach driver helped <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and {{alerted the}} Austrian {{concierge}} of the Beau-Rivage, {{a man named}} Planner, who had been watching the empress's progress toward the Genève. The two women walked roughly [...] to the gangway and boarded, at which point Sztáray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth's arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Sztáray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat’s captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth's identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Sztáray opened her gown, cut Elisabeth's corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and Sztáray {{asked her if she}} was in pain, and she replied, [...] "No". She then asked, [...] "What has happened?" [...] and lost consciousness again.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, and then {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} lifted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|She started up, {{wringing}} her hands. It {{was something}} to have got <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Almayer dragged <b>her</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{and looked}} close {{into her face}} while she struggled, turning her head away from his wild stare.|$|R
60|$|He saw <b>her</b> stagger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{holding the}} baby at arm's length from her, her eyes glued in horror upon the little chubby face and {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Katharine rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{tone and}} {{expression}} were impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|He stops {{abruptly}} {{at sight}} of a strange lady. As for Amy, the word 'Alice' brings <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Chandler {{assisted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> with {{instant and}} solicitous courtesy. The girl hobbled {{to the wall}} of the building, leaned against it, and thanked him demurely.|$|E
60|$|Silverstein {{was helping}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She obeyed blindly, the daze {{of the dream}} still on her. His hand grasped her arm and he was turning her toward the door.|$|E
60|$|The man helped <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{struggle}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> veil or cloak {{had evidently}} fallen from her head, for the Cardinal and Lord Everingham, who were silently, {{and with no}} small measure of curiosity, watching the strange spectacle, caught the glint of a woman's face and of bright golden hair.|$|R
60|$|She rose unwillingly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> manner was sullen and unyielding.|$|R
60|$|Madeline sprang <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> {{face flushed}} {{and her eyes}} ablaze.|$|R
60|$|Larry gently raised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{but it was}} {{a minute}} or two before she could stand upright, and the man's face was haggard when he lifted her to the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was it?" [...] again demanded The Sheik, {{seizing the}} girl roughly {{by the hair}} and {{dragging}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> where he shook her venomously. [...] "What was it a picture of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At this moment, {{seized by}} some sudden weakness, Noie sank {{down upon the}} stones. Richard bent over her to lift <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> again, but she thrust him away, saying slowly and in gasps: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "I {{first thought}} of cutting {{a hole in}} the {{partition}} wall {{at the foot of the}} bed, for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> put <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> through." ...|$|R
60|$|She rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{expression}} {{was one of}} dogged but patient humility.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. You poor over-worked things. (Evidently AGATHA is his favourite, for {{he helps}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> put <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> on the settee, while CATHERINE has <b>to</b> dispose of <b>her</b> own <b>feet.)</b> Rest your weary limbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I, it is I," [...] I answered, lifting <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> for {{she seemed}} to weigh {{no more than a}} child. Her head fell upon my shoulder, and she too began to weep.|$|E
60|$|A sharp peal of the {{door-bell}} thrilled {{through the}} house, {{and as if}} {{the pull of the}} bell-wire had twitched <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> Mrs. Leighton sprang up and grappled with her daughter in their common terror.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{appeared}} reluctant, {{but made}} no resistance, and when finally I raised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> I {{found it was}} necessary to lean against a birch trunk to hide the fit of trembling that seized me.|$|E
60|$|Helen rose {{suddenly}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{eyes were}} fixed upon a figure approaching through the wood.|$|R
60|$|So {{the maid}} {{assisted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> gain <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> although Langwidere was the stronger of the two; {{and then the}} Princess slowly walked across the silver floor <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cabinet, leaning heavily at every step upon Nanda's arm.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes shone. The {{years had}} fallen away. She rose tremblingly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> arms stole around his neck.|$|R
60|$|She {{put her arm}} {{round her}} mother, to lift her from her chair, {{but the old man}} did not stir, and Mela called Mrs. Mandel from the next room. Between them they raised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{stepped over}} to Mrs. Green, and putting a strong {{arm around her}} raised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "And what's mine is mother's," [...] he concluded, and, helping her across the room, placed her in the best arm-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{anything}} were to happen--publicly--I should die, I should die!' {{the girl}} exclaimed passionately {{and with a}} motion that carried <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> This time she settled herself for departure. Lady Davenant's admonition rather frightened than sustained her.|$|E
60|$|When she arose, he, {{looking on}} the ground all the time, saw {{suddenly}} sprinkled on the black wet beech-roots many scarlet carnation petals, like splashed drops of blood; and red, small splashes fell from her bosom, streaming down <b>her</b> dress <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a silence. Then Ruth rose slowly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{tone was}} {{suddenly}} altered, her eyes pleaded with his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Merely as a fellow-countryman, Miss Leffingwell--" [...] he began, {{when she}} sprang <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> eyes dancing, and {{finished}} the sentence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not thus," [...] said he, a frown {{between his}} eyes. He {{took her by}} the elbows and gently but very firmly brought <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> again. [...] "It is not fitting you should kneel save at your prayers." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{woman said}} she would try, and he {{assisted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She was still very weak, and readily consented to lean on his arm; and thus they moved slowly back the way the captain of Company D had come.|$|E
60|$|ACIS. Here! Thats it. Now youre {{clean and}} decent. Up with you! Oopsh! [He hauls <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She cannot walk at first, but masters {{it after a}} few steps]. Now then: march. Here she is, Ancient: put her through the catechism.|$|E
2500|$|The Ilongot {{is buried}} in a sitting position, and if a woman, has <b>her</b> hands tied <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>her</b> [...] "ghost" [...] from roaming.|$|R
60|$|The executioner made {{shift to}} obey him when {{suddenly}} Madonna Paola leapt <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> cheeks flushed {{and her eyes}} bright with a new excitement.|$|R
60|$|Pauline rose {{suddenly}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> bosom was heaving, {{her face}} was like a white mask. Her hands were suddenly thrown high above her head.|$|R
