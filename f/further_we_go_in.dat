2500|$|There was {{controversy}} surrounding the judges' comments over the audition of a Special Olympics participant named Jonathan Jayne. American Idol producer Ken Warwick responded saying that [...] "It's not a conscious decision, It's {{just that the}} <b>further</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the series, there are less and less good singers, so the numbers are made up by more bad ones." [...] Warwick said that he thinks everyone {{has the right to}} audition, and added that in some instances when there are singers with certain disabilities who just want to meet the judges, the producers will [...] "turn the cameras off and bring them in. We give them a good experience." ...|$|E

[...] Poole considers Benedict [...] "a negligent Pope, very likely a profligate man", but notes that the picture presented of Benedict is drawn {{at a time when the}} party opposed to him was in the ascendant, and he had neither friends nor supporters.|$|E

6000|$|The <b>further</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> {{the history}} of {{literary}} forgeries, the more (as is natural) do we find them to be of a pious or priestly character. When the clergy alone can write, only the clergy can forge. In such ages people are interested chiefly in prophecies and warnings, or, if they are careful about literature, {{it is only when}} literature contains some kind of title-deeds. Thus Solon is said to have forged a line in the Homeric catalogue of the ships for the purpose of proving that Salamis belonged to Athens. But the great antique forger, the [...] "Ionian father of the rest," [...] is, doubtless, Onomacritus. There exists, to be sure, an Egyptian inscription professing to be of the fourth, but probably of the twenty-sixth, dynasty. The Germans hold the latter view; the French, from patriotic motives, maintain the opposite opinion. But this forgery is scarcely [...] "literary." ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} what Mr. Godwin Austin would say comes next, but {{probably}} rocks containing more ammonites, and more ichthyosauri and plesiosauri, with a vast number of other things; and under that I should meet with yet older rocks, containing numbers of strange shells and fishes; and in thus passing from the surface to the lowest depths of the earth's crust, the forms of animal life and vegetable life which I should meet with in the successive beds would, looking at them broadly, be the more different the further that I <b>went</b> down. Or, <b>in</b> other words, inasmuch as we started with the clear principle, that in a series of naturally-disposed mud beds the lowest are the oldest, we should come to this result, that the <b>further</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> time the more difference exists between the animal and vegetable life of an epoch and that which now exists. That was the conclusion to which I wished to bring you {{at the end of this}} Lecture.|$|R

The dynamic and interaction of mark, line, shape, value and color determine {{the quality and}} meaning of all images, be they carefully planned or wildly spontaneous. Maurice de Sausmarez {{in the introduction to}} his book Basic Design: The dynamics of visual form characterizes Basic Design as “ [...] . an attitude of mind, not a method [...] . A form of inquiry, not a new art form [...] emphatically not an end in itself but a means of making the individual more acutely aware of the expressive resources at his/her command, a fostering of an inquisitiveness [...] . ”. We will be directing our inquiries through 6 explorations that will be undertaken {{over the course of the}} semester. In all of this work the process will be as important as the finished product and will provide the key to what design is about. In addition you will be learning the rudiments of computer imaging by completing the “Against the Clocki tutorial for Adobe Illustrator. We will also look briefly at “Streamline” and “Photoshop” to enable you to work with scans. Familiarity with digital imaging processes is a powerful tool and valuable life skill. You will always have the option of using the computer to do your projects. The design explorations are set up to build on each other, the <b>further</b> along <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the semester the more I will expect you to use what you have learned...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are mostly}} deployed {{in a remote}} working environment, since sensor nodes are small in size, cost-efficient, low-power devices, and have limited battery power supply. Because of limited power source, energy consumption has been considered as the most critical factor when designing sensor network protocols. The network lifetime mainly depends on the battery lifetime of the node. The main concern {{is to increase the}} lifetime with respect to energy constraints. One way of doing this is by turning off redun-dant nodes to sleep mode to conserve energy while active nodes can provide essential k-coverage, which improves fault-tolerance. Hence, we use scheduling algorithms that turn off redundant nodes after providing the required coverage level k. The scheduling algorithms can be implemented in centralized or localized schemes, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. To exploit the advantages of both schemes, we employ both schemes on the network according to a threshold value. This threshold value is estimated on the performance of WSN based on network lifetime comparison using centralized and localized algorithms. To extend the network lifetime and to extract the useful energy from the network <b>further,</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> for compromise <b>in</b> the area covered by nodes...|$|R
60|$|History {{also tells}} us that the field of the supernatural has rewarded its {{cultivators}} with a harvest, perhaps not less luxuriant, but of a different character. It has produced an almost infinite diversity of Religions. These, if we set aside the ethical concomitants upon which natural knowledge also has a claim, are composed of information about Supernature; they tell us of the attributes of supernatural beings, of their relations with Nature, and of the operations by which their interference with the ordinary course of events can be secured or averted. It does not appear, however, that supernaturalists have attained to any agreement about these matters or that history indicates a widening of the influence of supernaturalism on practice, with the onward flow of time. On the contrary, the various religions are, to a great extent, mutually exclusive; and their adherents delight in charging each other, not merely with error, but with criminality, deserving and ensuing punishment of infinite severity. In singular contrast with natural knowledge, again, the acquaintance of mankind with the supernatural appears the more extensive and the more exact, and the influence of supernatural doctrines upon conduct the greater, the <b>further</b> back <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> time and the lower the stage of civilisation submitted to investigation. Historically, indeed, there would seem to be an inverse relation between supernatural and natural knowledge. As the latter has widened, gained in precision and in trustworthiness, so has the former shrunk, grown vague and questionable; as the one has more and more filled the sphere of action, so has the other retreated into the region of meditation, or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal recognition.|$|R
60|$|But our {{knowledge}} of life {{is not confined to}} the existing world. Whatever their minor differences, geologists are agreed as to the vast thickness of the accumulated strata which compose the visible part of our earth, and the inconceivable immensity of the time of whose lapse they are the imperfect, but the only accessible witnesses. Now, throughout the greater part of this long series of stratified rocks are scattered, sometimes very abundantly, multitudes of organic remains, the fossilized exuviae of animals and plants which lived and died while the mud of which the rocks are formed was yet soft ooze, and could receive and bury them. It would be a great error to suppose that these organic remains were fragmentary relics. Our museums exhibit fossil shells of immeasurable antiquity, as perfect as the day they were formed, whole skeletons without a limb disturbed--nay, the changed flesh, the developing embryos, and even the very footsteps of primeval organisms. Thus the naturalist finds {{in the bowels of the}} earth species as well defined as, and in some groups of animals more numerous than, those that breathe the upper air. But, singularly enough, the majority of these entombed species are wholly distinct from those that now live. Nor is this unlikeness without its rule and order. As a broad fact, the <b>further</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> time the less the buried species are like existing forms; and the further apart the sets of extinct creatures are the less they are like one another. In other words, there has been a regular succession of living beings, each younger set being in a very broad and general sense somewhat more like those which now live.|$|R
50|$|The <b>further</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> {{back into}} history, {{the more we}} see {{personality}} disappearing beneath the wrappings of collectivity. And if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> right back to primitive psychology, we find absolutely {{no trace of the}} concept of an individual. Instead of individuality we find only collective relationship or what Lévy-Bruhl calls participation mystique (Jung, 1921 1971: par. 12).|$|R

He said he didn’t look a nice man at all, and he wore ugly boots: so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on <b>further.</b> <b>We</b> <b>went</b> a goodish way without coming across any more hotels, and then we met a man, and asked him to direct us to a few.|$|R
