40|$|Abstract. The {{content of}} {{carbonate}} minerals in Dong Anshan iron ore was increasing in recent years, which deteriorated reverse <b>flotation</b> <b>indices</b> or even resulted in unclear separation between concentrate and tailing. In dodecylamine and sodium oleate systems, reverse flotation tests were undertaken with artificial mixed minerals of martite, quartz and siderite. Based on mineral flotation tests, the effect mechanism of siderite on reverse flotation were investigated {{in terms of}} SEM and EDS. Results showed that siderite was weakly depressed by starch, and the adsorption of siderite on hematite and quartz was the main cause for reverse flotation difficulties. In reverse flotation in dodecylamine system, the adverse effect of siderite on reverse flotation could be reduced when the amount of starch increased, and iron minerals and quartz were separated effectively. Therefore, the reverse flotation in dodecylamine system could be considered to realize separating effectively iron minerals and quartz of Donganshan iron ore containing carbonates, but which had high requirements on pH. Other methods were siderite being separated prior to reverse flotation or inventing flotation agents capable of effectively activating or depressing siderite...|$|R

40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objectives}} {{the study of}} the physical and mechanical characteristics of maize kernels in relation to the contamination by Fusarium sp and by zearalenone in twenty landraces of maize from the southern region of Brazil. From the analyzed samples, 60 % has been considered to have a hard endosperm type and 40 % an intermediary one. A correlation between the physical and mechanical variables was observed as an indication that the higher is the proportion of hard endosperm, more dense will be the kernel and more force for its rupture will be necessary. The level of contamination by Fusarium sp was between 5. 5 and 24. 75 % among the analyzed grains, correlating positively with the <b>flotation</b> <b>index,</b> indicating that the landraces of maize with a softer endosperm can present a higher contamination by this genus.

40|$|International audienceThe Polish copper {{concentrate}} {{subject of}} this study is produced by flotation from a black shale organic rich ore. Due to ore specific properties, <b>flotation</b> <b>indexes</b> have always been poor in the Polish concentrator. Moreover, in the last 5 - 6 years, ore characteristics dramatically changed and the concentrate grades (mostly Cu and As) degraded. As a consequence, research on alternative technologies to pyrometallurgy is necessary. Bioleaching efficiency was already demonstrated during the Bioshale FP 6 European project. However, some improvements were still needed to be achieved in order to meet process economic viability. In the frame of Promine FP 7 European project, our study aimed at improving the profitability of the continuous bioleaching of the copper concentrate in stirred tank reactors. Non traditional operating conditions were tested: high solids concentration (> 20 % solids), reduced agitation and aeration rates. The follow-up of the experiment consisted in both physical parameters measurements (pH, Eh, oxygen uptake rates [...] .) but also in the monitoring of the bacterial population using molecular biology techniques.

40|$|Flotation {{processes}} {{occurring in}} the bulk and froth phases have a characteristic influence on the structural features and dynamics of the flotation froth. It is recognized that the structure and texture of a mineral froth is a good indicator of flotation separation performance. The surface froth feature and dynamics are presented by three features extracted from the digitized images of the froths, i. e. SNE, a rough indication of the average bubble size of the froth, froth stability and the average grey level of the froth, an indication of mineral loading. Particle size is an important parameter in flotation operation. Nowadays, particle size is often measured and controlled in flotation concentrators. In this study the dependence of the froth structures on the particle size variation was investigated on the batch flotation of a sulfide ore from the Merensky reef in South Africa, and the size by size recovery curves were studied as well. In general medium particles produced bubbles smaller than those observed {{in the presence of}} fine and coarse particles, and the recover rates were larger. Entrainment was a contributory mechanism to the recovery of fine particles. The fluctuation of <b>flotation</b> <b>indices</b> on the particle size change can be diagnosed and predicted by the froth structures change {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Articl...|$|R

40|$|The {{characterization}} of platinum group minerals (PGMs) from concentrator flotation circuits provides valuable information towards understanding PGM recovery under given milling and flotation conditions. Additional mineralogical characterization also {{provides information on}} ore variability, which may affect recovery. Considering the low grades involved, automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{characterization of}} PGMs has enabled relatively quick analyses, compared with older, time consuming and less accurate optical microscopy methods. Over the years, parameters, such as species, size distribution, liberation, gangue and base metal sulfide (BMS) associations, {{have been used to}} characterize the PGMs in a process mineralogical context, to aid metallurgical interpretation. This paper considers whether <b>flotation</b> <b>indices</b> determined for PGMs can be empirically validated, using initial results from analysis of PGMs in a concentrate bank from a South African concentrator treating UG 2 ore from the western limb of the Bushveld Complex. The aim is to determine whether floatability is adequately described by these parameters, or whether other mineralogical factors must be considered when assessing PGM floatability, and hence accounting for recovery vs. losses to tails. The data obtained to date, show that flotation parameters (including liberation index, BMS/gangue relationships and size distribution) have merits where large changes in PGM concentration occur, as observed in the first four cells of the concentrate bank. Larger data sets, however, are required to assess floatability, particularly where concentrate cell grades are similar, as observed in the last six cells of the concentrate bank. Furthermore, the floatability indices could be enhanced by the incorporation of selected associated gangue mineral information, chief amongst these being the content and mode of occurrence of naturally floatable talc and associated orthopyroxene...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere are {{nowadays}} {{two principal}} production paths to treat copper ores. Smelting, converting and electrorefining {{have dominated the}} copper industry since the 1800 s and represent 80 % of the copper production. The other 20 % are produced via hydrometallurgy. Research is going on to develop alternative routes to conventional processing {{as there is a}} need to exploit more diverse resources, more complex in composition and with lower grades. The copper concentrate subject of this study is produced by flotation from a black shale organic rich ore. This resource is a carbonate-rich, multi-element (Cu, Ag) and polymineral concentrate. Due to ore specific properties, <b>flotation</b> <b>indexes</b> have always been poor in the concentrator. Moreover, in the last 5 - 6 years, ore characteristics dramatically changed and the concentrate grades (mostly Cu and As) degraded. As a consequence, research on alternative technologies to pyrometallurgy is necessary. The first part of the study consisted in testing nontraditional operating conditions during continuous bioleaching experiments: high solids concentration (> 20 % solids), reduced agitation and aeration rates. For the same residence time, bioleaching performances at high pulp density (25 %) were the same as those reached during previous bioleaching tests at 15 % solid. No mixing or microbial issues were encountered. The bacterial consortium used in the experiments demonstrated a high copper tolerance. The second part of the study was devoted to technology development for metal recovery from copper bearing solutions obtained during bioleaching experiments cited above. Due to the high copper concentration of the leachate, the results obtained show that solvent extraction is not necessary and can be replaced by direct electrowinning. Copper cathodes of proper quality (morphology and composition) are obtained at industrial current densities. The control of Fe(III) content in solution (< 2 g/L) allowed to obtain high electrowining efficiencies (between 90 and 95 %) and low energy consumption factor (~ 2000 kWh/t Cu). Chlorine removal enabled to avoid dendrites and nodules formation in copper cathodes...|$|R

Then, standard screening, FT-IR, XRD and SEM were adopted to characterize the size distribution and flotation of micro-fine Shendong low rank coal. The {{results indicated that the}} size fraction of - 0. 045 mm was the dominant size fraction in raw coal with a yield of 91. 65 % and ash content of 46. 25 %. Flotation of Shendong low rank coal required a larger dosage of collector, 50 kg/t of diesel oil, to achieve a higher combustible matter recovery (63. 25 %) and <b>flotation</b> efficiency <b>index</b> (40. 70 %) accompanied with a significant decrease in ash content (22. 44 percentage points) due to the hydrophilicity of coal surface.

40|$|Abstract The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geometallurgy {{is becoming increasingly}} recognised as a discrete and high-value activity that reflects an ongoing commercial and cultural trend towards more effective mine site integration and optimisation. In recent years, advancement of new quantitative data acquisition techniques has facilitated {{the need for a}} method outlining how to conduct an integrated study to characterise an orebody. Limited publications exist proposing a formalised methodology, and {{there is a lack of}} industry agreement on how to conduct an integrated analysis. This thesis addresses this problem by developing an iterative, integrated method suitable for application in pre-feasibility, feasibility, and operational stages of mine life. The key outcome of the method is the ability to integrate large and complex geological and metallurgical databases to identify intrinsic attributes that affect mineral processing, and then use this understanding to map metallurgical response across a deposit. A key aspect of the proposed method is the application of deterministic modelling of processing attributes to identify intrinsic rock-based controls on metallurgical response. This is done through a multivariate process called class-based analysis and modelling. Classes are multivariate assemblages of samples sharing similar intrinsic characteristics such as mineralogy, texture or structure. Classes may or may not coincide with traditional boundary definitions such as geology or alteration. Class-based analysis facilitates predictive modelling of processing indices by developing discrete class-based models. Results show class-based modelling provides more effective predictive capabilities, compared to universal models, enabling robust predictions of processing performance attributes to be made. This is critical for providing data support necessary for geostatistical modelling of geometallurgical attributes. A trend analysis procedure is applied to class-based modelling predictions to develop processing domains suitable for geostatistical application using currently available techniques. The integrated method incorporates a range of established mathematical and statistical techniques including Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Linear and Non-Linear Regression Modelling, and Cumulative Summation Analysis (cusum). Key outcomes of the proposed method include: 1) Overcoming the lack of optimized geometallurgical domains relevant to processing performance. 2) Improved protocols for relevant metallurgical test data and sample selection. 3) Development of a rigorous approach to identifying parameters controlling processability. 4) Ability to generate greater data support to enable rigorous geostatistical modelling of geometallurgical attributes. The work in this thesis focuses on the Cadia East Copper-Gold porphyry deposit (New South Wales, Australia) as a case study site to demonstrate method application. It is important to note that this thesis is not designed to produce a fully functioning geometallurgical model of the Cadia East deposit, but rather to develop and demonstrate an alternate geometallurgical mapping and modelling approach. The thesis includes two demonstration examples: 1) Demonstration of comminution mapping and modelling: A dataset including assay measurements, petrophysical attributes, rebound hardness measurements, quantitative mineralogy and geological logging information is integrated with 148 comminution measurements obtained from new small-scale geometallurgical tests. Through a series of iterations, identification of critical geometallurgical parameters is made and used to develop proxy support models for comminution indices (A*b, BMWi, and throughput) based on inherent geological variability. 2) Demonstration of flotation recovery mapping and modelling: A dataset of 120 assay and associated flotation performance measurements is analysed to develop proxy support models for <b>flotation</b> recovery <b>indices</b> (i. e. copper and gold rougher and re-cleaner recovery, copper concentrate grade) based on inherent geological variability. If implemented the outcomes of geometallurgical modelling will enable effective management of project risk through robust deposit characterisation by documenting variability within an orebody and quantifying the impact of intrinsic variability on processing performance...|$|R
