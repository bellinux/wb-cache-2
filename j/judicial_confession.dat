6000|$|The King's Counsel {{pointed to}} the woman's declaration; to which the counsel replied--"A {{production}} concocted {{in a moment of}} terror and agony, and which approached to insanity," [...] he said, [...] "his learned brother well knew was no sound evidence against the party who emitted it. It was true, that a <b>judicial</b> <b>confession,</b> in presence of the Justices themselves, was the strongest of all proof, insomuch that it is said in law, that 'in confitentem nullae sunt partes judicis.' But this was true of <b>judicial</b> <b>confession</b> only, by which law meant that which is made in presence of the justices, and the sworn inquest. Of extrajudicial confession, all authorities held with the illustrious Farinaceus and Matthaeus, 'confessio extrajudicialis in se nulla est; et quod nullum est, non potest adminiculari.' It was totally inept, and void of all strength and effect from the beginning; incapable, therefore, of being bolstered up or supported, or, according to the law phrase, adminiculated, by other presumptive circumstances. In the present case, therefore, letting the extrajudicial confession go, as it ought to go, for nothing," [...] he contended, [...] "the prosecutor had not made out the second quality of the statute, that a live child had been born; and that, at least, ought to be established before presumptions were received that it had been murdered. If any of the assize," [...] he said, [...] "should be of opinion that this was dealing rather narrowly with the statute, they ought to consider that it was in its nature highly penal, and therefore entitled to no favourable construction." ...|$|E
40|$|The "Dignitas connubii" Instruction {{confirms}} {{the possibility that}} the judge may admit proof that appears while he is carrying out his labor of gathering proofs. The Instruction obliges the judge to avoid an excessive number of witnesses, and the judge may not permit the presence of the attorneys during the declarations of the witnesses and experts when he considers that the procedure should be held in secret. In the gathering of proofs, any type of fraud, collusion or corruption must be avoided. Other points emphasized in "Dignitas connubii" are that what is understood by <b>judicial</b> <b>confession</b> is very clearly defined, and that truly interesting nuances are added on the subject of preconstituted proof, [...] ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the fairy}} popular creed fell, doubtless, many {{subordinate}} articles of credulity in England, but {{the belief in}} witches kept its ground. It was rooted {{in the minds of}} the common people, as well by the easy solution it afforded of much which they found otherwise hard to explain, as in reverence to the Holy Scriptures, in which the word witch, being used in several places, conveyed to those who did not trouble themselves about the nicety of the translation from the Eastern tongues, the inference that the same species of witches were meant as those against whom modern legislation had, in most European nations, directed the punishment of death. These two circumstances furnished the numerous believers in witchcraft with arguments in divinity and law which they conceived irrefragable. They might say to the theologist, Will you not believe in witches? the Scriptures aver their existence;--to the jurisconsult, Will you dispute the existence of a crime against which our own statute-book, and the code of almost all civilized countries, have attested, by laws upon which hundreds and thousands have been convicted, many or even most of whom have, by their <b>judicial</b> <b>confessions,</b> acknowledged their guilt and the justice of their punishment? It is a strange scepticism, they might add, which rejects the evidence of Scripture, of human legislature, and of the accused persons themselves.|$|R
