25|$|There is now (~2014) a retro {{movement}} {{which is}} {{resulting in a}} slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and <b>internet</b> <b>mail</b> has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than {{the internet as a}} whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with ASCII text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their <b>internet</b> <b>mail</b> and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.|$|E
25|$|UTF-8 {{has been}} the {{dominant}} character encoding for the World Wide Web since 2009, and as of November 2017 accounts for 90.1% of all Web pages. (The next-most popular multibyte encodings, Shift JIS and GB 2312, have 0.8% and 0.6% respectively). The <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> Consortium (IMC) recommended that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8, and the W3C recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in XML and HTML.|$|E

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{patterns of}} productivity in the <b>Internet</b> <b>mailing</b> lists, {{also known as}} discussion lists or discussion groups. Datasets have been collected from electronic archives of two <b>Internet</b> <b>mailing</b> lists, the LINGUIST and the History of the English Language. Theoretical models widely used in informetric research have been applied to fit the distribution of posted mes-sages over the population of authors. The Generalized Inverse Poisson-Gaussian and Poisson-lognormal distributions show excellent results in both datasets, while Lotka and Yule–Simon distribution demonstrate poor-to-mediocre fits. In the mailing list where modera-tion and quality control are enforced to a higher degree, i. e., the LINGUIST, Lotka, and Yule–Simon distributions perform better. The findings can be plausibly explained by the lesser applicability of the success-breeds-success model to the information production in the elec-tronic communication media, such as <b>Internet</b> <b>mailing</b> lists, where selectivity of publications is marginal or nonexistent. The hypothesis is preliminary, {{and needs to be}} validated against the larger variety of datasets. Char-acteristics of the quality control, competitiveness, and the reward structure in <b>Internet</b> <b>mailing</b> lists as com-pared to professional scholarly journals are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Early {{versions}} of Usenet used Duke's A News software, designed {{for one or}} two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called B News that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983). With a message format that offered compatibility with <b>Internet</b> <b>mail</b> and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. C News, developed by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, InterNetNews by Rich Salz was developed {{to take advantage of the}} continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time INN development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had noticed it in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, Erik Naggum was instrumental in ensuring that <b>internet</b> <b>mail</b> used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) {{disclosed}} what {{it called}} an Internet-based [...] "pyramid scam." [...] Its complaint states that customers would pay a registration fee to join a program that called itself an [...] "internet mall" [...] and purchase a package {{of goods and services}} such as <b>internet</b> <b>mail,</b> and that the company offered [...] "significant commissions" [...] to consumers who purchased and resold the package. The FTC alleged that the company's program was instead and in reality a pyramid scheme that did not disclose that most consumers' money would be kept, and that it gave affiliates material that allowed them to scam others.|$|E

2500|$|Usenet {{is a set}} of {{protocols}} for generating, storing and retrieving news [...] "articles" [...] (which resemble <b>Internet</b> <b>mail</b> messages) and for exchanging them among a readership {{which is}} potentially widely distributed. These protocols most commonly use a flooding algorithm which propagates copies throughout a network of participating servers. Whenever a message reaches a server, that server forwards the message to all its network neighbors that haven't yet seen the article. Only one copy of a message is stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to the (typically local) readers able to access that server. The collection of Usenet servers has thus a certain peer-to-peer character in that they share resources by exchanging them, the granularity of exchange however is on a different scale than a modern peer-to-peer system and this characteristic excludes the actual users of the system who connect to the news servers with a typical client-server application, much like an email reader.|$|E
2500|$|The browser {{was then}} {{modified}} and released as Internet Explorer. Microsoft originally released Internet Explorer 1.0 in August 1995 in two packages: at retail in Microsoft Plus! add-on for Windows 95 and via the simultaneous OEM release of Windows 95. Version 1.5 was released {{several months later}} for Windows NT, with support for basic table rendering, an important early web standard. Version 2.0 was released for both Windows 95 and Windows NT in November 1995, featuring support for SSL, cookies, VRML, and Internet newsgroups. Version 2.0 was also released for the Macintosh and Windows 3.1 in April 1996. Version 2 was also included in Microsoft's Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95 in early 1996, which retailed for 19.99 USD and included a how-to book and 30 days of Internet access on MSN among other features. [...] Internet Explorer 3.0 was released free of charge in August 1996 by bundling it with Windows 95, another OEM release. Microsoft thus made no direct revenues on IE and was liable to pay Spyglass only the minimum quarterly fee. In 1997, Spyglass threatened Microsoft with a contractual audit, in response to which Microsoft settled for 8 million USD. Version 3 included <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> and News 1.0 and the Windows Address Book. It also brought the browser {{much closer to the}} bar that had been set by Netscape, including the support of Netscape's plugins technology (NPAPI), ActiveX, frames, and a reverse-engineered version of JavaScript named JScript. Later, Microsoft NetMeeting and Windows Media Player were integrated into the product and thus helper applications became not as necessary as they once were. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were also introduced with version 3 of Internet Explorer.|$|E
2500|$|Version 4 {{released}} in September 1997, was shipped with Windows 95 OSR (OEM Service Release) 2.5, {{and the latest}} beta version of Windows 98 and was modified to integrate more closely with Microsoft Windows. It included an option to enable [...] "Active Desktop" [...] which displayed World Wide Web content on the desktop itself and was updated automatically as the content changed. The user could select other pages for use as Active Desktops as well. [...] "Active Channel" [...] technology was also introduced to automatically obtain information updates from websites. The technology {{was based on an}} XML standard known as Channel Definition Format (CDF), which predated the currently used web syndication formats like RSS. This version was designed to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, and could be downloaded from the Internet, free of charge. It supported Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Outlook Express 4.0 also came integrated into the browser and replaced the aging Microsoft <b>Internet</b> <b>Mail</b> & News product that was released with previous versions. Version 5 came out in March 1999, following Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta versions in late 1998 [...] Bi-directional text, ruby text and direct XML/XSLT support were included in this release, along with enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was {{released in}} June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5.5 was later released for Windows Me in July 2000, and included many bug fixes and security patches. Version 5.5 was the last to have Compatibility Mode, which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run {{side by side with the}} 5.x. With IE6, there was a quirks mode that could be triggered to make it behave like IE5.5 Version 6 was released with Windows XP on August 27, 2001. It mainly focused on privacy and security features, as they had become customer priorities. Microsoft implemented tools that support P3P, a technology under development by the W3C.|$|E
