40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} diseases caused by abnormally conformed infectious proteins, called prions. They can be sporadic (Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease [JCD]), genetic (genetic JCD, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker, and <b>familial</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>insomnia),</b> or acquired (kuru, variant JCD, and iatrogenic JCD). The clinical features associated with each form of prion disease, the neuroimaging findings, cerebrospinal fluid markers, and neuropathological findings are reviewed. Sporadic JCD is {{the most common form of}} human prion disease, and will be discussed in detail. Genetic prion {{diseases are}} caused by mutations in the prion-related protein gene (PRNP), and they are classified based on the mutation, clinical phenotype, and neuropathological features. Acquired prion diseases fortunately are becoming rarer, as awareness of transmission risk has led to implementation of measu res to prevent such occurrences, but continued surveillance is necessary to prevent future cases. Treatment and management issues are also discussed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York...|$|R

500|$|A {{gene for}} the normal protein has been identified: the PRNP gene. In all {{inherited}} cases of prion disease, {{there is a}} mutation in the PRNP gene. [...] Many different PRNP mutations have been identified and these proteins {{are more likely to}} fold into abnormal prion. Although this discovery puts a hole in the general prion hypothesis, that prions can aggregate only proteins of identical amino acid make-up. [...] These mutations can occur throughout the gene. Some mutations involve expansion of the octapeptide repeat region at the N-terminal of PrP. Other mutations that have been identified as a cause of inherited prion disease occur at positions 102, 117 & 198 (GSS), 178, 200, 210 & 232 (CJD) and 178 (<b>Fatal</b> <b>Familial</b> <b>Insomnia,</b> FFI). [...] The cause of prion disease can be , genetic, or infectious, or a combination of these factors. For example, to have scrapie, both an infectious agent and a susceptible genotype must be present.|$|E

40|$|Neuropathological {{diagnostic}} criteria for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) {{and other human}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) are proposed for the following disease entities: CJD - sporadic, iatrogenic (recognised risk) or familial (same disease in 1 st degree relative) : spongiform encephalopathy in cerebral and/or cerebellar cortex and/or subcortical grey matter; or encephalopathy with prion protein (PrP) immunoreactivity (plaque and/or diffuse synaptic and/or patchy/perivacuolar types).

Kuru (in the Fore population). Without PrP data, the crucial feature is the spongiform change accompanied by neuronal loss and gliosis. This spongiform change is characterised by diffuse or focally clustered small round or oval vacuoles in the neuropil of the deep cortical layers, cerebellar cortex or subcortical grey matter, which might become confluent. Spongiform change {{should not be confused}} with non-specific spongiosis. This includes status spongiosus (''spongiform state''), comprising irregular cavities in gliotic neuropil following extensive neuronal (including also lesions of ''burnt-out'' ''spongy'' changes in brain oedema and metabolic encephalopathies, and artefacts such as superficial cortical, perineuronal, or perivascular vacuolation; focal changes indistinguishable from spongiform change may occur in some cases of Alzheimer's and diffuse Lewy body diseases.

40|$|In man, {{mutations}} in {{different regions of}} the prion protein (PrP) are associated with infectious neurodegenerative diseases that have remarkably different clinical signs and neuropathological lesions. To explore the roots of this phenomenon, we created a knock-in mouse model carrying the mutation associated with one of these diseases [Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) ] that was exactly analogous to a previous knock-in model of a different prion disease [fatal <b>familial</b> <b>insomnia</b> (FFI) ]. Together with the WT parent, this created an allelic series of three lines, each expressing the same protein with a single amino acid difference, and with all native regulatory elements intact. The previously described FFI mice develop neuronal loss and intense reactive gliosis in the thalamus, as seen in humans with FFI. In contrast, CJD mice had the hallmark features of CJD, spongiosis and proteinase K-resistant PrP aggregates, initially developing in the hippocampus and cerebellum but absent from the thalamus. A molecular transmission barrier protected the mice from any infectious prion agents that might have been present in our mouse facility and allowed us to conclude that the diseases occurred spontaneously. Importantly, both models created agents that caused a transmissible neurodegenerative disease in WT mice. We conclude that single codon differences in a single gene in an otherwise normal genome can cause remarkably different neurodegenerative diseases and are sufficient to create distinct protein-based infectious elements.

An axillary lymph node was involved by a marked proliferation of T- 3 +/T- 10 [...] lymphocytes admixed with S- 100 +/T- 6 +/Leu- 3 a+/Ia + reticular cells which lacked typical LC granules; cell suspension study revealed that 90 %- 96 % of the lymph node cells were T- 11 +/T- 3 + lymphocytes characterized by low expression of Leu- 3 a and T- 8 antigens and by high expression of Ia antigens (52 %). Peripheral blood T lymphocytes exhibited a similar distribution of surface phenotypes. The patient died of interstitial pneumonia and an autopsy was performed. The thymus was markedly atrophic and completely devoid of lymphocytes. The peri-arteriolar lymphoid sheets of the spleen were poorly developed and were mainly composed of T- 8 + lymphocytes. The mediastinal nodes were rudimentary and were populated by T- 3 +/T- 10 + lymphocytes with low expression of Leu- 3 a and T- 8 antigens. Our results raise the possibility that Omenn's syndrome is a peculiar primary immunodeficiency in which, despite early thymic involution, some abnormal T lymphocytes still develop in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Antigenic triggering of these cells might result in prominent proliferations of T lymphocytes and Langerhans-like cells which lead to the clinical manifestation of the disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Practically {{all data}} on {{familial}} risk in ovarian and other cancers {{are based on}} incident cancer, whereas familiality in cancer mortality is largely unknown. If fatal forms of cancer are a highly familial subtype, then familial risk for mortality may exceed that of incidence, which is relevant for clinical decision making and counseling. METHODS: Ovarian cancer patients in the nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Database were classified according to fatal and nonfatal (incident) family history. Familial risks for incident and fatal ovarian cancer were calculated for offspring based on their parental or sibling family history of any cancer using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incidence and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for mortality. Offspring without family history were referents. RESULTS: The database included 24, 757 mothers and 8138 daughters with ovarian cancer. When a mother had ovarian cancer, the SIR for incident ovarian cancer in daughters was 2. 69, and when a sister had ovarian cancer it was 3. 49. The SMRs for fatal cancer by fatal cancer in probands were 3. 39 and 5. 80, respectively. For fatal serous cancers among siblings, the SMR was 6. 16, compared with 10. 01 for the endometrioid type. Ovarian cancer was associated with maternal (SIR, 1. 22; SMR, 1. 56) and sororal breast cancer (SIR, 1. 27). Another discordant association was between ovarian and paternal prostate cancer (SIR, 1. 12; SMR, 1. 66). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fatal</b> <b>familial</b> risks were higher for concordant ovarian, ovarian-breast, and ovarian-prostate cancers than the corresponding incident risks.

40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is {{the leading}} cause of death in critical care medicine. The syndrome is typified by an exaggerated inflammatory response within the lungs. ARDS has been reported in many species, including dogs. We have previously reported a <b>fatal</b> <b>familial</b> juvenile respiratory disease accompanied by occasional unilateral renal aplasia and hydrocephalus, in Dalmatian dogs. The condition with a suggested recessive mode of inheritance resembles acute exacerbation of usual interstitial pneumonia in man. We combined SNP-based homozygosity mapping of two ARDS-affected Dalmatian dogs and whole genome sequencing of one affected dog to identify a case-specific homozygous nonsense variant, c. 31 C>T; p. R 11 * in the ANLN gene. Subsequent analysis of the variant in a total cohort of 188 Dalmatians, including seven cases, indicated complete segregation of the variant with the disease and confirmed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Low carrier frequency of 1. 7 % was observed in a population cohort. The early nonsense variant results in a nearly complete truncation of the ANLN protein and immunohistochemical analysis of the affected lung tissue demonstrated the lack of the membranous and cytoplasmic staining of ANLN protein in the metaplastic bronchial epithelium. The ANLN gene encodes an anillin actin binding protein with a suggested regulatory role in the integrity of intercellular junctions. Our study suggests that defective ANLN results in abnormal cellular organization of the bronchiolar epithelium, which in turn predisposes to acute respiratory distress. ANLN has been previously linked to a dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in human without pulmonary defects. However, the lack of similar renal manifestations in the affected Dalmatians suggest a novel ANLN-related pulmonary function and disease association...|$|R

50|$|Prion {{diseases}} of humans include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—which {{has four main}} forms, the sporadic (sCJD), the hereditary/familiar (fCJD), the iatrogenic (iCJD) and the variant form (vCJD)—Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, <b>fatal</b> <b>familial</b> <b>insomnia,</b> kuru, and the recently discovered variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. These conditions form a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms. TSEs in non-human mammals include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)—popularly known as 'mad cow's disease'—in cattle and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk.

40|$|Background: Emerging data {{suggested}} a significant <b>familial</b> aggregation of <b>insomnia.</b> We aimed {{to clarify the}} familial aggregation and heritability of insomnia disorder by using structural clinical interviews for the ascertainment of insomnia and psychiatric disorders in a community-based sample. Methods: Seventy-five adolescents with insomnia and their 180 first degree relatives, together with 141 age- and sex-matched non-insomnia controls and their 382 first degree relatives, were recruited. Each subject underwent a structured clinical interview and completed a series of psychometric inventories. The rates of insomnia disorder among the first degree relatives were employed to analyze familial aggregation. Heritability of insomnia was analyzed by SOLAR program as based on father-mother-offspring trios. Results: Our study confirmed a significant <b>familial</b> aggregation of <b>insomnia</b> with a first degree relatives' recurrence risk of 2. 33 for current insomnia and 2. 82 for lifetime insomnia, respectively. The heritability±SE of current and lifetime insomnia disorder was 0. 48 ± 0. 13 and 0. 61 ± 0. 11 (p< 0. 001), respectively, which were higher than insomnia symptoms as estimated by the Insomnia Severity Inventory (h 2 ±SE= 0. 27 ± 0. 09) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (h 2 ±SE= 0. 30 ± 0. 11). After exclusion of comorbid psychiatric disorders, the heritability for current and lifetime primary insomnia was 0. 45 ± 0. 17 (p= 0. 007) and 0. 58 ± 0. 21 (p= 0. 004), respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a significant familial aggregation with a high heritability of insomnia disorder. The strong heritability of insomnia persists despite the exclusion of psychiatric disorders. Further molecular genetic investigation of insomnia is indicated. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are unique transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that have diverse phenotypes {{and can be}} familial, sporadic, or acquired by infection.

This review attempts to classify and characterise sporadic and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) as a function of these two disease determinants. Based on the genotype at codon 129 on both PRNP alleles, the size of protease resistant PrPSc fragments and disease phenotype, we divide sporadic CJD into six subtypes: sCJDMM 1 /sCJDMV 1, sCJDVV 2, sCJDMV 2, sCJDMM 2, sCJDVV 1, and sporadic <b>fatal</b> <b>insomnia</b> (sFI). <b>Familial</b> CJD is classified into many haplotypes based on the PRNP mutation and codon 129 (and other polymorphic codons) on the mutant allele.
