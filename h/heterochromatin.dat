5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces <b>heterochromatin</b> formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing <b>heterochromatin</b> regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a <b>heterochromatin</b> region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. <b>Heterochromatin</b> maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as <b>heterochromatin</b> maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, <b>heterochromatin,</b> is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative <b>heterochromatin,</b> consisting of genes that are organized as <b>heterochromatin</b> only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive <b>heterochromatin</b> that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of <b>heterochromatin.</b> Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to <b>heterochromatin</b> near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of <b>heterochromatin</b> on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells. Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the herpes virus that may act as <b>heterochromatin</b> organization triggers to mediate viral latency.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of <b>heterochromatin</b> are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. Telomeric sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of <b>heterochromatin</b> on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E
5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes in the {{maintenance}} of the organization and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of <b>heterochromatin</b> formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation, causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian species differ {{considerably}} in <b>heterochromatin</b> content and location. <b>Heterochromatin</b> {{is most often}} detected using C-banding. Early studies using C-banding showed that differences in the fundamental number (i.e., the number of chromosome arms) could be entirely due to the addition of heterochromatic chromosome arms. <b>Heterochromatin</b> consists {{of different types of}} repetitive DNA, not all seen with C-banding that can vary greatly between karyotypes of even closely related species. The differences of the amount of <b>heterochromatin</b> among congeneric rodent species may reach 33% of nuclear DNA in Dipodomys species, 36% in Peromyscus species, 42% in Ammospermophilus and 60% in Thomomys species where C-value (haploid DNA content) ranges between 2.1 and 5.6 pg.|$|E
25|$|Facultative <b>heterochromatin,</b> {{which is}} {{sometimes}} expressed.|$|E
25|$|C-banding: Giemsa binds to {{constitutive}} <b>heterochromatin,</b> so it stains centromeres.The name {{is derived}} from centromeric or constitutive <b>heterochromatin.</b> The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. <b>Heterochromatin</b> binds {{a lot of the}} dye, {{while the rest of the}} chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} V synthesizes RNAs {{involved in}} siRNA-directed <b>heterochromatin</b> formation in plants.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{packaged}} in <b>heterochromatin,</b> {{such as the}} Xi, is more condensed than DNA {{packaged in}} euchromatin, such as the Xa. The inactive X forms a discrete body within the nucleus called a Barr body. The Barr body is generally located {{on the periphery of}} the nucleus, is late replicating within the cell cycle, and, as it contains the Xi, contains <b>heterochromatin</b> modifications and the Xist RNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{karyotype}} of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80, {{consisting of}} {{three pairs of}} macrochromosomes, 36 pairs of microchromosomes, {{and a pair of}} sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs are submetacentric, while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or (for the smallest microchromosomes) probably telocentric. The submetacentric chromosomes and the Z (female) chromosome show rather little constitutive <b>heterochromatin</b> (C bands), while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds <b>heterochromatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Constitutive <b>heterochromatin,</b> {{which is}} never expressed. It is located around the {{centromere}} and usually contains repetitive sequences.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{the usual}} gene repression, some organisms go in for {{large-scale}} elimination of <b>heterochromatin,</b> or other kinds of visible adjustment to the karyotype.|$|E
25|$|Karyotype {{variability}} in mammals is mainly {{due to the}} varying amount of <b>heterochromatin</b> in each mammal. Once the amount of heterochomatin is subtracted from total genome content, all mammals have very similar genome sizes.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin {{changes are}} a {{plausible}} {{explanation for the}} co-regulation seen in clusters. Chromatin consists of the DNA strand and histones that {{are attached to the}} DNA. Regions were chromatin is very tightly packed are called <b>heterochromatin.</b> <b>Heterochromatin</b> consists very often of remains of viral genomes, transposons and other junk DNA. Because of tight packing the DNA is almost unreachable for the transcript machinery, covering deleterious DNA with proteins {{is the way in which}} the cell can protect itself. Chromatin which consists of functional genes is often an open structure were the DNA is accessible. However, most of the genes are not needed to be expressed all the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{inactive}} X chromosome {{does not}} express {{the majority of}} its genes, unlike the active X chromosome. This is due to the silencing of the Xi by repressive <b>heterochromatin,</b> which compacts the Xi DNA and prevents the expression of most genes.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{epigenetic}} processes include paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, position effect, DNA methylation reprogramming, transvection, maternal effects, {{the progress}} of carcinogenesis, many effects of teratogens, regulation of histone modifications and <b>heterochromatin,</b> and technical limitations affecting parthenogenesis and cloning.|$|E
25|$|This {{level of}} {{chromatin}} structure {{is thought to}} be the form of <b>heterochromatin,</b> which contains mostly transcriptionally silent genes. EM studies have demonstrated that the 30nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10nm fiber ("beads-on-a-string") structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin {{diminution}} (founding father: Theodor Boveri). In this process, {{found in}} some copepods and roundworms such as Ascaris suum, portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells. This process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain <b>heterochromatin</b> regions are lost. In A. suum, all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a widespread}} mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation. In eukaryotes the structure of chromatin, controlled by the histone code, regulates access to DNA with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and <b>heterochromatin</b> areas.|$|E
25|$|The deepest {{layer in}} the {{kinetochore}} is the inner plate, which is organized on a chromatin structure containing nucleosomes presenting a specialized histone (named CENP-A, which substitutes histone H3 in this region), auxiliary proteins and DNA. DNA {{organization in the}} centromere (satellite DNA) {{is one of the}} least known aspects in vertebrate kinetochores. The inner plate appears like a discrete <b>heterochromatin</b> domain throughout the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists’ understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, Murray Barr and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of “nucleolar satellites, which they observed {{were present in the}} mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed <b>heterochromatin,</b> but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.|$|E
25|$|The genomic loci {{and length}} of certain types of small {{repetitive}} sequences are highly variable from person to person, which {{is the basis of}} DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. The heterochromatic portions of the human genome, which total several hundred million base pairs, are also thought to be quite variable within the human population (they are so repetitive and so long that they cannot be accurately sequenced with current technology). These regions contain few genes, and it is unclear whether any significant phenotypic effect results from typical variation in repeats or <b>heterochromatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} {{modifications}} act as docking modules for related factors is {{borne out by}} histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive <b>heterochromatin).</b> It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein HP1 recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{may affect}} the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed <b>heterochromatin.</b> This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.|$|E
25|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NORstains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive <b>heterochromatin,</b> which usually lies near the centromere, and NORstaining highlights the satellites and stalks of acrocentric chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Acetylated histones, octameric {{proteins}} that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent {{a type of}} epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing {{the interaction of the}} N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as <b>heterochromatin.</b> Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.|$|E
25|$|Anti-centromere {{antibodies}} {{are associated}} with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis and proximal scleroderma. There are six known antigens, which are all associated with the centromere; CENP-A to CENP-F. CENP-A is a 17kDa histone H3-like protein. CENP-B is an 80kDa DNA binding protein involved in the folding of <b>heterochromatin.</b> CENP-C is a 140kDa protein involved in kinetochore assembly. CENP-D is a 50kDa protein of unknown function, but may be homologous to another protein involved in chromatin condensation, RCC1. CENP-E is a 312kDa protein from the kinesin motor protein family. CENP-F is a 367kDa protein from the nuclear matrix that associates with the kinetochore in late G2 phase during mitosis. CENP-A, B and C antibodies are most commonly found (16–42% of systemic sclerosis) and {{are associated with}} Raynaud's phenomenon, telangiectasias, lung involvement and early onset in systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomes {{in humans}} {{can be divided}} into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and {{allosome}} (sex chromosome(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided {{a great deal of information}} about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced <b>heterochromatin</b> regions.|$|E
500|$|The gray-tailed vole is monotypic, {{but there}} are some {{differences}} between specimens obtained {{on either side of the}} Columbia River. It appears to be a sibling species of the montane vole (Microtus montanus) or of Townsend's vole (M. townsendii). It was classified as a geographic race or subspecies of the montane vole by Hall and Kelson in 1951, but laboratory analyses, including electrophoresis and karyotype evaluations, subsequently confirmed that they are two separate species. [...] The karyotypes of the montane vole and the gray-tailed vole are dissimilar in terms of homology in 6 of 22 autosomal arms. [...] The quantity and distribution of <b>heterochromatin</b> among both X chromosomes and autosomes is different as well. [...] The two species are allopatric, but not contiguously so.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heterochromatin,</b> which {{consists}} of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. <b>Heterochromatin</b> can be further distinguished into two types: ...|$|E
2500|$|Differences {{in degree}} and {{distribution}} of heterochromatic regions. [...] <b>Heterochromatin</b> stains darker than euchromatin. [...] <b>Heterochromatin</b> is packed tighter. [...] <b>Heterochromatin</b> consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of Adenine-Thymine pairs. [...] Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain. Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of Guanine-Cytosine pairs. The staining technique using giemsa staining is called G banding and therefore produces the typical [...] "G-Bands".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heterochromatin</b> {{contains}} {{a small number}} of genes and densely staining nodules in or along chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|The red {{viscacha}} rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has {{a record}} C-value among mammals—9.2 pg. Although tetrapoidy was first proposed to be a reason for its high genome size and diploid chromosome number, Svartman et al. showed that the high genome size {{was due to the}} enormous amplification of <b>heterochromatin.</b> Although one single copy [...] gene was found to be duplicated in its genome, data on absence of large genome segment duplications (single paints of most Octodon degu probes) and repetitive DNA hybridization evidence rules against tetraploidy. The study of <b>heterochromatin</b> composition, repeated DNA amount and its distribution on chromosomes of octodontids is absolutely necessary to define exactly what <b>heterochromatin</b> fraction is responsible for the large genomes of the red viscacha rat.|$|E
