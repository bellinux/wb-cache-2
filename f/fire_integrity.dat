50|$|Spray {{fireproofing}} {{of structural}} steel is most efficiently accomplished before interior partitions are built, otherwise {{a conflict with}} fire stops in firewalls could result. Firestops must adhere to the bare, dry, unobstructed surfaces of the fire barrier which is penetrated (e.g., metal decking), or adjacent to an interface of two fire barriers at which fire stopping is required (e.g., beams). Spray fireproofing cannot be applied prior to fire stopping at these surfaces, as the fireproofing would obstruct adherence of the fire stop materials to the fire barrier surfaces. Spraying the upper room perimeter with fireproofing may also result in covering of wall/ceiling joints and through penetrations that require fire stopping. These joints are then not visually observed and not provided with proper fire stopping, violating the <b>fire</b> <b>integrity</b> of the passive fire barrier.|$|E

The geometry of elastomer spacer joints {{is important not}} only for their load capacity under normal conditions - thickness, width, and cavity depth can also influence {{fire resistance}} performance.

Significant weight savings {{can be accomplished by}} replacing steel with fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) sandwich panels. An assessment is then necessary to ensure that equivalent fire safety is provided, since these structures are combustible. To support such assessments, this paper presents results from vertically loaded fire resistance tests of two structures: (1) a “conventional” FRP sandwich bulkhead with thermal insulation (providing load carrying fire resistance for 60 minutes) and (2) a multiple core FRP sandwich bulkhead without insulation. Both bulkheads were constructed for and tested with the same design load. The multiple core sandwich bulkhead demonstrated structural <b>fire</b> <b>integrity</b> performance well beyond 60 minutes whilst having a significantly lower structural weight and thickness. The new type of multiple core sandwich structure thus provides great potential, both from a weight-savings and a fire safety perspective...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the compact low-temperature analogue burner designed for <b>fire</b> <b>integrity</b> testing. The low-temperature analogue burner has been improved {{in order to}} make the test procedures easier, faster and more accurate. The use of a thermally thin faceplate at the burner nozzle eliminates the requirement for a warm up phase that was previously required and thus negates the need for a shutter. Less helium and time is needed for the whole operation. The new compact burner also provides improved accessibility for instrumentation and camera views. A new image processing technique has been developed to simultaneously map the distributions of heat transfer coefficient (h) and adiabatic wall temperature (Taw) across the surface of the model using multiple liquid crystal coatings and varying gas temperatures. Measurements of h and Taw distributions made on a flat plate using the compact burner are reported. Copyright © 2001 by ASME...|$|E

A modern projectile was adopted for this study. In-bore projectile responses at various locations of the projectile while traveling through the simulated gun tubes were obtained.

30|$|Taken together, {{the tests}} {{described}} in this report highlight {{a number of important}} construction details and potential construction errors which may appear inconsequential to a building contractor, but which may have a profound impact on the structural <b>fire</b> response and <b>integrity</b> of a building during fire. Examples of this include <b>integrity</b> of <b>fire</b> stopping during large deformations, lapping of steel reinforcing mesh, anchorage of steel reinforcing mesh over shear studs on protected perimeter beams, use of deformed versus smooth bars for reinforcement (potentially leading to strain localization and tensile failure of deformed steel bars during fire), proper anchorage and grouting of hollowcore slabs, use of specific types of bolted steel connections to promote connection ductility and rotational capacity during fire, quality, uniformity, and robustness of structural fire protection materials (either passive or intumescent), and so on. Serious unknowns continue to surround many, if not all, of these issues, and {{there is a need for}} testing to support the development of best practice guidance which can be used to provide quality assurance programs on construction sites of so-called ‘fire engineered’ buildings.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} sensor {{networks}} has enabled {{a vast number}} of sensor-based applications such as monitoring forest <b>fires,</b> ensuring structural <b>integrity</b> of buildings or bridges, monitoring homes or offices, and others. However, sensor network application developers are often scientists, office workers, doctors, or homeowners, and not computer programmers, often not even engineers. Thus, setting up a sensor network can be cumbersome or costly. In this paper, we discuss experiments utilizing a set of electronic blocks, called eBlocks, that developers can use to build small-scale monitor-control systems. eBlocks are intended for non-experts and do not require any programming or electronics experience. To enable the design of useful systems, eBlocks must support some logic function and some state functions. We previously developed an intuitive logic block and demonstrated its successful use by nonexperts. In this paper, we introduce our basic set of state function blocks – prolong, toggle, trip, and pulse – and we demonstrate their successful use by nearly two-hundred non-expert users. Given a description of a desired system’s behavior, more than 50 %, and in some cases 75 % or 85 %, of non-experts could correctly choose, connect and configure each of those state blocks in a short 10 -minute or less time period. ...|$|R
30|$|The DNA {{replication}} checkpoint has {{a surveillance}} function that regulates origin <b>firing,</b> maintains the <b>integrity</b> of the stalled replication fork, and prevents cells from proceeding to mitosis before {{completion of the}} DNA replication (McNeely et al. 2013). The replication checkpoint pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotes. In mammalian cells an initial defect is sensed by a protein kinase, termed ATR, which transmits signals to Chk 2 effector kinase. In fission yeast, the replication checkpoint requires the ATR ortholog Rad 3 and Chk 2 ortholog Cds 1 (McGowan and Russell 2004). In budding yeast, the checkpoint effector kinase Rad 53 directly interacts with Asf 1 and regulates chromatin assembly to promote cell survival against DNA damage and replication block (Sharp et al. 2005). Although {{little is known about}} the mechanism, CAF- 1 is associated with the full activation of the Chk 1 -dependent checkpoint pathway upon a replication stress in vertebrate cells (Takami et al. 2007). These reports indicate the importance of histone assembly in the S-phase checkpoint response. In budding yeast, hyperacetylation of H 3 K 56, a hallmark of replication-associated lesions, results in activation of Rad 53 (Maas et al. 2006). Deacetylation of H 4 tail is required for inactivation of Cds 1 upon replication stress in fission yeast (Kunoh et al. 2008), suggesting that the acetylation status of histones could affect the checkpoint response. However, how the acetylation status affects histone assembly and thereby checkpoint maintenance in response to the replication block remains unsolved.|$|R

The object is to be certified according to the standard ISO 17799 - 1 during 2003. Among other things updating means that the company will be provided with contingency plans who should insure a reliable IT-environment. Basically it is all about protecting the company’s information related systems, ensure contingency in the daily work and maintaining the trust of the market and the authorities. The aim of the Thesis was to apply existing methods in the making of contingency plans. The plans are focused on the information related systems that are critical to the company and takes in consideration the threats, which might stop them from operating as desired. The contingency plans cover a limited numberof systems, which for example handle e-mail and order intake. The plans comprise the servers and platforms (for example operating systems), which are essential to the systems. The Thesis is focused on the aspect of availability. The aspects of confidentiality (for example <b>fire</b> walls) and <b>integrity</b> (for example access restrictions) are handled by the company’s own personnel. To ensure contingency is only a minor part of the work that needs to bee done before a company can be certified according to ISO 7799 - 1.

40|$|Muscle fibers from {{individuals}} with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis generate repetitive trains of action potentials (myotonia) or large depolarizations and block of spike production (paralysis) when the extracellular K+ is elevated. These pathologic features {{are thought to}} arise from mutations of the sodium channel alpha subunit which cause a partial loss of inactivation (steady-state Popen approximately 0. 02, compared to < 0. 001 in normal channels). We present a model that provides a possible mechanism for how this small persistent sodium current leads to repetitive <b>firing,</b> why the <b>integrity</b> of the T-tubule system is required to produce myotonia, and why paralysis will occur when a slightly larger proportion of channels fails to inactivate. The model consists of a two-compartment system to simulate the surface and T-tubule membranes. When the steady-state sodium channel open probability exceeds 0. 0075, trains of repetitive discharges occur in response to constant current injection. At {{the end of the}} current injection, the membrane potential may either return to the normal resting value, continue to discharge repetitive spikes, or settle to a new depolarized equilibrium potential. This after-response depends on both the proportion of noninactivating sodium channels and the magnitude of the activity-driven K+ accumulation in the T-tubular space. A reduced form of model is presented in which a two-dimensional phase-plane analysis shows graphically how this diversity of after-responses arises as extracellular [K+] and the proportion of noninactivating sodium channels are varied...|$|R
40|$|Post-earthquake fires (PEF) {{especially}} in densely populated urban {{areas have been}} catastrophic in recent seismic events. It {{appears to be an}} important design load which has not been considered critical by most design standards. Moreover, current performance-based seismic design philosophy permits certain level of damage to a structure based on the assumed design seismic hazard. These damaged structures are extremely vulnerable to post-earthquake fires. Even after the outbreak of <b>fire,</b> the structural <b>integrity</b> of the damaged structure must be intact for sufficient duration enabling the firefighters to evacuate and extinguish the fire in the affected building. The recent performance-based design, necessitates evaluation of the fire resistance level of earthquake damaged building with or without the outbreak of post-earthquake fire. In this study an integrated seismic and thermal analysis model was developed using the sequential thermal–structural analysis scheme using the finite element program, ABAQUS. A simple portal frame was considered to investigate the global behaviour of the frame and determine post-earthquake fire resistance. A 2 D transient heat transfer analysis was conducted and the transient nodal temperatures across the structural elements cross sections were stored for subsequent thermal structural analyses. The state of earthquake inflicted damage, corresponding to desired performance level was realized using pushover analysis. The results of the simplified 2 D model matched reasonably well with that of 3 D finite element model considered for validation study. The developed model is being used for subsequent study to investigate the multi-story moment resisting frames with fire scenarios resulting in asymmetric heating of the frame...|$|R
30|$|Existing fire policy {{encourages}} {{the maintenance of}} ecosystem <b>integrity</b> in <b>fire</b> management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level) approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity. Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires, which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on {{the degree to which}} those species depend on fire and accommodate their specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus [Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis [Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland <b>fire</b> for ecosystem <b>integrity</b> and species viability with strategic deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. South Africa {{is ranked}} {{as one of}} the most biologically diverse {{countries}} in the world. In comparison it has more species of vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals per 1000 km² than Africa and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, statistics indicate that this biological diversity is becoming increasingly threatened by various anthropocentric activities in South Africa. It can be concluded that South Africa has the highest number of red data species in the world, as well as the second highest number of endemic taxa. The numbers of extinct, endangered, rare, and vulnerable species have increased exponentially over the past 10 - 15 years. South African legislation provides directives to ensure measures are taken to provide for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. However, the trends in the conservation status of various South African species have raised the question of whether this legislation can adequately sustain biodiversity for future use. Biodiversity needs to be preserved for sustainable future use due to the instrumental and intrinsic value it holds for society. Various criteria should be complied with to ensure that biodiversity is sustained for future generations. In this research project a consortium of criteria was identified relevant to ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity and its conservation. These criteria pertain to the marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, fresh water and biological environment and may directly or indirectly reflect on the integrity of biodiversity. This consortium of aspects included marine harvesting, marine protection, marine pollution, air pollution, human population growth, development, land pollution, aquatic pollution, hydrological <b>integrity,</b> <b>fire</b> management, terrestrial protection, and agricultural management. These focus areas included numerous internationally recognised strategic and detailed aspects, and also additional measures relevant to the South African context. South African legislation was evaluated against these aspects to determine its compliance with these issues. The results concluded that South African legislation makes provision for various strategic aspects that are needed to sustain biodiversity. However, legislation failed to address a few strategic and some important detail aspects, such as the regulation of marine harvesting, marine protection, control over marine pollution, management of human population growth, regulation of development, hydrological integrity, and terrestrial protection. Smaller lacunae were discovered in air pollution control, fire management, land and aquatic pollution control, the management of agricultural activities, fragmented administration of legislation between government spheres, and the effectiveness of provincial legislation to regulate biodiversity protection in all provinces. The author recommended the formation of the National Interdepartmental Biodiversity Body to ensure integrated management of issues that relate to the environment and biodiversity. Other recommendations include: integration and fusion of provincial legislation to ensure equal protection of biodiversity in all provinces; national integration of international commitments into relevant statutes; and the formation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Agency to regulate the quality of environmental impact assessments. Detailed recommendations were aimed at improving specific aspects under various environmental acts. Doctora...|$|R
