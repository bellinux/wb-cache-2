40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that alterations in axonal transport {{play a critical}} role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology, but the molecular mechanisms that control this process are not understood fully. Recent work indicates that presenilin 1 (PS 1) interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3 � (GSK 3 �). In vivo, GSK 3 � phosphorylates kinesin light chains (KLC) and causes the release of kinesin-I from membrane-bound organelles (MBOs), leading to a reduction in kinesin-I driven motility (Morfini et al., 2002 b). To characterize a potential role for PS 1 in the regulation of kinesin-based axonal transport, we used PS 1 �/ � and PS 1 knock-in M 146 V (<b>KI</b> <b>M</b> 146 V) mice and cultured cells. We show that relative levels of GSK 3 � activity were increased in cells either in the presence of mutant PS 1 or in the absence of PS 1 (PS 1 �/ �). Concomitant with increased GSK 3 � activity, relative levels of KLC phosphorylation were increased, and the amount of kinesin-I bound to MBOs was reduced. Consistent with a deficit in kinesin-I-mediated fast axonal transport, densities of synaptophysinand syntaxin-I-containing vesicles and mitochondria were reduced in neuritic processes of <b>KI</b> <b>M</b> 146 V hippocampal neurons. Similarly, we found reduced levels of PS 1, amyloid precursor protein, and synaptophysin in sciatic nerves of <b>KI</b> <b>M</b> 146 V mice. Thus PS 1 appears to modulate GSK 3 � activity and the release of kinesin-I from MBOs at sites of vesicle delivery and membrane insertion. These findings suggest that mutations in PS 1 may compromise neuronal function by affecting GSK- 3 activity and kinesin-I-based motility.

To give the information to the general population in the early phase of outbreak can sometimes be difficult due to lack of data. The information might be too much or too little and it is necessary to update the information. Giv ing “fair information ” to the general population is very impor tant. To disguise fact should be avoided and this is the challenge for public health worker during epidemic. As noted by Davis et al. [3], “effective pandemic control requires a systematic dia logue with the publics. ”At this phase, when the information is still incomplete, it is important to set up an information center to gathering all data and further analyzing and distributing it to governmental policy maker, health care worker and general population [4].

Tyrosine {{was used as}} substrate {{as it is the}} first substrate in the melanogenesis process.

The methodology is designed for the evaluation of the inhibitory potency of the most frequently used active substances in cosmetic marketed products against hyperpigmentation such as kojic acid, azelaic acid and benzoic acid.

Ascorbic acid is also investigated as it interrupts the synthesis pathway of melanin by reducing the melanin intermediate dopaquinone back to l-dopa.

Tradicionalni, progresistični in poenotujoči literarnozgodovinski vidik te raznolikosti ne more ustrazno razložiti. Razprava ga nadomešča s prelomno-mutacijskim vidikom rayličnih razmerij, <b>ki</b> nastajajo <b>med</b> literaturo moderne in njenim (foucaultovskim) "premičnim temeljem", to je romantičnim dojemanjem subjekta in romantičnim idejno-strukturnim tokom simbolizacije. A {{literary}} history glossary for {{the literature of}} the Moderne: revision and some suggestions. The literature of the Moderne period aesthetically communicates a metaphysical crisis, or a diversity of co-existing conceptions of the subject. The traditional, progressivist and unifying {{literary history}} view cannot properly account for this diversity. The article replaces it with a discontinuous-mutational view of different relationships that occur between {{the literature of the}} Moderne and its (Foucaultist) "shifting foundation"- that is, the romantic conception of the subject and the romantic symbolising current of ideas/structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{elucidate}} the transport mechanisms responsible for elimination of micafungin, a new semisynthetic echinocandin antifungal agent, which is predomi-nantly cleared by biliary excretion in humans and rats. In vitro studies using sandwich-cultured rat and human hepatocytes were conducted. Micafungin uptake occurred primarily (75 %) by trans-porter-mediated mechanisms in rat and human. Micafungin uptake into hepatocytes was inhibited by taurocholate (<b>Ki</b> 61 <b>M),</b> Na depletion (45 – 55 % reduced), and 10 M rifampin (20 – 25 % reduced); these observations support the involvement of Na-taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/Ntcp) and, to a lesser extent, or-ganic anion-transporting polypeptides in the hepatic uptake of mica-fungin. The in vitro biliary clearance of micafungin, as measured by the B-CLEAR technique, amounted to 14 and 19 l/(min mg protein) in human and rat, respectively. In vitro biliary excretion of micafungi...|$|R
