For each distributed transaction such <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> need to execute the available atomic commitment protocol.|$|R

The data collected during a clinical trial forms the basis of subsequent safety and efficacy analysis which in turn drive decision making on product development in the pharmaceutical industry. The clinical <b>data</b> <b>manager</b> is involved in early discussions about data collection options and then oversees development of data collection tools based on the clinical trial protocol. Once subject enrollment begins, the <b>data</b> <b>manager</b> ensures that data is collected, validated, complete, and consistent. The clinical <b>data</b> <b>manager</b> liaises with other data providers (e.g. a central laboratory processing blood samples collected) and ensures that such data is transmitted securely and is consistent with other data collected in the clinical trial. At the completion of the clinical trial, the clinical <b>data</b> <b>manager</b> ensures that all data expected to be captured has been accounted for and that all data management activities are complete. At this stage, the data is declared final (terminology varies, but common descriptions are [...] "Database Lock" [...] and [...] "Database Freeze"), and the clinical <b>data</b> <b>manager</b> transfers data for statistical analysis.|$|E

40|$|Twelve {{institutional}} <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> {{were asked}} to independently code the data from a patient chart of one patient in an ovarian cancer trial. They abstracted data from the medical record and filled out three types of trial forms (on-study, chemotherapy, and summary forms). The analysis of the processed data revealed that the median rate of errors was 13 % for the 12 <b>data</b> <b>managers.</b> The error rate differed among the types of trial forms. The factors causing these errors were mistakes in interpretation, documentation, and coding. The level of experience of the <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> {{proved to be an}} important factor. It became clear that the documentation in the medical record was inadequate. We conclude that <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> as well as physicians involved in cancer clinical trials need specific training and that the quality of data management in cancer clinical trials is an important issue for further investigation...|$|R

This presented a considerable challenge for <b>data</b> <b>managers.</b> Two unique {{aspects of the}} CLPX data management process include participation of data specialists in field data collection and identification of one person, the ‘data wrangler’, to coordinate the acquisition of the entire collection of the experiment data. These unique aspects increased the quality and completeness of the overall CLPX collection. <b>Data</b> <b>managers</b> were guided by basic data management principles from the literature, including consideration of potential future users and applications and an imperative to keep data as simple and as flexible as possible. These principles guided data management decisions about data formats, data integration, data presentation, and documentation. This principle-based approach improved the usability and long-term viability of CLPX data. It is recommended that <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> be involved early in the planning of future large-scale field experiments and that <b>data</b> <b>managers</b> develop appropriate principle-based rubrics for guidance through persistent data-management challenges...|$|R
