The overhead stream from the [...] splitter is product propylene and the bottom stream is propane which is sent back to the furnaces for cracking or used as fuel.|$|E

Badak NGL Bontang, East Kalimantan. With the aim to obtain stable analysis results as required. From the results obtained for the repeatability value 0. 104 % methane component, 0. 036 % ethane component and 0. 154 % propane components and reproducibility values obtained for the methane component of 0. 025 %, 0. 036 % component ethane, and propane components 0. 014 %. Data analysis of the samples obtained test results are still below thelimit allowed by the method of GPA 2261 - 64 which found samples with good homogeneity so that the analysis becomes stable and the true value can be resposibility and laboratory as a Quality Control can keep reliability for LNG Plant.

40|$|Natural gas is a {{good source}} of various {{hydrocarbon}} compounds, but, alkanes with three or more number of carbon atoms in there chain are of greater value as fuels as well as pure components. A cryogenic plant is setup to recover propane, butane, and other heavier alkanes with two operating distillation columns; de-methanizer and <b>de-ethanizer.</b> The available software Aspen Plus is used to simulate this cryogenic plant to serve the purpose of recovery. This software facilitates us to infer the impact of the operating variables on the efficiency of the plant. The use of cryogenic plants for this purpose is a latest project carried on just by a few companies, so the idea here is to analyse the operating variables to optimize the recover...|$|E
40|$|The modeling, simulation, {{and dynamic}} {{optimization}} of an industrial reaction system for acetylene hydrogenation {{are discussed in}} the present work. The process consists of three adiabatic fixed-bed reactors, in series, with interstage cooling. These reactors are located after the compression and the caustic scrubbing sections of an ethylene plant, characterizing a front-end system; in contrast to the tail-end system where the reactors are placed after the <b>de-ethanizer</b> unit. The acetylene conversion and selectivity profiles for the reactors are optimized, taking into account catalyst deactivation and process constraints. A dynamic optimal temperature profile that maximizes ethylene production and meets product specifications is obtained by controlling the feed and intercoolers temperatures. An industrial acetylene hydrogenation system is used to provide the necessary data to adjust kinetics and transport parameters and to validate the approach...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} {{that the price of}} {{liquefied}} petroleum gas (LPG) is higher than that of natural gas from which it is derived. So the modification of a natural gas plant to produce LPG instead of lighter hydrocarbon gases is very important in the view point of economics. The aim of the present work is directed to the modification of Salam gas plant (Khalda Petroleum Company-Egypt) to produce LPG from the NGL instead of producing hydrocarbon gases during the NGL stabilization. This can be achieved after adding <b>de-ethanizer</b> and de-butanizer towers. The simulation tool used in this study is HYSYS version 8. 4. The produced LPG of 100  ton/day can participate to solve the LPG shortage problem in Egypt and provide a national service to the people of Matruh Governorate. The economic study based on the economic analyzer of HYSIS showed that the pay-back period of the added two towers and their additional equipment has a high investment strength which means that all modification costs will be recovered within a short time. Furthermore, there are other benefits from this modification. The simulation results showed that there is a capacity saving of 56  tons/day in the export pipeline which transfers the gases to western desert gas complex (WDGC) at Alexandria. In the same manner, the modified plant provides a capacity saving of 88  tons/day in the dehydration unit and reduces horse power consumption in recycle and first stage export compressors. This modification can be taken as guidelines for both new and plants in operation to increase their profits...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to optimize the thermal performance of a fractionation unit within a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. Typical fractionation units in an LNG facility consisting of three distillation columns, namely <b>de-ethanizer,</b> de-propanizer and de-butanizer were used in this study. A hierarchical approach is developed to optimizing the system. In this approach, increasing levels of model complexity are used and various thermal targets are set and implemented. The column targeting tool available within the simulation package of Aspen Plus software was used to optimize a fractionation unit in an LNG facility. First, integrated thermal analysis was used in identifying design targets for improvements in energy consumption and efficiency. The column targeting tool is used in the design of distillation columns by setting targets to reduce utility cost, improve energy efficiency, reduce capital investment and facilitate column debottlenecking. Starting from a short-cut distillation design calculation using the DSTWU method which is based on the well-known Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland correlations, the minimum and actual reflux ratios, minimum and actual number of stages, optimum feed location and condenser and reboiler duties were estimated. These estimates were used as starting points in the rigorous fractionation column design method RADFRAC available in Aspen Plus. The column Grand Composite Curve (CGCC) for each column was generated to give an insight of the actual operation and guide the optimization process. Starting with appropriate feed placement, the CGCC will show the scope for reflux ratio modification by increasing the number of stages. Feed would be either preheated or precooled due to the availability of sharp enthalpy change in the condenser or reboiler side. Finally, the scope for a side condensing or side reboiling can be identified from the area beneath or above the CGCC pinch point...|$|E
