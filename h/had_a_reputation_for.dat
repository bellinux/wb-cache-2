As a result, {{throughout}} {{the first six months}} of 1889, Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir Auckland Colvin, that he desired only gratitude and also because Tyler <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.|$|E
