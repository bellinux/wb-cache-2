5|$|Clash {{has stated}} that {{although}} children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> pertinent to his work, and that it came through in his performances.|$|E
5|$|Franz Oppenhoff was {{appointed}} Mayor of Aachen by the Allies on 31 October, but after his <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> leaked, Franz Oppenhoff was assassinated on Heinrich Himmler's orders in Unternehmen Karnival (Operation Carnival) on March 25.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> {{introduced}} {{in advance for}} each contestants. If he/she's skilled-vocalist, his/her real <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> on the left, And if he/she's tone-deaf, his/her real <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> on the right. One contestant must be eliminated in this round.|$|R
5000|$|Using Lie algebra {{homology}} and Adams operations, {{a twisted}} denominator <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> given for each element. These <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> {{related to the}} McKay-Thompson series Tg {{in much the same}} way that the Koike-Norton-Zagier <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> related to J.|$|R
40|$|We {{critically}} {{examine the}} claim by Otávio Bueno (Bueno O. 2014. “Why <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> fundamental”. American Philosophical Quarterly 51, 325 - 332) that <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental concept. Bueno advances four related theses {{in order to}} ground such a claim: 1) <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> presupposed in every conceptual system; 2) <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> required to characterize an individual; 3) <b>identity</b> cannot <b>be</b> defined; 4) the intelligibility of quantification requires identity. We address each of these points and argue {{that there are no}} compelling reasons to hold that <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> fundamental in these cases. So, in the end, <b>identity</b> may not <b>be</b> a fundamental concept after all...|$|R

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Maxwell made several attempts to enlist, but was unsuccessful due to his age, and deteriorating health. He eventually travelled to Queensland, where he enlisted under the alias of Joseph Wells on 27 June 1940. However, his <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> soon discovered and he was given a training position; dissatisfied, he took his discharge on 9 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{sentiment}} {{associated with}} an identity can change to befit the kinds of events in which that <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> involved, when situations keep arising where the <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> deflected in the same way, especially when <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> informal and non-institutionalized.|$|R
5000|$|Corporate <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from organizational identity {{in that it}} is more concerned with the visual (graphic <b>identity)</b> and <b>is</b> more a function of leadership (Hatch & Schultz, 1997). Organizational <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> more concerned with the internal (employee relationships to the organization) and corporate <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> concerned with the external (marketing) (Hatch & Schultz, 1997).|$|R
50|$|In all years, it was {{observed}} that an LGB <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> most common among London residents and those aged under 35. Homosexual <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> twice more common among men than among women, whereas bisexual <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> more common among women than men.|$|R
5|$|An {{apprentice}} boilermaker {{before the}} war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 {{and worked as}} a gardener. In 1932, he published Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences. Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War, Maxwell was rejected on the grounds of his age before enlisting under an alias in Queensland; his <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> discovered, and after a short period in a training position, he sought discharge. In 1967, aged 71, he died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Author Alexander C. Irvine {{adapted the}} script into a novel, also titled Iron Man 2, that was {{released}} in April 2010. Prior to the film release, Marvel Comics released a four issue miniseries comic book titled Iron Man vs Whiplash, which introduced the film's version of Whiplash into the Marvel Universe. A three issue prequel miniseries titled Iron Man 2: Public <b>Identity</b> <b>was</b> released in April.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> an {{equation}} {{which is true}} for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. Many <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> known in algebra and calculus.

40|$|AbstractA new {{technique}} for discovering and proving combinatorial <b>identities</b> <b>is</b> introduced. A bridgework showing {{the connection between}} this technique and covering systems of congruences is developed. New bijective proofs of the Vandermonde and Saalschütz <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> given and other 'discovered' <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> given as examples of this technique...|$|R
5|$|Eris (minor-planet {{designation}} 136199 Eris) is {{the most}} massive and second-largest dwarf planet known in the Solar System. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory-based team led by Mike Brown, and its <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> verified later that year. In September 2006 it was named after Eris, the Greek goddess of strife and discord.|$|E
5|$|Following the documentary, Yousafzai {{was interviewed}} on the {{national}} Pashto-language station AVT Khyber, the Urdu-language Daily Aaj, and Canada's Toronto Star. She made a second appearance on Capital Talk on 19 August 2009. Her BBC blogging <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> being revealed in articles by December 2009. She also began appearing on television to publicly advocate for female education.|$|E
5|$|The {{score for}} the Bourne <b>Identity</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} by John Powell. Powell was bought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded a more traditional orchestral {{score for the}} film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since {{a lot of the}} music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell's score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues to give them a 'cinematic' quality.|$|E
5000|$|Anchor tables {{contain a}} single column in which <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> stored. An <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> {{assumed to be}} the only {{property}} of an entity that is always present and immutable. As <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> rarely available from the domain being modeled, they are instead technically generated, e g from an incrementing number sequence.|$|R
50|$|People act {{to verify}} or confirm their identities {{and in doing}} so they bring about a {{situation}} in which perceived meanings are consistent with their identity standard. If the <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> a role <b>identity,</b> then the behavior that brings about the changes in the situational meanings to make them consistent with the <b>identity</b> standard <b>is</b> appropriate role behavior. If the <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> a group or category based identity, the behavior which verifies the <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> the behavior that maintains group boundaries and divisions in the social structure. By verifying identities, people create and maintain the social structure in which the <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> embedded(Burke,2007).|$|R
50|$|Omani {{society is}} largely tribal. Oman has three known types of identities. Two of these <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> 'tribalism and Ibadism', the third <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> linked to 'maritime trade'. The first two <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> {{widespread}} {{in the interior of}} Oman, these <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> closely tried to tradition, as a result of lengthy periods of isolation. The third identity, which pertains to Muscat and the coastal areas of Oman, <b>is</b> an <b>identity</b> that has become embodied in business and trade. The third <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> generally seen to be more open and tolerant towards others. Thus, tension between socio-cultural groups in Omani society exists. More important is the existence of social inequality between these three groups.|$|R
5|$|Alpha Flight's Northstar was {{the first}} major gay {{character}} in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 {{as a member of the}} original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.|$|E
5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate their <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had {{information}} that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E
50|$|A two-sided {{identity}} (or just <b>identity)</b> <b>is</b> {{an element}} {{that is both}} a left and right identity. Semigroups with a two-sided <b>identity</b> <b>are</b> called monoids. A semigroup may have at most one two-sided identity. If a semigroup has a two-sided identity, then the two-sided <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> the only one-sided identity in the semigroup. If a semigroup has both a left identity and a right identity, then it has a two-sided <b>identity</b> (which <b>is</b> therefore the unique one-sided identity).|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} other hypergeometric {{function}} <b>identities</b> <b>were</b> discovered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A 20th century contribution to the methodology of proving these <b>identities</b> <b>is</b> the Egorychev method.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{concept to}} expand on <b>is</b> <b>identity.</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>is</b> {{directly}} connected with the identity management theory since it helps define what this theory is trying to explain. Even though <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> a very broad topic, I will discuss personal identity {{through the lens of}} the individual, which will than effect its social <b>identity.</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>is</b> said to be the [...] "distinct personality of an individual" [...] <b>identity.</b> <b>Identity</b> can <b>be</b> the view that people hold about themselves. Also, <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> the perception that people hold about themselves in a social setting. Identity has many subtopics that distinguish why this theory is specific and different from other identity theories. Specific characteristics explain how people feel about themselves as an individual and in a social setting.|$|R
5|$|Following {{reconstitution}} {{into the}} Territorial Army in 1920, the Liverpool Scottish formalised {{its relationship with}} the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and transferred in 1937 to become the regiment's second territorial battalion. In comparison to the densely urbanised region that the King's Regiment encompassed in north-west England, the Cameron Highlanders area of recruitment in the Highlands was sparsely populated. Although it had its numerical designation omitted, the battalion's <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> preserved and headquarters at Fraser Street, Liverpool were retained. During a royal visit to Liverpool in 1938, George VI presented the battalion with new colours at Everton Football Club's Goodison Park stadium.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} option, he quotes Panyasis, who states that King Theias of Assyria had a {{daughter}} called Smyrna. Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her into a tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1960, the Australian Army {{adopted the}} Pentropic divisional structure, {{which was based}} on the {{establishment}} of five-company battalions. The result of this was a {{reduction in the number of}} CMF units, many of which were merged to form new units on the Pentropic establishment. At the same time, it was decided to amalgamate the old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments, such as the Royal Victoria Regiment. As a result of these changes, in July the 6th Battalion was merged with the 5th Battalion and the 58th/32nd Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (1 RVR); within this organisation the 6th Battalion's <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> maintained by 'C' (Melbourne) Company. Prior to this, in March, the battalion had received the Freedom of the City from the City of Melbourne.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} [...] - [...] specifically, {{differential geometry}} [...] - [...] the Bochner <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> an <b>identity</b> concerning harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. The <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> {{named after the}} American mathematician Salomon Bochner.|$|R
40|$|A general typological {{model for}} the {{analysis}} of collective <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> outlined and applied to the case of German and Japanese national identity. Primordial, civic and cultural codes of boundary construction are described with respect to their logic of exclusion, corresponding ritual etc. German national <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> presented as a cultural project carried by the 'Bildungsburgertum', whereas the Japanese <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> presented as a combination of primordial and civic elements...|$|R
50|$|Internarrative <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> {{building}} {{upon the}} notion of narrative Identity, the idea that our <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> shaped by the accounts we give of our lives. The central tenet of internarrative <b>identity</b> <b>is</b> that the ability of individuals to shape their lives is extended by multiple autobiographical narratives with associative principles beyond temporality. This concept was developed in 1997 by Ajit K. Maan in the central text Internarrative Identity.|$|R
