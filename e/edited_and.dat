40|$|RNA <b>editing</b> <b>and</b> {{alternative}} splicing are two processes that increase protein diversity. The {{relationship between the}} two processes is not well understood. There are a few examples of correlations between <b>editing</b> <b>and</b> {{alternative splicing}}, but these are all nearby effects. A search for alternative splicing among 16 edited genes in Drosophila reveals two novel instances of alternative splicing. In one example where alternative splicing occurs downstream of editing, a strong correlation between <b>editing</b> efficiency <b>and</b> splice site selection is observed. In contrast, when editing occurs downstream of alternative splicing, no correlation is seen. These results suggest some models for the coupling of <b>editing</b> <b>and</b> splicing processes...|$|R
