5|$|Occasionally a Portia <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> {{or injured}} while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. P. labiata <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> in 2.1% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 3.9%, P. schultzi <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> in 1.7% and injured but not killed in 5.3%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may lose one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E

5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he <b>is</b> <b>killed</b> by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
