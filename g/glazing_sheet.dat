40|$|Abstract:- Much {{effort has}} been spent on the {{development}} of hybrid PVT, in order to improve it efficiency of both, thermal and cell. The combination of thermal and cell efficiencies, which is commonly known as “total efficiency of the PVT”, is influenced by many system design parameters and operating conditions. Due to that, seven new design configurations of absorber collectors are designed, investigated and compared. Simulations were performed to determine the best absorber design that gives the highest efficiency (total efficiency). In these simulations, the system is analyzed with various parameters, such as solar radiation, ambient temperature, and flow rate conditions. It is assumed that the collector is represented as a flat plate thermal collector with single <b>glazing</b> <b>sheet.</b> Based on these simulations, spiral flow design proved to be the best design with the highest thermal efficiency of 50. 12 % and corresponding cell efficiency of 11. 98 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The main {{motivation}} of combining the Photovoltaic (PV) and Thermal collector(T) to be Photovoltaic/Thermal collector systems (PV/T) {{is to increase}} the efficiency of the collectors. It is known fact that the efficiency of the Photovoltaic decreases when the ambient temperature increased and vice verse. The system works by absorbing the heat gain from the sun using the Photovoltaic panel and convert it to electrical energy. Some of this energy is then transfered to the absorber collector underneath the Photovoltaic panel as a waste energy. Special conFigureurations of absorber collector has been designed, investigated and compared before it is inserted underneath the Photovoltaic panel which is represented as flat plate polycrystalline silicon with single <b>glazing</b> <b>sheet.</b> Simulation has been performed to determine the absorption of the heat that influences the total efficiency of the system under certain range of conditions [...] The simulation results shows that it can generates the total efficiency of 63. 55 % with electrical efficiency of 11. 39 % at ambient temperature set between 21 to 36 °C, fluid flow rate at 0. 02 kg/s and solar radiation between 700 to 800 W/m 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: – Simulations {{have been}} {{performed}} to investigate the effect of various mass flow rates against the thermal, electrical and combination of both photovoltaic thermal efficiencies of three absorber collectors design. The first collector, known as Spiral flow absorber collector, the second collector, known as Web absorber collector and the third collector, known as Oscillatory absorber collector. In this simulation, {{it is assumed that}} the absorber collectors are attached underneath the flat plate single <b>glazing</b> <b>sheet</b> of polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic module and water {{has been used as a}} heat transfer medium in absorber collectors respectively. The simulation results shows that the Single flow absorber collector generates combined PV/T efficiency of 64 % with electrical efficiency of 11 %, the Web absorber collector generates combined PV/T efficiency of 44 % with electrical efficiency of 5. 9 % and the Oscillatory absorber collector generates combined PV/T efficiency of 40 % with electrical efficiency of 5. 4 %. The mass flow rate is set at 0. 011 kg/s for all absorber collectors. It is recommended for PV/T system to further improve its efficiency by optimizing the contact surfaces between the solar panel (photovoltaic module) and the absorber collector underneath...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of mass flow rates on the electrical, thermal and combined of photovoltaic thermal efficiencies of the hybrid collectors. Approach: Two photovoltaic thermal solar collectors were designed and fabricated. The first collector, known as spiral flow absorber collector, designed to generate hot water and electricity. The second collector, known as single pass rectangular tunnel absorber collector designed to generate hot air and electricity. Both absorber collectors were fixed underneath the flat plate single <b>glazing</b> <b>sheet</b> of polycrystalline silicon PV module. Water {{was used as a}} heat transfer medium in spiral flow absorber collector and air for the Single pass rectangular tunnel absorber collector respectively. Results: The experiment results showed that the single flow absorber collector generates combined PV/T efficiency of 64 %, electrical efficiency of 11 % and power maximum achieved at 25. 35 W. Moreover, Single pass rectangular tunnel absorber collector generated combined PV/T efficiency of 55 %, electrical efficiency of 10 % and maximum power of 22. 45 W. Conclusion/Recommendations: The best mass flow rate achieved for spiral flow absorber collector is 0. 011 kg sec− 1 at surface temperature of 55 % and 0. 0754 kg sec− 1 at surface temperature of 39 °C for single pass rectangular collector absorber.

40|$|Polycarbonate <b>glazing</b> <b>sheets</b> {{used to be}} {{protected}} by a film. Earlier fire investigations cases suspected ignition of polycarbonate is due to igniting the protective film. Therefore, polycarbonate materials with and without a protective coating were tested by a cone calorimeter under radiative heat fluxes of 10 kWm- 2 to 70 kWm- 2. In addition to thermal properties, smoke toxicity upon burning the materials was also studied. Values of lethal toxic potency LC 50 deduced by measuring only carbon monoxide will be discussed. The calculation procedure with a cone calorimeter is clarified. It is found that polycarbonate would not be ignited under flashover heat flux at floor level of 20 kWm 2. However, the sample would be ignited and then burned {{when there is a}} protective film. Smoke emitted will be more toxic in having lower value of LC 50. Results confirmed that materials protected by the coating film might have a higher fire risk. Finally, a three-dimensional risk diagram with three parameters x, y, and z on flashover propensity, total heat released per unit area, and LC 50 are proposed for hazard assessment.

60|$|Snow-houses.--Few {{travellers}} have habitually made snow-houses, except Sir J. Franklin's {{party and}} that of Dr. Rae. Great praises are bestowed on their comfort by all travellers, but skill and practice are required in building them. The mode of erection of these dome-shaped buildings is as follows:--It is to be understood that compact, underlying snow {{is necessary for the}} floor of the hut; and that the looser textured, upper layer of snow, is used to build the house. First, select and mark out the circular plot on which the hut is to be raised. Then, cut out of that plot, with knives, deep slices of snow, 6 inches wide, 3 feet long, and of a depth equal to that of the layer of loose snow, say one or two feet. These slices are to be of a curved shape, so as to form a circular ring when placed on their edges, and of a suitable radius for the first row of snow-bricks. Other slices are cut on the same principle for the succeeding rows; but when the domed roof has to be made, the snow-bricks must be cut with the necessary double curvature. A conical plug fills up the centre of the dome. Loose snow is next heaped over the house, to fill up crevices. Lastly a doorway is cut out with knives; also a window, which is <b>glazed</b> with a <b>sheet</b> of the purest ice at hand. For inside accommodation there should be a pillar or two of snow to support the lamps.|$|R
