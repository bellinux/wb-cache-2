50|$|Tokyo-X is a Japanese {{breed of}} {{domestic}} pig, bred for high quality pork production. It is unusual for its <b>marbled</b> <b>meat,</b> seldom seen in pork.|$|R
50|$|Some unscrupulous purveyors {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of the improved appearance in an attempt to pass it off as the higher-quality naturally <b>marbled</b> <b>meat,</b> especially in environments such as restaurants, where the meat's packaging and labelling are not visible to customers.|$|R
50|$|Red Angus {{have all}} of the {{characteristics}} of Black Angus. The cows are hardy, and grow quickly. They produce <b>marbled</b> <b>meat</b> like that of the Black Angus, and their meat is also highly desired in butchers, supermarkets, restaurants, and in the home. While the Red Angus is different in color, their meat is no {{different from that of the}} Black Angus.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 8 mm, its {{diameter}} 13 mm. The solid shell has a depressed shape. Its outer lip is thin. The color pattern is white or yellowish, <b>finely</b> <b>marbled</b> all over with black, gray or ashen, sometimes {{with a series of}} white blotches at the periphery. The basal callus is white, yellow, reddish or black. The smooth surface is polished. The low spire is conical and acute. The 6 to 7 whorls are slightly convex. They are separated by simple, linear sutures. The body whorl widens very rapidly. It is large, dilated, flat on the base, except for the large circular callus, which is excessively heavy and convex. The aperture is oval-truncate.|$|R
50|$|Hog's Breath's Cafe is {{essentially}} a Steakhouse that promotes prime rib as its signature dish. These steaks have been slow cooked for 18 hours in a special oven. The steaks start at medium rare and are also recommended at that particular meat temperature. Due {{to the amount of}} fats retained in the steaks, these steaks have a higher fat content than most steaks and are sometimes classified as <b>marbled</b> <b>meat.</b> The restaurant/cafe chain also sells pasta, burgers, wraps, salads and seafood dishes as well as their signature side dish curly fries, referred to by the chain as Hog's Tail Fries.|$|R
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and <b>marbled</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, UK grocery {{retailer}} Asda, {{owned by}} Wal-Mart, introduced Wagyu beef {{at the end}} of 2011 under its Butcher’s Selection line using meat from a herd in Yorkshire, [...] "bred from Holstein dairy cows impregnated with Wagyu semen". This not only made the beef more affordable, but it also resulted in less <b>marbled</b> <b>meat</b> more familiar to UK consumers. In June 2014, the German discounter Aldi announced {{that it was going to}} introduce Wagyu beef steaks, [...] "with every store receiving a limited number of 50 steaks, priced at a very competitive £6.99 for an 8-oz (225-g) sirloin and rib eye". However, Aldi’s Wagyu beef was sourced from New Zealand, where the exclusively grass-fed cattle are allowed to roam, more in keeping with changing norms around animal welfare (in Japan cattle are [...] "confined in small pens and given much more energy-dense feed").|$|R
40|$|After my 1960 {{synopsis}} of the peculiar subfamily Schoenoteninae from South Asia, I {{was able to}} bring together some additional material of these insects. In order not to postpone their identification too much, I intend to deal with diverse collections separately. The material collected by the Netherlands Stars Range Expedition, 1959, has been treated recently elsewhere (Diakonoff, 1972). The present pages deal with a part of the Schoenoteninae, picked out by me in 1972 from the vast collection of the unidentified material in the British Museum (Natural History) of London (BM). In total 21 species and one subspecies are recorded below, of which 10 species are described as new. I am grateful to the Trustees, to Dr. Klaus Sattler and Mr. C. Moreby, of that Museum, for the opportunity to study this material and for the permission to retain a few duplicates for the collection of the Leiden Museum (LM). The figures were made by Mr. A. C. M. van Dijk, The Hague. Rhabdotenes dacryta spec. nov. (fig. 1) ♀ 20 mm. Head white, vertex touched with grey. Palpus long; white, basal half of upper edge of median segment and entire upper edge of terminal segment grey. Thorax white. Abdomen snow-white. Fore wing with raised scale-tufts; rather broad, costa moderately curved at base, very gently so beyond base, apex obtusely pointed, termen almost straight, hardly concave, little oblique. White, <b>finely</b> <b>marbled</b> with pale fuscous-grey. Costa with ten blackish-grey dots, first spot alternating with minute marks, suffused; other well-defined, gradually becoming larger, paler and more vertical posteriorly, along apical half of costa: dentoid; thre...|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} made {{a blaze of}} light and colour, almost as if a rainbow had suddenly descended into the market-place, when, one fine morning, the shutters were taken down from the new shop, and the two windows displayed their decorations. On one side, there were the variegated tints of collared and <b>marbled</b> <b>meats,</b> set off by bright green leaves, the pale brown of glazed pies, the rich tones of sauces and bottled fruits enclosed in their veil of glass--altogether a sight to bring tears {{into the eyes of}} a Dutch painter; and on the other, there was a predominance of the more delicate hues of pink, and white, and yellow, and buff, in the abundant lozenges, candies, sweet biscuits and icings, which to the eyes of a bilious person might easily have been blended into a faery landscape in Turner's latest style. What a sight to dawn upon the eyes of Grimworth children! They almost forgot to go to their dinner that day, their appetites being preoccupied with imaginary sugar-plums; and I think even Punch, setting up his tabernacle in the market-place, would not have succeeded in drawing them away from those shop-windows, where they stood according to gradations of size and strength, the biggest and strongest being nearest the window, and the little ones in the outermost rows lifting wide-open eyes and mouths towards the upper tier of jars, like small birds at meal-time.|$|R
50|$|The South Devon {{had been}} {{established}} as a breed by the year 1800. With a light red coat, they were powerfully built and supplied rich milk and good beef, <b>finely</b> grained and <b>marbled,</b> and were relied upon to pull ploughshares {{until well into the}} nineteenth century. Careful selection of breeding stock improved the breed considerably. The South Devon Herd Book Society was founded in 1891 when it was recognised by the government as an official body, and the South Devons become one of the fourteen breeds of cattle whose herd books date back to {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|Oval-oblong in contour, the {{two sides}} are about equally curved. The surface is shining, very densely and {{minutely}} striate {{in the direction of the}} whorls. The color is very deep blackish-olive with white dots, or <b>finely</b> variegated and <b>marbled</b> all over with gray and olive-brown. Under a lens it is finely articulated on the striae. The shell contains three whorls and a minute spire not projecting beyond the general outline of the shell. The oval aperture is very large. The columellar and lip margins are equally curved. The upper end is rounded with a pearly callus filling the angle. The interior is nacreous, with blue-green and fiery-red reflections ...|$|R
