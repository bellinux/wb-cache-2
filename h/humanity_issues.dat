50|$|In {{this section}} the FilmFest {{presents}} committed and groundbreaking feature films and documentaries that {{stand up for}} tolerance and <b>humanity.</b> <b>Issues</b> {{that as far as}} the organizers are concerned are being neglected and tend to disappear behind general statements and lip service. This is where the FilmFest comes in, inviting the audience {{to take part in a}} discussion about peace and all its implications, reaching from international conflicts to inner-social differences and domestic problems. We aim at filling the notion of peace with tangible contents and at going further than the superficial observation of current, social developments as practiced by the media, in order to inform the audience, to make them more susceptible to these issues and to make them question their own set of behavior. During the selection process and the compilation of the program the team does not only judge by formal standards, but also puts great emphasis on the thematic compatibility of the films and their potential to enrich each other.|$|E

Primary schools in Australia are considered to develop critical thinking based instruction as reported in some studies. Therefore the teacher and student interaction is investigated to see the features and construct of effective classroom interaction effective for developing students’ critical thinking. The kind of qualitative method chosen is exploratory case study. It aims at carefully revealing the development of student’s critical thinking triggered by teacher and student interaction. The result of this study shows that the instruction is characterized by inquiry based learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning, Socratic questioning, within integrated learning method and added by educational values such as character building and the implementation of social justice education. The finding also shows the politeness strategies portrayed in the teachers’ modeling the ‘respect’ in the classroom interaction.

40|$|In the UK {{approximately}} 1. 2 {{million people}} are estimated to have a mild to moderate learning disability (LD); however, they are historically underrepresented in research. Whilst there’s {{a small but growing}} evidence base for Compassion Focussed Therapy (CFT) in adult populations, there’s no published research regarding its use with people with LD. A mixed methods case study project explored the experience of three participants with LD and anxiety undertaking a programme of CFT. Measures of self-compassion, anxiety and depression were administered pre-intervention, post-intervention and at three-month follow-up. Post-intervention interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings were then combined to develop mixed methods inferences. Findings showed that participant anxiety reduced significantly. Participants experienced this reduction as a categorical change in the self. There was limited evidence for overall changes in their understanding and experience of self-compassion. In addition, they appeared to understand mindfulness as a tool to use when experiencing acute distress. Participants appeared to be developing a greater sense of common <b>humanity.</b> <b>Issues</b> raised include possible diagnostic overshadowing leading to high levels of anxiety at referral, the value of mixed methods research in the field and the value of a hermeneutic understanding of the researcher’s role in analysing data from people with LD. In summary, this research is the first to examine the function of CFT in adults with LD. It suggests that CFT may have a role in clinical practice, but as always more research is neede...|$|E

Our funding was received late in the fiscal year, allowing little time to accomplish our goals before the end of March and continue to plan into the next year.
