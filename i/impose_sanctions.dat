5|$|The {{international}} community helped install a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation in April 1997, but UNITA {{did not allow}} the regional MPLA government {{to take up residence}} in 60 cities. The UN Security Council voted on 28 August 1997, to <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a no-fly zone. The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on 12 June 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4587 would cost $7 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant.|$|E

The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.|$|E

25|$|Philippine Labor Migration Policy has {{historically}} focused on removing barriers {{for migrant workers}} to increase accessibility for employment abroad.

The standards are set by the ILO, which is an UN agency that 185 of the 193 UN members are part of. Labor standards vary greatly depending on host country regulations and enforcement. One of the main reasons for the large differences in labor standards {{is due to the fact}} that ILO only can register complaints and not <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on governments.|$|E

Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the United Nations Security Council to <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically {{from the rest of the}} global community. In 2009, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.|$|E
