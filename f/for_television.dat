40|$|The 2009 Update of the Tipping Point report {{estimates}} {{that there are}} 234 million items of e-waste in or {{on their way to}} landfill. The Report shows that a recycling scheme <b>for</b> <b>televisions</b> and computers would create 2, 570 jobs nationally by the year 2015. This could be increased to 6, 190 new jobs if all electronic waste items were included. Environment Victoria Campaigner Fraser Brindley said that e-waste recycling made economic sense. “The government’s own figures show that a recycling scheme <b>for</b> <b>televisions</b> and computers would have a net economic benefit,” Mr Brindley said. “We’ve shown that this will translate into thousands of green collar jobs across the country. ” Mr Brindley also said that a recycling scheme <b>for</b> <b>televisions</b> and computers was a good start, but that the federal government should include all other e-waste in the future. “Televisions and computers are only 38 % of the e-waste going to landfill,” Mr Brindley said. “We also need to deal with the mountains of mobile phones, printers, games consoles, videos and stereo that are not being recycled. ” This 2009 Update follows the release of the consultation regulatory impact statement (RIS) <b>for</b> <b>televisions</b> and computers. This is a government process that will inform the 5 November 2009 meeting of the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC), at which Ministers have promised to announce a recycling scheme <b>for</b> <b>televisions</b> and computers.
