5|$|Another kind of {{piezoelectric}} transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the resonator itself. This kind <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for torsional vibration modes and {{is called a}} torsional transducer.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Brendli played {{football}} in {{middle and high}} schoolat Patchogue Medford highschool. Brendli <b>is</b> <b>good</b> friends with his former Spirit Squad teammate Nick Nemeth (better known as Dolph Ziggler), and the two lived together in Florida until 2008. On June 1, 2008, Brendli was arrested for {{driving under the influence}} in Florida. He was released the next day after posting US$500 bail.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto <b>is</b> <b>good</b> {{at helping}} {{to defend against}} opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E
60|$|It {{is better}} to be {{beautiful}} than to <b>be</b> <b>good,</b> but it <b>is</b> better to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> than to <b>be</b> ugly.|$|R

5|$|Hennigan {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California in a {{neighborhood}} called Westchester {{and grew up in}} Palos Verdes Peninsula, where he attended high school. He graduated from the University of California, Davis in 2002 with a film major. Hennigan <b>is</b> <b>good</b> friends with fellow professional wrestlers The Miz, Zack Ryder, Dolph Ziggler, Jeff Hardy, Randy Orton, and Matt Cappotelli.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|Killing Is My Business... and Business <b>Is</b> <b>Good!</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth {{released}} on June 12, 1985 {{by the independent}} record label Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. After spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol and food, the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album themselves. Despite the resulting poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is My Business... and Business <b>Is</b> <b>Good!</b> played {{an essential role in}} establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, violence, and occultism.|$|E

5|$|Life <b>Is</b> <b>Good</b> {{features}} personal subject matter, {{themes of}} adulthood and nostalgia, and reflections on Nas' {{personal life and}} experience in hip hop. His rapping {{is characterized by a}} relaxed, plainspoken flow, internal rhymes, and a tone that veers from malicious to nostalgic and introspective. The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples.|$|E
5|$|Lure {{coursing}} is a {{sport for}} dogs based on hare coursing, but involving dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of hare coursing suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing <b>is</b> <b>good</b> athletic exercise for their dogs, {{it does not}} approximate the testing vigour and sport of live coursing.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, Mr. Burns and Jacqueline {{attempt to}} marry. However, Grampa crashes the {{ceremony}} and asks that Jacqueline marry him instead. Partly due to Mr. Burns' boorish behavior, she decides not to marry either man. Deciding that Jacqueline decision <b>is</b> <b>good</b> enough for him, Grampa grabs her and they run out of the church and onto on a bus.|$|E

5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{prognosis}} <b>is</b> <b>good</b> in most patients, {{with one}} study showing recovery occurring in 94% and 89% {{of children and}} adults, respectively (some having needed treatment). In children under ten, the condition recurs in {{about a third of}} all cases and usually within the first four months after the initial attack. Recurrence is more common in older children and adults.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of DST {{generally}} {{argue that}} it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for business. Groups that tend to support DST are urban workers, retail businesses, outdoor sports enthusiasts and businesses, tourism operators, and others who benefit from increased light during the evening in summer.|$|E
