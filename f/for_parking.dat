5|$|In a {{controversial}} move, WMATA announced that {{as part of}} a new cashless parking payment system, SmarTrip would {{be the only way to}} pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> at Metro-operated garages and lots effective June 28, 2004, after reports of widespread theft by Metro's parking contractor, Penn Parking.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} prompted {{complaints that}} Metro was inconveniencing its many customers, including tourists and other infrequent users, {{who did not}} own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target. WMATA has since {{announced that it will}} make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} 42 Metrorail {{stations}}, Metro offers parking for commuters. Most lots are on a first-come, first-served {{basis and}} fill up quickly each day. Thirty-four stations offer reserved parking, with customers purchasing permits to park in specified spaces. Three Metrorail stations (Greenbelt, Huntington, and Franconia-Springfield) have spaces reserved for multi-day parking for up to ten days. Parking fees are paid by SmarTrip card, but 19 stations also accept credit cards. Cash payments are not accepted <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> fees.|$|E

5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
5|$|The Yoyogi National Gymnasium is {{situated}} in an open area in Yoyogi Park on an adjacent axis to the Meiji Shrine. The gymnasium and swimming pool were designed by Tange for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which were the first Olympics held in Asia. Tange began his designs in 1961 and the plans were approved by the Ministry of Education in January 1963. The buildings were placed to optimize space available <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> and to permit the smoothest transition of incoming and outgoing people.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville's {{boundaries}} are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX railroad tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Alcoa's early {{developers}} considered {{public parks}} {{an essential part}} of the city, and in the 1920s, ALCOA sought to set aside 1 acre of land <b>for</b> <b>parks</b> <b>for</b> every 100 people living in the city. In the early 1930s, City Manager Hultquist used idle plant workers <b>for</b> <b>park</b> construction, and over the years, the company continued donating land <b>for</b> <b>park</b> construction and expansion. In 1998, a 3 mi section of the Maryville-Alcoa Greenway was completed, connecting Alcoa's Springbrook Park with Maryville's Bicentennial Greenbelt Park.|$|R

5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it <b>for</b> <b>parking.</b> Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E
