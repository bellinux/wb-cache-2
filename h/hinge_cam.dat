40|$|AbstractAppliance {{manufacturers}} have traditionally performed physical testing using prototypes to assess reliability and service integrity of new product designs. However, for white goods where service lives are measured in years or decades, {{the use of}} endurance testing to analyze long time reliability is uneconomical. As accelerated life testing (ALT) is more efficient and less costly than traditional reliability testing, the methodology is finding increased usage by appliance manufacturers. In the present study, a simulation-based ALT approach was used to predict the service life of a polyacetal <b>hinge</b> <b>cam</b> from a consumer refrigerator. A predictive life stress model based on cumulative surface wear under accelerated stress conditions was developed and used to predict time to failure under consumer use. Results show that the life stress model demonstrated good agreement with performance testing data and reasonably predicts hinge life...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} common configuration, there is a cam or wheel {{at the end of}} each limb. The shape of the cam may vary {{somewhat}} between different bow designs. There are several different concepts of using the cams to store energy in the limbs, and these all fall under a category called bow eccentrics. The four most common types of bow eccentrics are Single Cam, Hybrid Cam, Dual Cam and Binary Cam. However, there are also other less common designs, like the Quad <b>Cam</b> and <b>Hinged.</b> <b>Cams</b> are often described using their [...] "let-off" [...] rating. As a cam is rotated, the force required to hold the bow in position reaches a peak and then decreases as the bow approaches maximum extension (a position known as [...] "the wall"). The percent-difference between the maximum force encountered during the draw and the force required to hold the bow in full extension is the [...] "let-off". This value is commonly between 65% and 80% of the peak weight for recently designed compound bows, although some older compound bows provided a let-off of only 50% and some recent designs achieve let-offs in excess of 90%.|$|R

While {{neither of them}} affected hormone binding, with marginal effects on hormone response, scFv 13 B 1 stimulated LHR in a dose-dependent manner, whereas MAb PD 1. 37 acted as an inverse agonist of TSHR. Moreover, PD 1. 37 could decrease the basal activity of <b>hinge</b> region <b>CAMs,</b> but had varied effects on those present in ECLs, whereas 13 B 1 was refractory to any CAMs in LHR. Using truncation mutants and peptide phage display, we compared the differential roles of the hinge region cysteine box- 2 / 3 {{as well as the}} exoloops in the activation of these two homologus receptors...|$|R

25|$|Kinematic {{constraints}} are {{constraints on}} the movement of components of a mechanical system. Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from <b>hinges,</b> sliders and <b>cam</b> joints that define {{the construction of the}} system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following are some common examples.|$|R
40|$|The correct {{functioning}} of Crassulacean acid metabolism (<b>CAM)</b> <b>hinges</b> on effective temporal coordination of the metabolic processes that determine the {{supply and demand}} for carbon over the day/night CAM cycle. In general, light is considered a crucial input factor in sustaining the circadian rhythms of CO 2 uptake and release in CAM plants, probably by triggering different light sensitive sensors such as the red/far red absorbing phytochromes and the blue/UV-A absorbing cryptochromes. Moreover, light is considered essential for the daytime processing of nocturnally accumulated malic acid, as plants in continuous darkness maintain high levels of malic acid for several days. However, the interplay of the different components of the light spectrum (i. e. different wavelengths of light) with the key components of CAM, i. e. stomatal aperture, gas exchange, malic acid processing and carbohydrate partitioning is largely unknown. A 24 h experiment was conducted with the CAM plant Aechmea ‘Maya’ under an 18 h photoperiod but with 4 different wavelengths illuminated by LED, i. e. 470 (blue), 530 (green), 630 (orange - red) and 660 (red) nm administered at 10 µmol m- 2 s- 1. Control treatments consisted of an 18 h photoperiod under white light (100 µmol m- 2 s- 1) and continuous dark for 24 h. For each regime, gas exchange was monitored by IRGA and leaf samples were taken every 4 hours for the determination of organic acids, sugars and starch. The data was complemented with activity measurements in vitro of the key CAM enzymes PEPC and PEPCK, along with measurements of protein and transcript abundance of both enzymes over the diel cycle. By integrating measurements of the key components of CAM at the molecular, biochemical and physiological levels, a picture emerges of the complex interplay between light quality and the {{functioning of}} this photosynthetic specialization. status: publishe...|$|R
