The electrode was positioned in a flow channel (channel electrode) which ensures controllable and defined convection conditions in the electrode surrounding.

Furthermore, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>current</b> efficiency increases with increasing surface poisoning during ethanol oxidation. From the experimental results it can be estimated that the intrinsic current efficiency for the pathway to acetaldehyde is at least 73 (3) %.

40|$|Data from 38 Argo {{profiling}} floats {{are used}} to describe the <b>intermediate</b> Mediterranean <b>currents</b> for the period October 2003 –January 2010. These floats were programmed to execute 5 -day cycles, to drift at a neutral parking depth of 350 m and measure temperature and salinity profiles from either 700 or 2000 m up to the surface. At the end of each cycle the floats remained at the sea surface for about 6 h, enough time to be localised and transmit the data to the Argos satellite system. The Argos positions were used to determine the float surface and intermediate displacements. At the surface, the float motion was approximated by a linear displacement and inertial motion. Intermediate velocities estimates were used to investigate the Mediterranean circulation at 350 m, to compute the pseudo-Eulerian statistics and to study the influence of bathymetry on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>currents.</b> Maximum speeds, as large as 33 cm/s, were found northeast of the Balearic Islands (western basin) and in the Ierapetra eddy (eastern basin). Typical speeds in the main along-slope currents (Liguro-Provençal-Catalan, Algerian and Libyo-Egyptian Currents) were ~ 20 cm/s. In the central and western part of Mediterranean basin, the pseudo-Eulerian statistics show typical intermediate circulation pathways which can be related to the motion of Levantine Intermediate Water. In general our results agree with the qualitative intermediate circulation schemes proposed in the literature, except in the southern Ionian where we found westward-flowing <b>intermediate</b> <b>currents.</b> Fluctuating currents appeared to be usually larger than the mean flow. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>currents</b> were found to be essentially parallel to the isobaths over most of the areas characterized by strong bathymetry gradients, in particular, {{in the vicinity of the}} continental slopes...|$|R

Direct ocean current measurements from lowered‐ADCP are used to describe the main circulation patterns and to estimate the transports of the major currents within the upper 1100 m of the North Brazil Current (NBC) System. In the surface layer (0 ‐ 400 m), the NBC was found to be an intense boundary current transporting northwestward ‐ 14. 4 ± 0. 3 Sv near 5 °S. This current strengthened to the north by 2. 2 Sv at 1 °S apparently due to contributions of the NBC retroflection and North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). The zonal flow was dominated by a meandering Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) which left the box at the east with 9. 5 ± 0. 4 Sv. In the intermediate layer (400 ‐ 1100 m), the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) flowed northwestward into the box with a transport of ‐ 8. 4 ± 0. 3 Sv.

To document this reversal and assess its origin, an unprecedented collection of ADCP observations of zonal currents (2004 - 06), together with a realistic OGCM simulation of the tropical Pacific, was analyzed.

The peak-to-peak amplitude of the annual cycle of subthermocline zonal currents at 165 degrees E in the model is similar to 30 cm s(- 1) at the depth of the EIC, and similar to 20 cm s(- 1) at the depth of the L-EIC, corresponding to a mass transport change as large as similar to 100 Sv for the annual cycle of near-equatorial zonal transport integrated between 2 degrees S and 2 degrees N and between 410 -and 1340 -m depths.

The paper begins by identifying that single-phase multicell CSIs and flying capacitor voltage source inverters (FCVSIs) form a topological dual pair.

This concept is confirmed by full switched simulations. Next, an analytic model is developed to explore the dynamic response and robustness of the balancing process, using a double Fourier series representation of the converter switching signals to linearise a nonlinear transient circuit model. The model is verified against simulations, and predicts that the resistance of the intermediate inductors can perturb the steady state balancing point. The model further predicts that the resistance of the inductance must be small compared to the load resistance to minimize this effect. Results obtained on a five-level experimental CSI precisely match the theoretical model and hence support these conclusions...|$|R

This reference field is dominated by basinwide alternating zonal jets with a meridional wavelength of about 3 degrees. In regions where the sampling of SADCP data is sufficient, the consistency between the two independent datasets is striking; using the Argo drift reference is crucial to capture the current structures. Two apparently distinct systems of alternating westward and eastward zonal jets are seen in both datasets equatorward of 108 : a series of low-latitude subthermocline currents (LLSCs) below the thermocline, extending from about 200 to 800 m, including the eastward Tsuchiya jets; {{and a series of}} low-latitude <b>intermediate</b> <b>currents</b> (LLICs), extending from about 700 to at least 2000 m.
