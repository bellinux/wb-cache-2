25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E

However, {{there was a big}} change in the way Sunhwa's peers looked at her: due to false rumors, they thought she was a JYP trainee; Sunhwa admitted she became afraid of people because of the jealous stares.

They filmed for over 14 days, during which he fit the crew in one car, found an angle for the 35 mm camera and just waited as the shots were taken one by one. He had to carry a diagram in his pocket for the whole time, which had all the plans for every frame they shot.

They also mounted the camera on a bus and rode around New York capturing the scenes.|$|E

[...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark.

He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses.

A headline in a New Orleans newspaper wryly summarized the event as [...] "Army Football Team Severely Penalized for Illegal Passing." [...] While this was a drastic undertaking, the committee also recommended that the same tests not be given to different groups on different days, which practice offered the cadets a big temptation to cheat. [...] Though this was not a pleasant assignment for Middleton, he had been selected for the task because of his reputation for fairness. [...] Though he had never attended West Point, in 1952 he was asked to serve the academy on its Board of Visitors, a position which he held for one three-year term.|$|E
