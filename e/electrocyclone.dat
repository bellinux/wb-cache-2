40|$|Cyclone Separators and Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) {{are both}} {{effective}} particle separators. The former are more efficient at removing the larger particles, {{while the latter}} more suited to removing the smaller size classes. We explore the performance of an <b>Electrocyclone,</b> constructed by simply retrofitting an electrode coaxially to a small existing Whitby cyclone. Tests were performed with respect to particle size, resitivity, loading and various other operating parameters. Non-electrical separation efficiencies ranged from 71 to 75 % and with the application of additional electrical forces the increase in separation efficiency was between 17 and 21 % at a cyclone Reynolds number of 19000, with the most conductive particle most easily separated. Further parametric testing correlated the effects of dust loading, <b>electrocyclone</b> Reynolds Number and particle cut upon separation efficiency. In particular we show that {{the separation of the}} smallest size cuts (D < 38 m) of the dust sample almost doubled upon application of the corona. We conclude, based on this initial study of small devices, the range of use of cyclones may be extended significantly by the application of additional electrophoretic separation...|$|E
40|$|NASA {{has built}} a {{prototype}} oxygen production plant to process the lunar regolith using the hydrogen reduction chemical process. This plant is known as "ROxygen - making oxygen from moon rocks". The ROxygen regolith transfer team has identified the flow and transfer characteristics of lunar regolith simulant to be a concern for lunar oxygen production efforts. It is important to ISRU lunar exploration efforts to develop hardware designs that can demonstrate the ability to flow and transfer a given mass of regolith simulant to a desired vertical height under lunar gravity conditions in order to introduce it into a reactor. We will present results obtained under both 1 / 6 -g and 1 -g gravity conditions for a system that can pneumatically convey 16. 5 kg of lunar regolith simulant (NU-LHT- 2 M, Mauna Kea Tephra, and JSC- 1 A) from a flat-bottom supply hopper to a simulated ISRU reactor (dual-chambered receiving hopper) where the granular material is separated from the convey gas (air) using a series of cyclone separators, {{one of which is}} an electrically enhanced cyclone separator (<b>electrocyclone).</b> The results of our study include (1) the mass flow rate as a function of input air pressure for lunar regolith simulants that are conveyed pneumatically as a dusty gas in a vertical direction against gravity under lunar gravity conditions (for NU-LHT- 2 M and Mauna Kea Tephra), and under earth gravity conditions (for NU-LHT- 2 M, Mauna Kea Tephra and JSC- 1 A), and (2) the efficiency of the cyclone/electrocyclone filtration system in separating the convey gas (air) from the granular particulates as a function of particle size...|$|E
