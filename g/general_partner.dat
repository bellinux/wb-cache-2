5|$|In 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the {{spin-off}} {{private equity}} investment firm, Bain Capital. He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain's offer to head the new venture, until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure {{so that there was}} no financial or professional risk to Romney. Bain and Romney raised the $37million in funds needed to start the new operation, which had seven employees. Romney held the titles of president and managing <b>general</b> <b>partner.</b> Though he was the sole shareholder of the firm, publications also referred to him as managing director or CEO.|$|E

He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies.

A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a <b>general</b> <b>partner.</b> The <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> may be an individual or a corporation. The <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E
