5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the <b>first</b> <b>season,</b> <b>as</b> he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was a {{standout}} among her peers. In her <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> a soloist at New York City Center, in which avant-garde ballets works were performed, she received good notices in The New York Times for a Balanchine Ballo della Regina role. Also in 2007, she created {{a leading role}} in C. to C. (Close to Chuck), choreographed by Jorma Elo to A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close, Études 2, 9 & 10, by Philip Glass. Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as more sophisticated and contemporary as a soloist than she had been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty were also well received.|$|E
5|$|Derek McInnes was {{announced}} as {{the successor to}} Craig Brown in March 2013. In McInnes' <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> manager, Aberdeen won the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup after defeating Inverness 4–2 on penalties, their first trophy in 19 years. Aberdeen {{finished third in the}} Scottish Premiership, and began the next season by coming through the early rounds of the Europa League, beating Dutch club FC Groningen before eventually being eliminated by Spanish side Real Sociedad. The club ended the season in second place in both 2015 and 2016, their best league position since 1993–94. In recent seasons' Europa League competitions, they were defeated in the third qualifying round three times: In 2015–16 by FC Kairat, in 2016–17 by NK Maribor, and in 2017–18 by Apollon Limassol.|$|E

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, the Thrashers {{franchise}} {{was bought}} and relocated by True North Sports and Entertainment, becoming the Winnipeg Jets. Kane was enjoying a successful <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> a Jet, leading his team in scoring with 18 goals and 31 points by mid-January 2012. During that month, however, he was sidelined with a concussion that was reported on January 21. Later in the season, he recorded a four-point game (two goals and two assists) in a 7–0 win against the Florida Panthers on March 1, 2012. On September 15, 2012, Kane signed a six-year, $31.5 million contract extension with the Jets.|$|E

5|$|For three seasons, City {{finished}} in mid-table in Division Three {{and the new}} Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following {{the formation of the}} Premier League. In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond took over as chairman. He cleared the debts, loaned the club £2.3million, and promised the fans he would take the club to the Premier League within five years. In his <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> chairman, the club {{finished in}} seventh place with Frank Stapleton as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence could only finish 14th in his first season, before he left for Luton Town in November 1995 to be replaced by his assistant Chris Kamara.|$|E
5|$|He {{promptly}} {{became the}} Yankees' best pitcher, recording the highest winning percentage in the AL in his <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> a Yankee. In 1949, joined by Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat, {{he was a}} star of a Yankee team that won the first of five consecutive league championships, a feat {{that had never been}} achieved before. He played many important roles for those teams. In his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 wins, and 14 complete games. As a swingman, he averaged 26 games started and 9 games finished per season.|$|E
5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making any impact {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for the future.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the team's <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> a Pirates affiliate, the Sounds {{finished}} {{last in the}} American Conference East Division with a 67–76 record. The Sounds {{were led}} by manager Trent Jewett who {{would go on to}} win 320games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Sounds managers. The Sounds experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, putting together an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish left them out of the PCL playoffs where only division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E

Al-Talaba {{finished}} in 3rd place in the table at 15 points. The season after, in 1979–80, Al-Talaba finished in 3rd place at 27 points {{in the league and}} reached the final of the 1979–80 Iraq FA Cup where they came up against Al-Jaish and lost on penalties 4–2 after a 1–1 draw.|$|E
5|$|Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson {{was then}} hired, but he {{proved to be}} unpopular with Hibs supporters. However, a string of {{exciting}} young players emerged, including Garry O'Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2–0 to Livingston. Williamson departed {{near the end of}} that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. Mowbray promised fast-flowing, passing football, with which Hibs finished third in his <b>first</b> <b>season</b> <b>as</b> manager, while Mowbray won the SFWA Manager of the Year award.|$|E

The following season, the club was involved in one of the worst football stadium disasters. Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final versus Juventus, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, caused a five year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{was always}} noted for his {{dedication}} to football and, in his playing days, would do his own training {{during the summer}} months.

He was an early exponent of the long throw-in and, according to the site, he practiced by throwing balls over a row of houses and the small boys of the village helped by fetching them back for him.|$|E
