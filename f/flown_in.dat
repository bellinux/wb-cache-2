5|$|Another form of airpower {{employed}} by Kenney was air transport. This started in September 1942 when {{troops of the}} 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby. Later in the campaign, C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela. A year later, American paratroops landed at Nadzab, enabling the Australian 7th Division to be <b>flown</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an {{astronaut}} into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met. By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.|$|E
5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no human being had yet <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> space. In fact, the task before him was vast, {{requiring}} attention to flight plans, timelines, procedures, mission rules, spacecraft tracking, telemetry, ground support, telecommunications networks and contingency management.|$|E

5|$|The MiG-9 was <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> Soviet {{service by}} fighter regiments in the 1st, 7th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Air Armies.

50|$|With {{the larger}} number of seats {{available}} on the Space Shuttle, the U.S. began taking international astronauts.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 18/19 October, the Japanese cut the route that the Australians were using to supply the 2/17th {{defending}} Jivevaneng and established a road block astride the Jivevaneng–Sattelberg road. The 2/17th {{and a number of}} other Australian units, such as most of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, as well as part of the 2/28th, became isolated behind Japanese lines. In order to keep them supplied, emergency air drops of ammunition were <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E

Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|If the {{flagpoles}} {{have not}} the same height, the flag must be <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> the highest pole.

5|$|On July 2, 2005, Fossett and {{co-pilot}} Mark Rebholz recreated {{the first}} nonstop {{crossing of the}} Atlantic which {{was made by the}} British team of John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June 1919 in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Their flight from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada to Clifden, County Galway, Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th fairway of the Connemara Golf Links.|$|E

5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta {{still had}} three test assemblies, F101, F102 and F103, but the damaged F32 was unserviceable, so new {{explosive}} blocks {{would have to}} be <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> from Project Camel. There were also shortages of some components, notably detonator chimneys. These were fabricated on Tinian. Seven B-29s of the 509th Composite Group flew Pumpkin bomb missions on 14 August.

5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> {{to the upper}} Markham Valley. It {{accomplished}} the 7th Division's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the entire Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war against the Japanese.|$|E
