5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department {{introduced him to the}} craft and textiles courses in the College of <b>Home</b> <b>economics,</b> and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in <b>home</b> <b>economics.</b> As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog. Henson would remain at WRC for seven years, from 1954 to 1961.|$|E

Chitwood, the chairman of the House Education Committee, who became the first Texas Tech business manager, spoke at the event. Chitwood served in the position only fifteen months; he died in November 1926. With an enrollment of 914 students—both men and women—Texas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925. It was originally composed of four schools—Agriculture, Engineering, <b>Home</b> <b>Economics,</b> and Liberal Arts.|$|E

5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the Department of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> {{was moved}} under the College of Agriculture, {{and all of}} the faculty members became {{affiliated}} with the California Agricultural Experiment Station. Late in her career, she was involved in an Agricultural Experiment Station project that examined nutrition among older people in San Mateo County. That work yielded two important conclusions: that bone density began to decline in {{women between the ages of}} 50 and 65, and that dietary fat intake led to increases in serum cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936– May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, and filmmaker who {{achieved}} international fame as {{the creator}} of the Muppets. Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Leland, Mississippi, and Hyattsville, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. While he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, he created Sam and Friends, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in <b>home</b> <b>economics,</b> he produced coffee advertisements and developed some experimental films. Henson founded Muppets Inc. in 1958 (which would later become the Jim Henson Company).|$|E

40|$|Hospitals are an {{important}} component of the healthcare delivery system. Over the years, India has experienced a significant increase in the number iof hospital beds to meet the growing health demands of its poopulalation. Most of this growth has been experienced in the small sized private hospital sector (popularly known as nursing homes in India). The corporate hospital sector, however has not exhibited similar growth though private expenditures on medical and health care in real terms have grown at 10 per cent per annum. This experience has something to do with the financial health and risks, as these are critical determinants in attracting private capital. Using the financial balance sheets and profit and loss accounts data of 128 hsopitals in India, this paper examines the financial health of hsopitals in the private sector. Based on 26 key financial ratios, the paper empirically identifies relevant dimensions of financial health of hospitals. private hospitals, corporate hospital sector, private expenditure on health, small hospitals, nursing <b>homes,</b> <b>Economics,</b> Health Economics, Health Studies...|$|R

5|$|Martha {{attended}} Shelbyville High School {{where she}} was a good student and a cheerleader. She frequently competed in beauty pageants and won the title of Shelby County Tobacco Festival Queen in 1954. After high school, Hall enrolled at Lindenwood College, then an all-woman college in Saint Charles, Missouri (It is now a co-ed university). After one year at Lindenwood, she transferred to the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky. She was active in many clubs, including the Chi Omega social sorority, the Baptist Student Union, and the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> club, and was also the president of her dormitory {{and vice president of the}} house presidents council.|$|E
5|$|Though she officially {{retired in}} 1954, Morgan {{continued}} {{to come to}} the office for nearly the rest of her life. Just after Morgan's retirement, the University of California System decided to offer <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> only at the Davis and Santa Barbara campuses, and the nutrition program was continued at Berkeley. Forty of her papers were published after her retirement date. After suffering a heart attack in early July 1968, Morgan died on July 20. At the time of her death, she still headed the selection committee for new fellows of the American Institute of Nutrition.|$|E

They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley. Janet never finished her degree, a fact she regretted later in life.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Hall met Billy Louis Collins while {{attending}} a Baptist camp in Shelby County.

Instead, she and Collins married shortly after her graduation. While Billy Collins pursued a degree in dentistry at the University of Louisville, Martha taught at Seneca and Fairdale high schools, both located in Louisville.

50|$|Home equity is {{the market}} value of a homeowner's {{unencumbered}} interest in their real property - that is, the difference of the home's fair market value and the outstanding balance of all liens on the property.

In <b>economics,</b> <b>home</b> equity is sometimes called real property value.|$|R
5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program.|$|E
