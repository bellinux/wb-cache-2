Runs of four days were of sufficient length to coarsen these intergrowths such that individual euhedral crystals could be observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Staged {{construction}} and ground improvements are two strategies adopted in designing high embankments at sites underlain by soft and sensitive foundation soils. Usually the gain in shear strengths are estimated from poorly documented local experience database and an elaborate scheme of construction monitoring is implemented {{to ensure the}} pace of construction {{does not lead to}} remolding and progressive failure. A procedure has been developed in this study for estimation of undrained shear strength as a function of embankment height and rate of construction. The procedure has been calibrated using two embankment failure case histories in eastern India reported by Roy and Singh [1] and the monitoring data obtained during the reconstruction activities of one of these embankments. The proposed procedure was then utilized in predicting the embankment response at two soft soil sites (Chung et al. [2]).

40|$|Via joint {{analysis}} of a calibrated telescopic survey, which found scattering Kuiper Belt objects, and models of their expected orbital distribution, we measure {{the form of the}} scattering object's size distribution. Ruling out a single power-law at greater than 99 % confidence, we constrain the form of the size distribution and find that, surprisingly, our analysis favours a very sudden decrease (a divot) in the number distribution as diameters decrease below 100 km, with the number of smaller objects then rising again as expected via collisional equilibrium. Extrapolating at this collisional <b>equilibrium</b> <b>slope</b> produced enough kilometer-scale scattering objects to supply the nearby Jupiter-Family comets. Our interpretation is that this divot feature is a preserved relic of the size distribution made by planetesimal formation, now "frozen in" to portions of the Kuiper Belt sharing a "hot" orbital inclination distribution, explaining several puzzles in Kuiper Belt science. Additionally, we show that to match today's scattering-object inclination distribution, the supply source that was scattered outward must have already been vertically heated to of order 10 degrees.

40|$|The {{application}} of geomorphic principles to land reclamation after surface mining {{has been reported}} in the literature since the mid- 1990 s, mostly from Australia, Canada and the USA. This paper discusses the reclamation problems of contour mining and quarries on slopes, where steep gradients are prone to both mass movement and water erosion. To address these problems simultaneously, a geomorphic model for reclaiming surface mined slopes is described. Called the ‘highwall–trench– concave slope’ model, it was fi rst applied in the 1995 reclamation of a quarry on a slope (La Revilla) in Central Spain. The geomorphic model does not reproduce the original topography, but has two very different sectors and objectives: (i) the highwall–trench sector allows the former quarry face to evolve naturally by erosion, accommodating fallen debris by means of a trench constructed at the toe of the highwall; (ii) the concave-slope base sector, mimicking the landforms of the surrounding undisturbed landscape, promotes soil formation and the establishment of self-sustaining, functional ecosystems in the area protected from sedimentation by the trench. The model improves upon simple topographic reconstruction, because it rebuilds the surfi cial geology architecture and facilitates re-establishment of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>slopes</b> through the management and control of geomorphic processes. Thirteen years of monitoring of the geomorphic and edaphic evolution of La Revilla reclaimed quarry confi rms that the area is functioning as intended: the highwall is backwasting and material is accumulating at the trench, permitting the recovery of soils and vegetation on the concave slope. However, the trench is fi lling faster than planned, which may lead to run-off and sedimentation on the concave slope once the trench is full. The lesson learned for other scenarios is that the model works well in a twodimensional scheme, but requires a three-dimensional drainage management, breaking the reclaimed area into several watersheds with stream channels...|$|R

40|$|The Valles Marineris canyon {{system in}} Mars shows large {{landslides}} across its walls, {{which can be}} 40 km wide and up to 60 km long, with fall scarps height as high as 7 km. These landslides were produced through a large mass movement at high speed by gravity across the trough floor.

The diabatic circulation iself is, however, driven primarily by eddy transports, which maintain the departure of stratospheric temperatures from radiative equilibrium. If the eddy transports are weak, the diabatic circulation is also weak and the slope is small.

40|$|Crater count {{equilibrium}} {{occurs when}} new craters form {{at the same}} rate that old craters are erased, such that the total number of observable impacts remains constant. Despite substantial efforts to understand this process, there remain many unsolved problems. Here, we propose an analytical model that describes how a heavily cratered surface reaches a state of crater count equilibrium. The proposed model formulates three physical processes contributing to crater count equilibrium: cookie-cutting (simple, geometric overlap), ejecta-blanketing, and sandblasting (diffusive erosion). These three processes are modeled using a degradation parameter that describes the efficiency for a new crater to erase old craters. The flexibility of our newly developed model allows us to represent the processes that underlie crater count equilibrium problems. The results show that when the slope of the production function is steeper than that of the equilibrium state, the power law of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>slope</b> is independent of that of the production function slope. We apply our model to the cratering conditions in the Sinus Medii region and at the Apollo 15 landing site on the Moon and demonstrate that a consistent degradation parameterization can successfully be determined based on the empirical results of these regions.

We develop a sketch model of the HDs in {{the inner and outer}} parts of the disk that is consistent with the observed distributions and with the dynamical evolution scenario known as the ‘Nice model'. This leads us to predict that the HD of hot population should have the same slope of the HD of the cold population for, both as steep as the slope of the Trojans' HD. Current data partially support this prediction, but future observations are needed to clarify this issue. Because the HD of the Trojans rolls over at to a collisional <b>equilibrium</b> <b>slope</b> that should have been acquired when the Trojans were still embedded in the primordial trans-Neptunian disk, our model implies that the same roll-over should characterize the HDs of the Kuiper belt populations, in agreement with the results of Bernstein et al.

These failures {{can be defined as}} complex earth slides- earth flows. One of the documented landslides has been investigated by modelling the ground water infiltration process, the positive and negative pore water pressure variations and the effects of these variations on slope stability during the rainfall event. Morphometric and geotechnical analyses were carried out through a series of in-situ and laboratory tests, the results of which were used as input for the modelling process. The surface infiltration rate was initially simulated using the rainfall recorded at the nearest raingauge station. Finite element seepage analysis for transient conditions were then employed to model the changes in pore water pressure during the storm event, using the computed infiltration rate as the ground surface boundary condition. Finally, the limit <b>equilibrium</b> <b>slope</b> stability method was applied to calculate the variations in the factor of safety during the event and thereby determine the critical time of instability. For the investigated site the trend of the factor of safety indicates that the critical time for failure occurs about 18 h after the storm commences, and highlights the key role played by the soil permeability and thickness in controlling the response in terms of slope instability...|$|E
