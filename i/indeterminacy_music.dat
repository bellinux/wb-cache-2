50|$|Bradshaw is {{responsible}} for bringing the idea of <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music</b> to the visual art world. Taking inspiration {{from the work of}} composer John Cage, Bradshaw allows natural forces to act upon her works to bring them to completion. Her first work in this regard was a 1969 installation entitled Plain Air,” in which a pair of mourning doves were introduced to hanging bicycle wheels and floor mounted targets.|$|R
50|$|As a music {{composer}} and radio artist, Létourneau's works {{are influenced by}} the principle of <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music,</b> chance music, intuitive music, noise music, sound poetry, text-sound composition, spectral music, non-standard use of musical instruments, traditional music from different cultures (especially Balinese gamelan), by the use of different systems of tuning involving the use of microtones which incorporate electronics and extended techniques. He also regularly constructs his own instruments and custom-built electronics.|$|R

In her solo work, she usually produces dense and brooding soundscapes from {{a collection of}} recordings and live actions. Famous {{for the use of}} her custom-made musical instruments and for the non-standard use of musical instruments, Babins music works are based on <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music,</b> tape music and improvisation. She is also part of the music performance trio mineminemine along with André Éric Létourneau and Alexandre Saint-Onge.|$|R

This series of nine episodes explores generative approaches (including algorithmic, systems-based, formalised and procedural) to composition and performance primarily in the context of experimental technologies and music practices of {{the latter part of the}} twentieth century and examines the use of determinacy and <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music</b> and how these relate to issues around control, automation and artistic intention.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of Complexity Theory as an inspiration {{for the creation of}} new musical works, and highlights problems and possible solutions associated with its application as a compositional tool. In particular it explores how the philosophy behind Complexity Theory affects notions of process-based composition, <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music</b> and the performer/listener/environment relationship, culminating in providing a basis for the understanding of music creation as an active process within a context. The author presents one of his own sound installations, Cross-Pollination, {{as an example of a}} composition inspired and best understood from the philosophical position as described in Complexity Theory...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} significant use of <b>music</b> <b>indeterminacy</b> features {{is found}} {{in many of the}} compositions of American composer Charles Ives in the early 20th century. Henry Cowell adopted Ives's ideas during the 1930s, in such works as the Mosaic Quartet (String Quartet No. 3, 1934), which allows the players to arrange the fragments of music {{in a number of different}} possible sequences. Cowell also used specially devised notations to introduce variability into the performance of a work, sometimes instructing the performers to improvise a short passage or play ad libitum. John Cage is regarded as a pioneer of <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music.</b> Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the so-called New York School: Earle Brown, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff. Others working in this way included the Scratch Orchestra in the United Kingdom (1968 until the early 1970s) and the Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi (born 1933). In Europe, following the introduction of the expression [...] "aleatory music" [...] by Werner Meyer-Eppler, the French composer Pierre Boulez was largely responsible for popularizing the term [...]|$|R
50|$|Stylistically Heinrich's {{music has}} {{more in common}} with other early American music than with the models of his European contemporaries. He shunned development, preferring episodic forms, {{especially}} the theme with variations, which he used to impressive expressive effect. He occasionally wrote passages of startling, even jarring, chromaticism, usually in an attempt to express an extra-musical idea. Often his music has an improvisatory quality (much of his music may be notated improvisation, considering its copious quantity). His generous allowances for performer interpretation are arguably the beginning of <b>indeterminacy</b> in American <b>music.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{found objects}} in modern {{classical}} music is often connected to experiments in <b>indeterminacy</b> and aleatory <b>music</b> by such composers as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, {{although it has}} reached its ascendancy in those areas of popular music as well, such as the ambient works of Brian Eno. In Eno's influential work, found objects are credited on many tracks. [...] The ambient music movement which followed Eno's lead has also made use of such sounds, with notable exponents being performers such as Future Sound of London and Autechre, and natural sounds have also been incorporated into many pieces of new-age music.|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{traced the}} {{development}} of the various style trends in the music of john Cage through the study of actual music, literary description in the form of reviews and the writings of Cage, and other secondary sources. The time period covered is approximately 1933 to 1969, divided into two "periods. " It was shown that the music of the first period, 1935 to 1951, contained several common attributes including interest provided by rhythmic complexity, expansion of the timbral repertoire, and form according to rhythmic structure. These attributes continued or evolved into new concepts after {{the development of}} chance in 1952, and the music of the first and second parts of the second period show a gradual move from chance to total <b>indeterminacy</b> in <b>music.</b> Causes and influences affecting Cage's development of the various style-trends are discussed {{in the context of the}} musical descriptions and are also referred to in more detail in an opening biographical chapter dealing with the events of Cage's life.

40|$|Music and {{dynamical}} systems share {{aspects of}} patterning, repetition, and variation over time, but most music that references dynamical systems as a compositional influence are mimetic {{representations of the}} system, the music is a static ’snapshot’ of the system. I propose an approach where the compositional and performative processes are analogous to the dynamical system, and the music develops in realtime through performance, acting {{as a model of}} the system in musical form. The dynamical system process is translated from the mathematical to the musical/performative, retaining its mechanisms but in a new medium. This paper will explore two examples of previous mimetic approaches, and a brief exposition on similarities between dynamical systems and musical <b>indeterminacy</b> (in experimental <b>music).</b> I will then present examples from my work There are Neither Wholes Nor Parts (2011), showing how feedback and hysteresis are used to create musical processes that affords non-linear and emergent sound structures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the human {{capacity}} for musicality is integral to the human capacity for culture, and that the key feature of music that motivates its efficacy is its indeterminacy of meaning, or floating intentionality. It suggests that, from an evolutionary perspective, a focus on music's commonalities of function (rather than of structure) across cultures provides an appropriate framework for theorising the roles and the operational features of <b>music's</b> <b>indeterminacy</b> of meaning. A three-dimension account of meaning in music is presented in which biologically generic, humanly specific, and culturally enactive dimensions {{of the experience of}} music are delineated, with summary examples of the application of the theory to musical usages in different cultures. It is noted that the dimensions outlined in the theory may be operational at different semiotic levels, and it is concluded that music became part of the repertoire of modern human behaviour as an exaptive consequence of processes of progressive altricialisation in the hominin lineage. ...|$|R
