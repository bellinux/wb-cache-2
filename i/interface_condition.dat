For numerical calculations, the space where the calculation of the electromagnetic field is achieved must be restricted to some boundaries. This is done by assuming conditions at the boundaries, that do not disturb the electromagnetic field, and allows not to calculate the field outside.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{processes of}} the dissolved chemicals in stratified or layered soils have been studied for several decades. In case of the solute transport through stratified layers, <b>interface</b> <b>condition</b> {{plays an important role}} in determining appropriate transport parameters. First‐ type and third‐ type interface conditions are generally used in the literature.

30|$|Coupling two {{separate}} models via an interface generally needs some appropriate and effective interface conditions. For Stokes–Darcy model, the coupling conditions are well studied and usually modeled by three interface conditions. The first two consist of {{the continuity of}} the normal velocity across the interface, which is a consequence of the conservation of mass, and the balance of normal force across the interface. The third <b>interface</b> <b>condition</b> is a benchmark boundary condition invented by Beavers–Joseph in 1967 by conducting several experiments [6]. In the Beavers–Joseph <b>interface</b> <b>condition,</b> the tangential component of the stress force of the flow in the free medium at the interface is proportional to the jump of the tangential velocity across the interface.
