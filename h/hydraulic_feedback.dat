40|$|In a {{recultivation}} area {{located in}} Brandenburg, Germany, five types of biocrusts (initial BSC 1, developed BSC 2 and BSC 3, mosses, lichens) and non-crusted mineral substrate were sampled on tertiary sand deposited in 1985 - 1986 to investigate hydrologic interactions between crust patches. Crust biomass was {{lowest in the}} non-crusted substrate, increased to the initial BSC 1 and peaked in the developed BSC 2, BSC 3, the lichens and the mosses. Water infiltration was highest on the substrate, and decreased to BSC 2, BSC 1 and BSC 3. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the lichens and BSC 3 were associated with water soluble nutrients and with pyrite weathering products, thus representing a high nutrient low <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> mode. The mosses and BSC 2 represented a low nutrient high <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> mode. These feedback mechanisms were considered as synergic, consisting of run-off generating (low hydraulic) and run-on receiving (high hydraulic) BSC patches. Three scenarios for BSC succession were proposed. (1) Initial BSCs sealed the surface until they reached a successional stage (represented by BSC 1) from which the development into either of the feedback modes was triggered, (2) initial heterogeneities of the mineral substrate controlled {{the development of the}} feedback mode, and (3) complex interactions between lichens and mosses occurred at later stages of system development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a model of the Medical Isotope Production Reactor (MIPR) : a conceptual Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor (AHR). The model is a point kinetics model with zero and one-dimensional thermal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> Three versions of the model of increasing complexity are presented and a number of scenarios are modelled with each version. The results of these simulations shows the stability of the reactor against reactivity insertions caused by the strong negative reactivity feedbacks inherent to AHRs. The first version of the model is modified using intrusive polynomial chaos in order to simulate the effects of uncertainty in key parameters. This allows a novel study into which physical parameters and processes are important at each stage of a transient and in determining steady state conditions. The final version of the model is used to model the CRAC- 43 experiment and, after modification to include the delay of radiolytic gas production which accompanies the start up of an AHR, good agreement was found between model and experiment. The development of the equations, correlations and parameters used in the model is approached {{from the point of view}} of the governing physics. This approach to model development enables a comprehensive exploration of the physical processes underpinning the behaviour of AHRs. As well as being one of the most complete and fundamentally based models of an AHR presented within the literature, the final model is also extremely versatile and general. Given the appropriate input neutronic and thermal-hydraulic data the model presented in this thesis should be able to simulate a very wide range of AHR behaviour. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of system stability {{within the context}} of reactor design is addressed for the case of a reduced sodium void worth, metal fueled, liquid metal cooled, fast reactor with a single feedback path associated with the reactor outlet coolant temperature under low reactor power, low reactor coolant flow conditions such as might be found after a loss of flow without scram in some passively safe reactor designs. Stability characterization is performed as system parameters, such as temperature coefficient of reactivity, reactor coolant flow, and natural circulation flow, vary. The system model represents the reactor, the detailed thermal <b>hydraulic</b> reactivity <b>feedback</b> path associated with reactor outlet temperature, and decay heat. The computational procedure consists of a main numeric task which takes input functions generated by auxiliary symbolic preprocessing. In the symbolic stage, transcendental transfer functions are rationalized and introduced in a complex-variable root-locus [...] ...|$|R
40|$|High {{precision}} and fast response are of great significance for hydraulic pressure control in automotive braking systems. In this paper, a novel {{sliding mode control}} based high-precision <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>feedback</b> modulation is proposed. Dynamical models of the hydraulic brake system including valve dynamics are established. An open loop load pressure control based on the linear relationship between the pressure-drop and coil current in valve critical open equilibrium state is proposed, and also experimentally validated on a hardware-in-the-loop test rig. The control characteristics under different input pressures and varied coil currents are investigated. Moreover, {{the sensitivity of the}} proposed modulation on valve's key structure parameters and environmental temperatures are explored with some unexpected drawbacks. In order to achieve better robustness and precision, a sliding mode control based closed loop scheme is developed for the linear pressure-drop modulation. Comparative tests between this method and the existing methods are carried out. The results validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed closed loop modulation method...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the mechanistic basis of stomatal control is necessary to understand why modes of stomatal response differ among individual trees, and to improve the theoretical foundation for predictive models and manipulative experiments. Current understanding of the mechanistic basis of stomatal control is reviewed here and discussed in relation to the plant hydraulic system. Analysis focused on: (1) the relative role of hydraulic conductance {{in the vicinity of the}} stomatal apparatus versus whole-plant hydraulic conductance; (2) the influence of guard cell inflation characteristics and the mechanical interaction between guard cells and epidermal cells; and (3) the system requirements for moderate versus dramatic reductions in stomatal conductance with increasing evaporation potential. Special consideration was given to the potential effect of changes in hydraulic properties as trees grow taller. Stomatal control of leaf gas exchange is coupled to the entire plant hydraulic system and the basis of this coupling is the interdependence of guard cell water potential and transpiration rate. This <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> loop is always present, but its dynamic properties may be altered by growth or cavitation-induced changes in hydraulic conductance, and may vary with genetically related differences in hydraulic conductances. Mechanistic models should include this feedback loop. Plants vary in their ability to control transpiration rate sufficiently to maintain constant leaf water potential. Limited control may be achieved through the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> loop alone, but for tighter control, an additional element linking transpiration rate to guard cell osmotic pressure may be needed...|$|E
30|$|The {{porosity}} and permeability of Tennenbach and Pfinztal Sandstone {{have been}} quantified in advance by thin section and permeability tests. REDBACK allows the coupling of mechanical deformation with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback.</b> Thus, {{it is possible}} to quantify the porosity and permeability changes due to compressive loading and volumetric changes using Eqs.  9 – 11. The results are shown in Figs.  8 and 9. Porosity is decreasing from initially 8 % to 6.6 % (PfSst) and from 9 % to 7.8 % (TenSst), corresponding to a total reduction of 17.5 % and 13.3 %, respectively. The permeability decreases from 3.0  *  10 − 17 to 1.6  *  10 − 17 m 2 (PfSst) and from 4.0  *  10 − 17 to 2.6  *  10 − 17 m 2 (TenSst), which is a drop of 46.6 % and 35 %, respectively.|$|E
40|$|A {{facility}} {{for the study}} of dynamic stall of an airfoil undergoing a transient ramp-type pitching motion is described. The facility can produce pitch rates of 3600 deg/sec to an angle of attack of 60 deg by using a specially designed <b>hydraulic</b> drive with <b>feedback</b> control. The ramp motion generator can also generate arbitrary motion of the airfoil and thus can simulate an arbitrary aircraft maneuver. A unique airfoil support system allows unobstructed flow visualization including the complete airfoil contour, thus permitting the use of nonintrusive optical diagnostic methods for flow measurement close to the surface as well as simultaneous far-field measurements. Schlieren pictures obtained during the study reveal the instantaneous density gradients associated with dynamic stall, even under conditions of very low Mach numbers...|$|R
40|$|Human operated, {{hydraulic}} actuated machines {{are widely used}} in many high-power applications. Improving productivity, safety and task quality (e. g., haptic feedback in a teleoperated scenario) {{has been the focus}} of past research. For robotic systems that interact with the physical environments, passivity is a useful property for ensuring safety and interaction stability. While passivity is a well utilized concept in electromechanical robotic systems, investigation of electrohydraulic control systems that enforce this passivity property are rare. This paper proposes and experimentally demonstrates a teleoperation control algorithm that renders a <b>hydraulic</b> backhoe/force <b>feedback</b> joystick system as a two-port, coordinated, passive machine. By fully accounting for the fluid compressibility, inertia dynamics and nonlinearity, coordination performance is much improved over a previous scheme in which the coordination control approximates the hydraulic system by its kinematic behavior. This is accomplished by a novel bond graph based three step design methodology: (1) energetically invariant transformation of the system into a pair of “shape” and “locked” subsystems; (2) inversion of the shape system bond graph to derive the coordination control law; (3) use of the locked system bond graph to derive an appropriate control law to achieve a target locked system dynamics while ensuring the passivity property of the coordinated system. The proposed passive control law has been experimentally verified for its bilateral energy transfer ability and performance enhancements...|$|R
40|$|The {{current state}} of the art in reactor physics methods to assess safety, fuel failure, and {{operability}} margins for Design Basis Accidents (DBAs) for Light Water Reactors (LWRs) rely upon the coupling of nodal neutronics and one-dimensional thermal hydraulic system codes. The neutronic calculations use a multi-step approach in which the assembly homogenized macroscopic cross sections and kinetic parameters are first calculated using a lattice code for the range of conditions (temperatures, burnup, control rod position, etc [...] .) anticipated during the transient. The core calculation is then performed using the few group cross sections in a core simulator which uses some type of coarse mesh nodal method. The multi-step approach was identified as inadequate for several applications such as the design of MOX cores and other highly hetereogeneous, high leakage core designs. Because of the considerable advances in computing power over the last several years, there has been interest in high-fidelity solutions of the Boltzmann Transport equation. A practical approach developed for high-fidelity solutions of the 3 D transport equation is the 2 D- 1 D methodology in which the method of characteristics (MOC) is applied to the heterogeneous 2 D planar problem and a lower order solution is applied to the axial problem which is, generally, more uniform. This approach was implemented in the DeCART code. Recently, there has been interest in extending such approach to the simulations of design basis accidents, such as control rod ejection accidents also known as reactivity initiated accidents (RIA). The current 2 D- 1 D algorithm available in DeCART only provide 1 D axial solution based on the diffusion theory whose accuracy deteriorates in case of strong flux gradient that can potentially be observed during RIA simulations. The primary ojective of the dissertation is to improve the accuracy and range of applicability of the DeCART code and to investigate its ability to perform a full core transient analysis of a realistic RIA. The specific research accomplishments of this work include:*	The addition of more accurate 2 D- 1 D coupling and transverse leakage splitting options to avoid the occurrence of negative source terms in the 2 D MOC equations and the subsequent failure of the DeCART calculation and the improvement of the convergence of the 2 D- 1 D method. *	The implementation of a higher order transport axial solver based on NEM-Sn derivation of the Boltzmann equation. *	Improved handling of thermal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedbacks</b> by DeCART during transient calculations. *	A consistent comparison of the DeCART transient methodology with the current multistep approach (PARCS) for a realistic full core RIA. An efficient direct whole core transport calculation method involving the NEM-Sn formulation for the axial solution and the MOC for the 2 -D radial solution was developed. In this solution method, the Sn neutron transport equations were developed {{within the framework of the}} Nodal Expansion Method. A RIA analysis was performed and the DeCART results were compared to the current generation of LWR core analysis methods represented by the PARCS code. In general there is good overall agreement in terms of global information from DeCART and PARCS for the RIA considered. However, the higher fidelity solution in DeCART provides a better spatial resolution that is expected to improve the accuracy of fuel performance calculations and to enable reducing the margin in several important reactor safety analysis events such as the RIA...|$|R

The development of a four-point bending test arrangement to determine the dynamic mechanical properties of rectangular beam specimens (305 × 45 × 50 mm dimensions) of bituminous mixtures is discussed. This novel system allows the crack-damaged surfaces of beam specimens to be inspected and monitored digitally in situ during fatigue tests. The test fixture, which was integrated with a closed-loop servo <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> system, incorporates a constant clamping mechanism and uses a combined displacement and loading mode of control.

40|$|Nitrogen limits leaf gas exchange, canopy development, and {{evapotranspiration}} in many ecosystems. In dryland ecosystems, it {{is unclear}} whether increased anthropogenic nitrogen inputs alter the widely recognized dominance of water and energy constraints on ecohydrology. We use observations from a factorial irrigation and fertilization experiment in a nitrogen-limited southern California annual grassland to explore this hypothesis. Our analysis shows growing season soil moisture and canopy-scale water vapor conductance are equivalent in control and fertilized plots. This consistency arises as fertilization-induced increases in leaf area index (LAI) are offset by reduced leaf area-based stomatal conductance, g[subscript s]. We interpret this as evidence of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> between LAI, plant water status, and g[subscript s], not commonly implemented in evapotranspiration models. These results support the notion that canopy physiology and structure are coordinated in water-limited ecosystems to maintain a transpiration flux tightly controlled by hydraulic constraints in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere pathway.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{advances}} in discrete element modeling now allow the direct simulation of river ice dynamics. By resolving the contact and body forces acting {{on thousands of}} individual floes at each time step, the initiation, grounding, and formation of river ice jams can be simulated and studied. The concomitant water flow can be modeled using a coupled unsteady <b>hydraulic</b> model, with <b>feedback</b> provided between floes and water by water drag and blockage of the channel flow area by ice. Four regimes of water flow are modeled: open-channel flow with no ice; flow under moving or stationary ice; high Reynolds number porous flow through grounded and floating ice masses; and flow transported in the interstices of moving ice masses. In this study we investigate the forces exerted by an ice run on a cylindrical pier ice control structure. We initiate an ice run by holding ice at the upstream end of a channel. When the ice is released it is carried downstream by the surge. The ice is stopped by a row of piers placed in a line across the channel. We analyze the time history of the forces exerted by the ice on the piers and {{the momentum of the}} moving ice. This allows us to investigate the relationship between the rate of change of momentum and the forces on the piers, channel banks, and bottom. The simulated moments on the ice control structure are compared with results of a similar physical model experiment. 1...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) {{methods for}} reactor {{analysis}} {{are most often}} employed as a benchmark tool for other transport and diffusion methods. In this work, we identify and resolve {{a few of the}} issues associated with using MC as a reactor design tool. It is widely thought that MC tallies converge at an ideal rate proportional to the inverse of the square root of the number of tally batches. This is true only if tally batches are independent from one another. For a high dominance ratio light water reactor such as the BEAVRS model, significant correlation is present and the convergence rate was much slower. This work developed a means for analytically predicting tally convergence rates when batches are correlated. Analyses supported these findings and confirmed less than ideal convergence rates. For highly correlated problems, it is recommended to reduce error by running additional independent simulations, rather than increasing the number of neutrons in each individual simulation through additional batches. Before tallies can be accumulated, the fission source must be stationary. For the BEAVRS model, this took approximately 200 fission source generations. This process can be accelerated by using coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD), a nonlinear diffusion acceleration method. CMFD was implemented in the continuous-energy MC code OpenMC. When employing this technique, the number of inactive generations was reduced by a factor of 10. Realistic reactor calculations also require thermal <b>hydraulic</b> (TH) <b>feedback</b> which was integrated into the source convergence process. The use of CMFD in addition to TH reduced the number of fission source generations by a factor of 3. Further reduction was achieved by performing nonlinear iterations between the low-order CMFD operator and TH model. Support vector regression, a machine learning algorithm, was used to construct coolant density and fuel temperature dependencies of diffusion parameters between each TH update using MC tallies. A framework was introduced to obtain relative pin power distributions with 95 % confidence intervals to 1 % with continuous-energy Monte Carlo coupled to thermal hydraulics using low-order CMFD iterations. by Bryan Robert Herman.

40|$|Abstract – The {{ability of}} point {{kinetics}} to describe dynamic processes in accelerator-driven systems (ADS) is investigated. Full three-dimensional energy-space-time dependent calculations, coupled with thermal- and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>feedback</b> effects, are performed {{and used as}} a standard of comparison. Various transient accident sequences are studied. Calculations are performed {{in the range of}} keff = 0. 9594 to 0. 9987, to provide insight into the dependence of the performance on the subcritical level. Numerical experiments are carried out on a minor-actinide loaded and lead-bismuth cooled ADS. It is shown that the point kinetics approximation is capable of providing highly accurate calculations in such systems. The results suggest better precision at lower keff-levels. It is found that subcritical operation provides features that are favorable from a point kinetics view of application. For example, reduced sensitivity to system reactivity perturbations effectively mitigates any spatial distortions. If a subcritical reactor is subject to a change in the strength of the external source, or a change in reactivity within the subcritical range, the neutron population will adjust to a new stationary level. Therefore, within the normal range of operation, the power predicted by the point kinetics method and the associated error in comparison with the exact solution tends to approach an essentially bounded value. It was found that the point kinetics model is likely to underestimate the power rise following a reactivity insertion in an ADS, which is similar to the behavior in critical systems...|$|E
