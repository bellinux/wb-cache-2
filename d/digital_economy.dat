5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the <b>Digital</b> <b>Economy</b> Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{covers a}} new {{topic in the}} sphere of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> – consumers’ attitudes towards this phenomenon. Increasing {{transfer}} of transactions to electronic space determines the growth of the number of illegal digital operators and promotes consumers’ involvement in digital shadow trade. Scientific literature does not contain any universal definition of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy.</b> Hence, the variety of terms, interpretations and features relevant to this phenomenon is rather wide, which determines the necessity to define the precise concept of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> {{from the point of view}} of consumers as active participants in this field. This article is aimed at definition of the concept of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> from consumers’ position and identification of the measures would discourage potential consumers from participation in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy.</b> To increase the size of the survey sample, the method of “snowball” was engaged. The results of the research have revealed that consumers are inclined to distinguish criminal activities (drugs, prostitution, credential steals, etc.) from illegal economic activities, which also violate established legal norms and regulations. The participants of the survey perceive that the activities of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> are performed exceptionally in electronic space without official registration of business and evading tax payment. Participation in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> is voluntary and mutually beneficial to both transaction parties (a trader and a consumer). With reference to the results of consumers’ evaluation, definition of digital shadow activities as illegal ones, development of the efficient legal framework, containing clearly established criminal and/or administrative responsibility for a consumer as a party of digital shadow transaction, public announcement and availability of the information on illegal e-traders in e-space, availability of appropriate protection software, more intensive supervision and control, establishment of e-police department and assurance of the sufficient number of supervising officers can be considered the most efficient measures of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> prevention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} aimed at {{theoretical}} and empirical identification of economic and {{demographic characteristics of the}} subjects, operating in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy.</b> Although, in general sense, the characteristics of the subjects, operating in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy,</b> are not extremely different from the ones of the subjects, operating in traditional shadow economy, the expert evaluation has enabled to identify the distinctive features of an illegal digital market seller, who can be represented as a young or middle-aged male with higher education, a professional in his operational field. With reference to the research results, sellers in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> include the entities with officially registered activities, who are trying to evade taxation of the revenues earned from the operations in e-space. On the other hand, according to the experts, the amount of the officially accounted revenue earned by these entities may reach up to 300 EUR. Hence, the defined profile of an illegal seller, as of a subject, operating in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy,</b> proposes that a seller in <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> is an intellectually developed person with advanced professional skills, but insufficient financial earnings...|$|R

5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, {{and a second}} Jazz FM branded station was {{launched}} four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, {{and was the first}} in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radioa subsidiary of the Guardian Media Groupacquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid-2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Economy</b> Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi-national station in October 2010; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their licence agreement, the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications (Ofcom) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place.|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} {{of young people}} from troubling and disturbing online content is rightly a high policy in Western nations. However, ‘the child’ is increasingly being defined as anyone below the age of majority : 18 in most nations. The significant age and maturity difference between primary school children and teenagers are recognised in most cinema classification schemes but less nuanced in terms of regulated online content. While there is considerable evidence that younger children benefit from vigilant support regarding what they access online, the legal and policy focus upon the regulated {{protection of}} teenagers risks constraining opportunities as well as risks, and may impact upon their online behaviour in ways that lead to unintended consequences. This paper is framed in terms of recent debates around the Australian Law Reform Commission’s (ALRC’s) National Classification Scheme Review (which considered content), and the Australian Government’s Department of Broadband, Communications and the <b>Digital</b> <b>Economy’s</b> Convergence Scheme Review (Department of Broadband, Communications and the <b>Digital</b> <b>Economy’s,</b> 2011) (which considered the regulatory implications of converged media).

40|$|The <b>digital</b> sharing <b>economy</b> is {{becoming}} more and more of a necessity as the increase in urbanization means a greater need for resources. The sharing economy has only recently began to gain a lot of attention with actors from Airbnb and Uber taking over headlines and spreading across the world, but little is known about what type of impacts this phenomenon will have on society. While from another view some areas have seemed to be almost static when it comes to the adoption of such platforms. This study aims at revealing the barriers involved towards a <b>digital</b> sharing <b>economy</b> and what pathways and opportunities exist to overcome them. The qualitative case study focuses on the city of Umeå, known to be high in technical competency and world leading broadband, having almost no activity in the <b>digital</b> sharing <b>economy.</b> The study goes on to present the barriers, pathways, and opportunities related to the sharing economy and how they apply to the city of Umeå.

40|$|The article {{introduces}} a new methodology of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> estimation, {{which is based}} on the principles of the MIMIC method. This new methodology complements traditional methodologies of shadow economy estimation with such a component as <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy.</b> Our analysis of the most popular today methods of shadow economic estimation proves that, despite some of its drawbacks, the MIMIC model can be treated as the most comprehensive and appropriate method for such calculations since it takes into account both causal and indicators of shadow economy. As the causal variables here, as applied to <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy,</b> we use household access to the Internet and IT overall, the volume of non-cash payments and the use of most advanced fi nancial instruments. While as the indicators of the <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> spread we use: the volume of non-cash payments at online platforms, the frequency of cryptocurrency payments, and the cost of parcels to which customs duties have not been applied. For further empirical verifi cation of the model proposed here, numerical values of both causal variables and indicators would be necessary. Unfortunately, offi cial statistical sources are unable to provide such data in full volume, {{especially when it comes to}} cryptocurrencies and other informal payments. Thus, in our further research we plan to not only prove the practical applicability of the offered here model for estimations of <b>digital</b> shadow <b>economy</b> size as well as overall size of shadow economy on the examples of particular countries, but also to accumulate the necessary statistics for such calculations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how Intellectual Property {{regimes and}} information markets shape {{each other to}} produce geographically differentiated <b>digital</b> <b>economies.</b> The geographic variations and underlying conditions of this process are investigated through a multi-scalar comparison of various jurisdictions, geographic spaces defined by legal frameworks. The United States and the European Union (with {{a focus on the}} UK, Spain and Germany) are taken as leading examples of these spaces and studied through the lens of their respective Intellectual Property regimes to understand the dynamics in the construction of their information markets. The study is centered on the commodification and marketization of a particular good: geographic information stored and distributed through the Internet, also known as the geoweb. Geographic information (publicly financed, private and personal) is chosen as the object of study because it embodies defining features of contemporary capitalism including a) the expansion in size and value of the informational economy, b) new forms of production, distribution and consumption due to digitization and networking c) dramatic rearticulation of activities formerly dominated by the state, such as surveying and cartography. These three trends are synthesized to produce a geographic theory of the spatial and multiscalar construction of geographically variegated <b>digital</b> <b>economies,</b> which centers on the integrating vector of Intellectual Property regimes as a way to bound information within particular territories...|$|R
