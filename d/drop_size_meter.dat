40|$|ABSTRACT. A set of <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} data {{is presented}} covering {{a wide range}} of sprinkler types including single nozzle impact sprinklers with straight bore and square nozzles, and sprayheads with various types of deflector plates. <b>Drop</b> <b>sizes</b> were measured by the laser-optical method and comparisons with other types of <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> measurement techniques are presented. Distributions are parameterized with an exponential function, and a method is provided to estimate the parameters given the sprinkler type, nozzle size, and pressure head. Keywords. Irrigation, Sprinklers, <b>Drop</b> <b>size.</b> S prinkler irrigation can be defined as any irrigation system which distributes water as discrete droplets through the air. The variety of sprinkler devices available has increased dramatically in recent years, from the conventional single or double nozzle impact sprinkler with many types of nozzles to various types of deflection-plate sprinklers which influence the <b>drop</b> <b>sizes</b> and water distribution patterns over {{a wide range of}} flow rates and pressures. Accurate knowledge of <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distributions for sprinklers is important because evaporation and drift losses are controlled by the extreme small <b>size</b> ranges and <b>drop</b> impact energy on the soil is determined primarily by the largest size ranges.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} rain <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities {{is an essential}} presumption with respect to remote sensing of precipitation. Since maritime and continental aerosol is significantly different yielding to differences in cloud <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities, maritime and continental rain <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities may be different, too. In fact only a {{little is known about}} differences in rain <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities between land and sea {{due to a lack of}} suitable data over the sea. To fill in this gap measurements were performed during the recent 10 years at different locations in Germany and on board of research vessels over the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean. Measurements were done by using an optical disdrometer (ODM 470, Großklaus et al., 1998), which is designed especially to perform precipitation measurements on moving ships and under high wind speeds. Temporal resolution of measurements is generally 1 minute, total number of time series is about 220000. To investigate differences in <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities over land and over sea measurements have been divided into four classes on the basis of prevailing continental or maritime influence: land measurements, coastal measurements, measurements in areas of semi-enclosed seas, and open sea measurements. In general differences in <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities are small between different areas. A Kolmogoroff Smirnoff test does not give any significant difference between <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities over land, coastal areas, semi-enclosed, and open seas at an error rate of 5 %.

For this purpose, monodisperse and polydisperse rain events were generated in the laboratory {{for a wide range}} of rain rates and various <b>drop</b> <b>sizes.</b> The water droplets reached the surface at terminal velocity. In all cases, the radar average power is well modelled by a linear function of the power spectral density at the Bragg resonant wavelength. The <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> is found to have a strong impact on the spectral shape of the ring-waves and on their total energy. A log-Gaussian model characterizes well the ring-wave spectra and empirical expressions of the spectrum parameters are given. Ring-wave energy increases with rain rate and <b>drop</b> <b>size.</b> and is found to be proportional to the kinetic energy of a single drop, indicating that one may use a model in which all drops contribute to the ring-wave energy in proportion to their squared momentum.
