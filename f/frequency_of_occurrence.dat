This study is conducted to reveal the kinds and uses of transitional markers signaling reason and conclusion in argumentative compositions. It is qualitative in nature. The writer analyzed 16 argumentative compositions of Writing 3 students of the academic year 2006 / 2007 of the English department of Widya Mandala Catholic University Surabaya. The study reveals that there were 31 (156 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> transitional markers signaling reason and conclusion found, which consists <b>of</b> 21 (110 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> markers functioning as reason, and 10 (46 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> others functioning as conclusion. The forms of transitional markers signaling reason were: word and phrase form. The writer found 7 (83 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> word and 14 (27 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> phrase forms <b>of</b> reason transitional markers. She also found 4 (34 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> word form, 3 (9 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> phrase form, and 3 (3 <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences)</b> clause form <b>of</b> transitional markers signaling conclusion. Among all of those transitional markers, there were 93 times of appropriate and 17 times of inappropriately used transitional markers signaling reason; and 37 times of appropriate and 9 times of inappropriately used transitional markers signaling conclusion. Based on the findings of the analysis above, the writer concludes that the inappropriateness used of the transitional markers found mostly happen in the presence of comma and because of the influence of Bahasa Indonesia. In line with these findings, some suggestions are given: 1. For Reading and Writing teachers. They should teach their students how to use transitional markers signaling reason ad conclusion appropriately. Besides, they are also expected to give their students assignments to read and write argumentative texts. 2. For English Department students to be more active in reading and writing argumentative texts in order to improve their comprehension of how to write a coherent argumentative composition through the use of transitional markers. 3. For the further researches to conduct their study on transitional markers (kinds, how they are used, and why) in other types of writing...|$|R

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

In contrast to this approach we use the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the most frequent words of the entire written language.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} model of protein conformations where the conformations are {{combinations}} of short fragments from some small set. For these fragments we consider a distribution <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> pairs (sequence of amino acids, conformation), averaged over some balls in the spaces of sequences and conformations. These frequencies can be estimated due to smallness of epsilon-entropy of the set of conformations of protein fragments. We consider statistical potentials for protein fragments which describe the mentioned <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> and discuss model of free energy of a protein where the free energy is equal to a sum of statistical potentials of the fragments. We also consider contribution of contacts of fragments to the energy of protein conformation, and contribution from statistical potentials of some hierarchical set of larger protein fragments.

25|$|In {{cases of}} ICC, the {{elevated}} copper intake {{is due to}} heating and/or storing milk in copper or brass vessels. ICT cases, on the other hand, are due to elevated copper concentrations in water supplies. Although exposures to elevated concentrations of copper are commonly found in both diseases, some cases appear to develop in children who are exclusively breastfed or who receive only low levels of copper in water supplies. The currently prevailing hypothesis is that ICT {{is due to a}} genetic lesion resulting in impaired copper metabolism combined with high copper intake. This hypothesis was supported by the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> of parental consanguinity in most of these cases, which is absent in areas with elevated copper in drinking water and in which these syndromes do not occur.|$|E
25|$|Common intuition {{suggests}} that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then roughly half {{of the time it}} will turn up heads, and the other half it will turn up tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the number of heads to the number of tails will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E
25|$|A genetic {{predisposition}} to keratoconus has been observed, {{with the disease}} running in certain families, and incidences reported of concordance in identical twins.

Most genetic studies agree on an autosomal dominant model of inheritance. A rare, autosomal dominant form of severe keratoconus with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of mir-184, a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens. Keratoconus is diagnosed more often in people with Down's syndrome, though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined.|$|E
