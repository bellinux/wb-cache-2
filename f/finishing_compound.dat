At the age of 29 days they were divided into two batches: the first batch consisting of 100 males (control batch) received one single type of compound feed in the period 29 – 56 days (growth feed specific to the second phase of quail youth growth, with 3140 kcal ME/kg c. f. and 22. 50 % CP). The experimental batch of 100 males received two types of compound feed (compound feed for the phase two of raising the youth quail in the period 29 – 42 days and a compound feed for adult quails in the period 43 – 56 days (value 2810 kcal ME/kg c. f. and 19. 81 % CP). All birds were subjected to a lighting program with asymmetric time intervals with the duration of 16 hours a day (10 hours light + 2 hours darkness + 6 hours light + 6 hours darkness).    The average live weight at the age of 49 days was 3. 29 % and with 2. 95 % at the age of 56 days higher in the experimental batch compared to the control group, while the average weight of the carcass was higher too in the experimental batch at the age of 49 days (with 1. 00 %), and at the age of 56 days (with 1. 80 %).    Considering that there have been good performances at the experimental batch, it is advisable that when quail males are raised after 49 days of age in the direction of meat production, to use in the week 7 th and 8 th of growth a compound feed recipe with energy level and protein level lower compared to the period 28 – 42 days, which also contributes to the reduction of production costs for quail meat...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of the light and compound feed on growth performance into young quail mixed-population of Baloteşti was organized an experiment on 400 chicken quails. It has studied the impact of a illumination program with asymmetrical hourly intervals (10 L+ 2 N+ 6 L+ 6 N) compared with a program of continuous lighting in day period (16 L+ 8 N). It was used 3 types of compound feed: for growth, finishing and for adult quails. The growth performance of young quails during the period 28 - 49 days were superior in the case of lots of female animals (B 1) and male (B 2) compared with the consignments of female (A 1) and male (A 2). The average live weight at the age of 49 days was higher with 9. 67 % at the females from the lot B 1 compared with females from lot A 1, while to male this was higher with 6. 95 % at the males of the lot B 2 compared with males from the lot A 2. In the period 49 - 56 days the weight gain at males from the lot A 2 - 2 has been with 6. 30 g/head higher than to male from the lot of A 2 - 1, and feed consumption rate has been reduced by 19. 10 g c. f. /g weight gain to the consignment A 2 - 2 from the consignment A 2 - 1.

40|$|Textile {{effluents}} usually contain {{high concentrations}} of inorganics as well as organics, and are therefore difficult to treat. Membrane processes {{can be used for}} many of these wastewaters in the textile industry. Two typical examples are discussed: (1) the use of nanofiltration for the treatment of exhausted dye baths, in view of water recycling, and (2) the use of ultrafiltration for the removal of spin finish from waste water resulting from rinsing of textile fibres. Both applications are in principle feasible, but in practice the process is negatively influenced by membrane fouling. In the first application, fouling is assumed to be caused by (ad) sorption of organic compounds, which has a large influence because of the high concentrations used in textile dyeing. Furthermore, the high salt concentrations result in a decrease of the effective driving force because of the high osmotic pressures obtained for typical dye baths. Experimental results are discussed, and the applicability of nanofiltration is related to the characteristics of the dye baths for different dyeing methods. In the second application, the concentration of organic compounds is relatively low, but because of the hydrophobic nature of the spin <b>finish</b> <b>compounds,</b> a significant effect of membrane fouling is expected. An improvement is suggested by using nanofiltration membranes instead of ultrafiltration membranes. status: publishe...|$|R

Visualization, interactive editing ability and layout of graphs are critical issues when analyzing the underlying relational information. There are many commercial and non-commercial graph visualization tools. However, overall support for compound or hierarchically organized graph representations is very limited. We introduce a new open-source editing and layout framework named Chisio for compound graphs. Chisio is developed as a free, easy-to-use and powerful academic graph visualization tool, supporting various automatic layout algorithms. It is written in Java and based on Eclipse’s Graphical Editing Framework (GEF). Chisio {{can be used as}} a <b>finished</b> generic <b>compound</b> graph editor with standard graph editing facilities such as zoom, scroll, add or remove graph objects, move, and resize. Object property and layout options dialogs are provided to modify existing graph object properties and layout options, respectively.

Saved graphs or GraphML formatted files created by other tools can be loaded into Chisio. Furthermore, a highlight mechanism is provided to emphasize subgraphs of users interest. The framework has an architecture suitable for easy customization of the tool for end-users’ specific needs as well. Also Chisio offers several layout styles from the basic spring embedder to hierarchical layout to compound spring embedder to circular layout.

40|$|Today {{compound}} sculptured surfaces {{have been}} widely used to design complicated shapes and details of mechanical parts in the automotive, aeronautical, die and mold industries. The technology of machining these surfaces with high quality and efficiency is badly needed in the manufacturing industry. In Computer numerical control (CNC) <b>finish</b> machining of <b>compound</b> sculptured surface parts, local gouging is a major concern due to the geometric mismatch between the engaged regions of the cutting surface and the part surfaces. Specifically, local gouging will occur at a cutter contact point along the tangent direction, in which the normal curvature of the cutting surface is less than that of the part surface. In the past years, some researchers have applied curvature analysis techniques to local gouging detection for a single surface patch; however, a practicable, reliable approach to evaluating the geometric mis/match between the cutting and part surfaces has not yet been available. My research originally proposes an improved approach to detecting potential local gouging for compound surface patches and to determine an optimum tool size for local gouge free machining. This approach applies comprehensive curvature analysis to the engaged regions between the cutting and part surfaces in 3 -axis finish machining by using different standard cutters.

Presently, majority of the eutectic Pb-free solders are Sn-based and the most promising is ternary SnAgCu (SAC) solder. However, SnAgCu solder tends to become brittle in nature and excessive solder interfacial reactions. An attractive approach is by introducing alloying elements such as Ce, Fe and Zn into the SnAgCu solder, which allows for an increase of the mechanical properties and refine the solder microstructure as well as improve the wetting properties. The present work focuses {{on the effects of}} a series of elemental additions of 0. 5 % Ce, Fe and Zn into the basic Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder, in attempt to reduce the intermetallic compound (IMC) growth as well as joint reliability and reflow properties of the solder on Ni-P surface <b>finish.</b> The intermetallic <b>compound</b> Cu 6 Sn 5, containing a small amount of dissolved Ni, was found to form preferentially on the Ni coating.

40|$|Plasticizers {{are widely}} used as {{additives}} {{for the production of}} PVC and other types of plastics. They have been observed to leach out of the solid matrix {{over the course of the}} lifetime of the <b>finished</b> product. These <b>compounds</b> have now been observed across the globe and in different environments. The main focus of this work is the study of the interactions of industrial plasticizers with soil microorganisms including bacteria, yeast and fungi. This research is concerned with the microbial degradation of plasticizers such as di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and di- 2 -ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA). In particular, the study has focused on the stable metabolites produced during biodegradation, including 2 -ethylhexanol and 2 -ethylhexanoic acid. The first step was to show that these toxic metabolites were found in significant concentrations in the environment. In addition, a series of experiments with a variety of organisms showed how wide spread the ability to produce these metabolites was. Most organisms tested were capable of interacting with the plasticizers and many of these produced the metabolites. It was apparent that these metabolites could have appreciable stability and an in-depth study with one species of bacteria, R. rhodochrous, showed that the entire initial 2 -ethylhexanol component incorporated in the original plasticizers could be accounted for. Some of this was volatile and found in the exit gas of the reactor. This included all of the 2 -ethylhexanol and some of the 2 -ethylhexanol. These compounds may contribute to the impairment of the quality of indoor air. An overall mass balance showed that while the bacterium could eventually oxidize the 2 -ethylhexanol released by hydrolysis to 2 -ethylhexanoic acid, it could not degrade this acid. Thus, a summation of the quantities of each of the various metabolites generated equaled the original amount of 2 -ethylhexanol in the plasticizer. A mathematical model was then constructed to include all of the above features of the interaction of R. rhodochrous with the plasticizers DEHA and DEHP. This model included terms for the biological interactions and enzyme kinetics as well as the toxicity and inhibition of bacterial growth by the plasticizers and their metabolites. The increased understanding of the interaction of microbes with plasticizers will lead to a better understanding of the environmental impact of these compounds and their metabolites. The results of this study also demonstrate that when assessing the environmental impact of a compound, it is essential that not only should the impact of the parent compound be considered, but it is essential that the assessment process must also account for impacts associated with degradation products...|$|R
40|$|In a study {{conducted}} by the US Geological Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 water samples were collected at selected locations within a drinking-water-treatment (DWT) facility and from the two streams that serve the facility to evaluate the potential for wastewater-related organic contaminants to survive a conventional treatment process and persist in potable-water supplies. Stream-water samples as well as samples of raw, settled, filtered, and finished water were collected during low-flow conditions, when the discharge of effluent from upstream municipal sewage-treatment plants accounted for 37 – 67 % of flow in stream 1 and 10 – 20 % of flow in stream 2. Each sample was analyzed for 106 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) that represent a diverse group of extensively used chemicals. Forty OWCs were detected in one or more samples of stream water or raw-water supplies in the treatment plant; 34 were detected in more than 10 % of these samples. Several of these compounds also were frequently detected in samples of <b>finished</b> water; these <b>compounds</b> include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, fragrance compounds, flame retardants and plasticizers, cosmetic compounds, and a solvent. The detection of these compounds suggests that they resist removal through conventional water-treatment processes. Other compounds that also were frequently detected in samples of stream water and rawwater supplies were not detected in samples of finished water; these include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, disinfectants, detergent metabolites, and plant and animal steroids. The non-detection of these compounds indicates that their concentrations are reduced to levels less than analytical detection limits or that they are transformed to degradates through conventional DWT processes. Concentrations of OWCs detected in finished water generally were low and did not exceed Federal drinking-water standards or lifetime health advisories, although such standards or advisories have not been established for most of these compounds. Also, at least 11 and as many as 17 OWCs were detected in samples of finished water. Drinking-water criteria currently are based on the toxicity of individual compounds and not combinations of compounds. Little is known about potential human-health effects associated with chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple OWCs through routes such as drinking water. The occurrence in drinking-water supplies of many of the OWCs analyzed for during this study is unregulated and most of these compounds have not been routinely monitored for in the Nation’s source- or potable-water supplies. This study provides the first documentation that many of these compounds can survive conventional water-treatment processes and occur in potable-water supplies. It thereby provides information {{that can be used in}} setting research and regulatory priorities and in designing future monitoring programs. The results of this study also indicate that improvements in water-treatment processes may benefit from consideration of the response of OWCs and other trace organic contaminants to specific physical and chemical treatments...|$|R
