25|$|With the {{installation}} of Pakubuwana, the Dutch substantially increased their control over the interior of Central Java. Pakubuwana <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> willing to agree to anything the VOC asked of him. In 1705 he agreed to cede the regions of Cirebon and eastern part of Madura (under Cakraningrat II), in which Mataram had no real control anyway, to the VOC. The VOC was given Semarang as new headquarters, the right to build fortresses anywhere in Java, a garrison in the kraton in Kartasura, monopoly over opium and textiles, {{and the right to}} buy as much rice as they wanted. Mataram would pay an annual tribute of 1300 metric tons of rice. Any debt made before 1705 was cancelled. In 1709, Pakubuwana I made another agreement with the VOC in which Mataram would pay annual tribute of wood, indigo and coffee (planted since 1696 by VOC’s request) in addition to rice. These tributes, more than anything else, made Pakubuwana I the first genuine puppet of the Dutch. On paper, these terms seemed very advantageous to the Dutch, since the VOC itself was in financial difficulties during the period of 1683–1710. But the ability of the king to fulfil the terms of agreement depended largely on the stability of Java, for which VOC has made a guarantee. It turned out later that the VOC’s military might was incapable of such a huge task.|$|E

500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I {{had no idea what was}} going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Lister's role as Zoe saw her {{nominated}} for the [...] "Sexiest Female" [...] award at The British Soap Awards, however she lost to co-star Roxanne McKee. Lister was asked in an interview if she was disappointed to not win the award. She replied: [...] "Not at all! It was lovely to be nominated, and also a bit hilarious, but beyond that, I wasn't desperate to win. I really wasn't bothered! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> happy that Roxanne [...] won it — and I guessed she might do anyway." [...] When Zoe's affair with Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) began, there was some controversy over the storyline, due to the age gap between the pair. However, Hirst stated: [...] "I think the controversy has subsided somewhat. It's not an illicit affair, it's known about now. It was shocking to some people at the beginning but it wasn't by any means illegal. There were some complications but they are both grown-ups!" [...] The parachute stunt won 'Spectacular Scene Of The Year' at the 2010 British Soap Awards. At the 2010 Inside Soap Awards the storyline gained nominations {{in the category of}} [...] "Best Stunt". Kris Green of Digital Spy described the skydive {{as one of the best}} stunts he had seen in a long time, commenting that Zoe's reaction to Sarah's death made him shed a tear, and that the episode on a whole was [...] "amazing". The parachute stunt won 'Spectacular Scene Of The Year' at the 2010 British Soap Awards. The Daily Mail opined that Zoe took an [...] "interesting turn" [...] when she slept with Sarah. Asian News International included Sarah and Zoe second on their top ten [...] "girl-on-girl kisses on TV" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2016 feature via The Quietus, Kavus Torabi {{shed light}} on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. [...] It was an {{extraordinarily}} interesting and brilliant time for me because we’d already talked {{a great deal about}} what the plan was {{for the next few years}} for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> happy to do that. The way things stand, [...] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there’s far more stuff completed that hasn’t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E
