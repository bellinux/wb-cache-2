40|$|Introduction: <b>Dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> {{is one of}} {{a number}} of cobalt {{compounds}} that have been studied in the treatment of cyanide poisoning, their efficacy being based upon the fact that cyanide combines with cobalt to form relatively non-toxic complexes. Inorganic cobalt salts are quite toxic (cyanide and cobalt antagonise one another's toxicity) and complexes such as <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> were studied with the aim of identifying compounds that were less acutely toxic, but which retained the antidotal properties of cobalt salts. The proprietary preparation, Kelocyanor™, contains free cobalt and glucose as well as <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate.</b> Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the published evidence for the efficacy and adverse effects of <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate.</b> Methods: A Pubmed search was undertaken for the period 1961 –September 2015. The search terms were “dicobalt edetate”, “cobalt edetate” and “Kelocyanor”, which produced 24 relevant citations. A review of the references in four relevant books (L'intoxication cyanhydrique et son traitement, Clinical and Experimental Toxicology of Cyanides, Antidotes for Poisoning by Cyanide and Antidotes) produced three further relevant papers, making a total of 27 papers. Efficacy of dicobalt edetate: There is evidence from animal pharmacodynamic studies that <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> is an effective cyanide antidote in experimental animals. Some 39 cases of human poisoning treated with <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> have been reported, but in only nine cases were blood cyanide concentrations measured, although administration of <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> procured survival in four of the seven patients with concentrations in the lethal range (> 3. 0 [*]mg/L). It is unlikely that death in any of the adequately documented fatal cases was attributable to treatment failure with <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate,</b> as it is probable that they all had suffered anoxic brain damage before treatment could be initiated. Furthermore, in one case, acute gold toxicity contributed substantially to death. Adverse effects of dicobalt edetate: Adverse effects reported have included hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, retrosternal pain, sweating, palpebral, facial and laryngeal oedema, vomiting, urticaria and/or a feeling of impending doom. Such effects appear to be more prevalent where the antidote has been administered without evidence of substantial systemic poisoning or where other antidotes have been used which might have been expected also to combine with cyanide. Although the adverse effects observed were doubtless unpleasant, and some were severe, no fatal reactions were found. Conclusions: <b>Dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> is an effective cyanide antidote when given to patients with systemic cyanide poisoning, but it has the potential to give rise to adverse reactions, particularly when administered in the absence of intoxicatio...|$|E
40|$|The antidotal {{potency of}} a cobalt salt (acetate), of <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate,</b> of {{hydroxocobalamin}} and of cobinamide against hydrocyanic acid was examined mainly on mice and rabbits. All the compounds were active antidotes {{for up to}} twice the LD 50; under some conditions for larger doses. The most successful was cobalt acetate for rabbits (5 ×LD 50), which was effective at a molar cyanide/cobalt (CN/Co) ratio of 5, but had as a side-effect intense purgation. Hydroxocobalamin was irregular in action, {{but on the whole}} was most effective for mice (4. 5 ×LD 50 at a molar ratio of 1), and had no apparent side effects. <b>Dicobalt</b> <b>edetate,</b> at molar ratios of up to 2, was more effective for rabbits (3 ×LD 50) than for mice (2 ×LD 50), but had fewer side effects than cobalt acetate. The effect of thiosulphate was to augment the efficacy of <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> and, in mice, that of hydroxocobalamin; but, apparently, in rabbits, to reduce that of hydroxocobalamin. Cobinamide, at a molar ratio of 1, was slightly more effective than hydroxocobalamin on rabbits and also less irregular in its action. Cobalt acetate by mouth was effective against orally administered hydrocyanic acid. The oxygen uptake of the body, reduced by cyanide, is rapidly reinstated when one of the cobalt antidotes has been successfully administered...|$|E

40|$|Cyanide is a toxin {{and one of}} {{the most}} rapidly acting fatal poisons that human being is aware. If it is not treated promptly, encountering to cyanide poison will lead to die in minutes.

40|$|Summary: The {{probability}} of benefit generally outweighs {{the risk of}} adverse reactions for antidotes such as N-acetylcysteine used for treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning, and naloxone used in opioid poisoning. For some antidotes, such as <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> in cyanide poisoning, administration carries high risk, and the clinical decision to use the antidote is only taken in severe poisoning. Use of an antidote rarely replaces the need for supportive measures. Except for N-acetylcysteine in paracetamol poisoning, the clinical state and not plasma concentration dictates whether an antidote is used. In pregnancy, it is usually reasoned that treatment of the mother takes precedence and provides the best chance for fetal survival, notwithstanding worries about teratogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Cyanide {{poisoning}} is uncommon, but generates {{interest because}} of the presumed utility of an antidote immediately available in those areas with {{a high risk of}} cyanide exposure. As part of its regular review of guidelines, the Australian Resuscitation Council conducted a systematic review of the human evidence for the use of various proposed cyanide antidotes, and a narrative review of the relevant pharmacological and animal studies. There have been no relevant comparative or placebo-controlled human trials. Nine case series were identified. Treatment with hydroxocobalamin was reported in a total of 361 cases. No serious adverse effects of hydroxocobalamin were reported, and many patients with otherwise presumably fatal poisoning survived. Sodium thiosulphate use was reported in two case series, similarly with no adverse effects. Treatment with a combination of sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite and sodium thiosulphate was reported in 74 patients, with results indistinguishable from those of hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulphate. No case series using <b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate</b> or 4 -dimethylaminophenol were identified, but successful use in single cases has been reported. Hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulphate differ from alternatives in having negligible adverse effects, and on the basis of current evidence are the antidotes of choice. The indications for the use of an antidote, the requirements for supportive care and a recommended approach for workplaces where there is a risk of cyanide poisoning are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{milestones}} in antidotal therapies for cyanide (CN) spanning early remedies, current antidotal {{systems and}} research towards next generation therapies. CN {{has been a}} part of plant defense mechanisms for millions of years. It became industrially important in the nineteenth century with the advent of CN assisted gold mining and the use of CN as a pest control agent. The biochemical basis of CN poisoning was actively studied and key mechanisms were understood as early as 1929. These fundamental studies led to a variety of antidotes, including indirect CN binders that generate methemoglobin, direct CN binders such as hydroxocobalamin, and sulfur donors that convert CN to the less toxic thiocyanate. Research on blood gases at the end of the twentieth century shed new light on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. The discovery of NO's ability to compete with CN for enzymatic binding sites provided a previously missed explanation for the rapid efficacy of NO generating antidotes such as the nitrites. Presently used CN therapies include: methemoglobin/NO generators (e. g., sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, and dimethyl aminophenol), sulfur donors (e. g., sodium thiosulfate and glutathione), and direct binding agents [(e. g., hydroxocobalamin and dicobalt salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<b>dicobalt</b> <b>edetate)</b> ]. A strong effort is being made to explore novel antidotal systems and to formulate them for rapid administration at the point of intoxication in mass casualty scenarios. New antidotes, formulations, and delivery systems are enhancing bioavailability and efficacy and hold promise for a new generation of improved CN countermeasures...|$|E
