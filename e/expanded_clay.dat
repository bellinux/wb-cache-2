50|$|The {{use of the}} <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> {{aggregate}} is economically recommended, {{particularly in}} the concrete production, since it reduces the bulk density while minimizing the total weight of the constructions. It can be concluded {{that the use of}} <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> is very important in civil constructions, due to its overall weight, cost and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> {{aggregate}} (LECA) or <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> (exclay) is a {{light weight}} aggregate made by heating clay to around 1200 C in a rotary kiln. The yielding gases expand the clay by thousands of small bubbles forming during heating producing a honeycomb structure. LECA has an approximately round or potato shape due to circular movement in the kiln, and is available in different sizes and densities. LECA is used to make lightweight concrete products and other uses.|$|E

I t is believed that <b>expanded</b> <b>clays</b> retain their pore water to greater depths of burial than do other clays, {{and that it is}} this water which transports much of the hydro-carbon.

40|$|A {{review of}} the McNeal clay {{swelling}} model, including its underpinning assumptions and the method for determining its parameters, was undertaken. Limitations of the model include model parameter identification, the fixed threshold exchangeable sodium percentage level at which hydraulic conductivity begins to decline, and {{the assumption that the}} <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> will always be 10 % of the soil. To overcome these problems, an improved form of the model that accommodates a range of clay content is proposed. The modified model was used to estimate the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity in the three McNeal groups of soils containing different percentages of <b>expanding</b> <b>clay.</b> The model produced good agreement between the observed and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities over the entire range of irrigation salinity (3 – 200 mmolc/L) and sodicity used for the original swelling model. The modified model was also successfully validated against three new sets of relative hydraulic conductivity data. The generalization of interlayer clay swelling in the modified model is more appropriately described as determining the dispersive potential of a given solution, rather than physical interlayer swelling. Consequently, this modified model more accurately predicts the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity {{as a function of the}} sodicity and salinity of the applied water. ...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} at 600 ~ {{has been the}} usual procedure for irreversible collapse of <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> minerals prior to determination of the external surface area of clays and soils by glycerol retention. Evidence is presented showing that this treatment is unsuitable since it greatly reduces the external surface area of certain minerals and in-cre~ses that of others. Saturation with the triethylammonium cation avoids these difficulties and produces an effect analogous {{to the collapse of}} expanding minerals by stabilizing their basal spacing at 13. 3 /~. This prevents the entrance of glycerol between the unit layers and confines the sorption to the external surfaces of the particles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{nature of}} the parent {{material}} from which flint clay or flint-like clay is derived may modify {{the texture of the}} clay as observed by SEM. Flint clays occurring in Pennsylvanian-age swamp basins into which were transported residues weathered from sedimentary country rock exhibit a texture of interlocked kaolin pockets and sheaves. On the other hand, flint clay or flint-like clay derived by weathering of volcanic ash exhibits a texture resembling, on a micro-scale, the scalloped, "oak-leaff pattern of montmorillonite. The interpretation is that an <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> having a transitional role between the ash and the kaolinite is the donor source of the micro-scalloped pattern inherited by kaolinite.

For different sizes of CEC aggregate with the same replacement of sand and entrained water (see CEC 1 and CEC 1 A), similar results are presented. But the best effect was found with the smaller aggregate (GS < 2  mm), in accordance with recent studies of water flow from <b>expanded</b> <b>clays</b> saturated with a concrete colored pigment solution and spatial distribution of LWA (Akcay and Tasdemir 2010). For the same grain size (1  mm < GS <  2  mm), the autogenous shrinkage was basically eliminated by using the two LWA: CEC 1 and Pumice 1. This was probably a result of CEC and Pumice pore structure.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the undrained shear strength of fine-grained soils and the water content can be described with a nonlinear function in which the type of soil is determined by two parameters. It {{is well known that}} these parameters depend mainly on the mineral compositions of soilsč these relationships, however, have not yet been investigated. The findings describedin this paper define those mineralogical properties of soils which determine the values of both parameters. Experimentally obtained results suggest that the parameters primarily depend {{on the size of the}} clay minerals,their quantity in soil composition, and the interlayer water quantityin the <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> minerals. As this dependence is well defined, the parameters, and thus the undrained shear strength at different water content, can be defined from knowledge of these mineralogical soil properties...|$|R

50|$|Construction work on {{the station}} began in December 1933, and the {{engineers}} were faced with extremely difficult soil conditions from the outset. The area under Lubyanka square is made of Jurassic clay, beneath which are layers of quicksand and Carboniferous clay. The Metro station was planned to rest {{on top of the}} Carboniferous clay, which was thought to be firm enough to support its weight. It was quickly discovered, however, that the clay was much softer than anticipated due to the proximity of an underground channel of the Neglinnaya River and also tended to swell greatly when exposed to air. This meant that the tunnels had to be built one section at a time, very quickly, in order to allow the concrete to set before the pressure exerted by the <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> increased {{to the point where the}} wooden forms could no longer contain it.|$|R
40|$|Organophilic clay {{particles}} {{were added to}} a standard intumescent formulation and, since the role of clay expansion or intercalation is still a matter of much controversy, several clays {{with varying degrees of}} interlayer distances were evaluated. The composites were obtained by blending the nanostructured clay and the intumescent system with a polyethylenic copolymer. The flame-retardant properties of the materials were evaluated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI), the UL- 94 rating and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the addition of highly <b>expanded</b> <b>clays</b> to the ammonium polyphosphate and pentaerythritol formulation does not significantly increase the flame retardancy of the mixture, when measured by the LOI and UL- 94. However, when clays with smaller basal distances were added to the intumescent formulation, a synergistic effect was observed. In contrast, the simple addition of clays to the copolymer, without the intumescent formulation, did not increase the fire retardance of the materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Ion-exchange {{experiments}} in <b>expanding</b> <b>clay</b> minerals conducted {{over a wide}} range of surface ionic compositions and ionic strength produce variable mass-action selectivity coefficients. When the ex-changing ions are of unequal charge, tactoid structure appears to influence selectivity, although configu-rational entropy of adsorbed ions may also generate variable selectivity. The degree of deviation from ideal mass-action exchange is related to the dissimilarity of the ions undergoing exchange. Data involving tri-valent ion adsorption on smectites suggest that mass-action is a poor approximation when the adsorbing and desorbing ions have different hydration energies and charge. No form of exchange quation is suc-cessful in describing ion exchange {{for a wide range of}} experimental conditions, although the fluctuation of the selectivity coefficient follows consistent trends with changing experimental conditions. The strong ad-sorption of high-charge ions on clays is not exothermic, but must be driven by the increasing disorder of ions and/or water...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{tremendous}} surface area and preponderance of reactive adsorption sites, clay minerals adsorb organic matter components {{in such a}} way as to render them insoluble in common extractants. Studies with mined clays and single adsorbates have shown that polar compounds and non–ionic compounds are adsorbed on clay, particularly on the basal surfaces of <b>expanding</b> <b>clays.</b> Polyuronide is usually negatively adsorbed by sodium montmorillonite, but quite strongly adsorbed when aluminum ions were present on the exchange complex. The Harmattan dust and humin sample in which most of the organic material were removed by extraction with NaOH solutions were examined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA).

In a systematic test of 23 mineral substrates (no organic matter), Jauch and Fischer (2000) found that all trended towards acidification over the 7 -year study period. Lava substrates fell from between pH  7.5 and 8.2 (in 1993) to 5.7 and 6.2 (by 2000); <b>expanded</b> <b>clays</b> from between pH  6.7 and 9.6 (1993) to 5.1 and 6.0 (2000); and expanded shale from between pH  8.1 and 9.0 (1993) to 4.8 and 6.3 (2000). The most stable substrates tested were those composed of brick, with pH values declining from between 7.0 and 9.0 (1993) to 5.8 and 7.7 (2000). Another study of twelve substrates {{over a period of}} up to 16 years, which included the same aggregates described above plus others, noted that pH drops significantly in the first years after installation (Liesecke, 2006). The apparent drop in pH suggests that the materials comprising EGR substrates lack sufficient buffering capacity. These effects are discussed in detail further on.|$|R
