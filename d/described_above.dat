50|$|A type of {{playground}} {{called a}} playscape can provide {{children with the}} necessary feeling of ownership that Moore <b>describes</b> <b>above.</b> Playscapes can also provide parents with the assurance of their child's safety and wellbeing, {{which may not be}} prevalent in an open field or wooded area.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, silicon does {{react with}} vacancies, {{creating}} the <b>described</b> <b>above</b> optical absorption at 738nm. The assumed mechanism is trapping of migrating vacancy by substitutional silicon {{resulting in the}} Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{applications}} <b>described</b> <b>above</b> for integers {{carry over to}} polynomials. The Euclidean algorithm {{can be used to}} solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined.|$|E
5|$|The 14th Dalai Lama {{has also}} {{explicitly}} {{laid out his}} theory of mind as experiential dualism which is <b>described</b> <b>above</b> under {{the different types of}} dualism.|$|E

5000|$|Next {{definitions}} {{hold for}} all the distances and therefore the symbol [...] denotes {{the distance between the}} distribution [...] and the distribution [...] using one of the distances that we <b>describe</b> <b>above.</b> Although learnability of a class of distributions can be defined using any of these distances, applications refer to a specific distance.|$|R
50|$|There are tombs {{combining}} {{characteristics of}} the two <b>described</b> here <b>above.</b>|$|R
5|$|The four-category {{division}} <b>described</b> <b>above</b> {{appeared in}} his 1934 book, The Method of Sociology. By 1958 he had reformulated the division, and was speaking instead of social relations, social roles, social groups, and societies.|$|E
5|$|The strikeout: as <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> {{recorded}} {{against a}} batter who makes three strikes before putting {{the ball into}} play or being awarded a free advance to first base (see also uncaught third strike).|$|E
5|$|These oils are {{extracted}} from {{plants that are}} cultivated solely for producing oil-based biofuel. These, plus the major oils <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> have received much more attention as fuel oils than other plant oils.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{distributed}} and stochastic algorithms including testing their convergence in networks. The theoretical part briefly <b>describes</b> <b>above</b> mentioned algorithms, including their division, problems, advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, two distributed algorithms and two stochastic algorithms are chosen. The practical part is done by comparing the speed of convergence on various network topologies in Matlab...|$|R
50|$|The N-curve model <b>describing</b> <b>above</b> {{represents}} a significant {{characteristic of the}} tandem-queue systems, {{which is that the}} ultimate departure only depends on the bottleneck with the minimum capacity. In a practical perspective, when the resources (economy, effort, etc.) of the investment on tandem-queue systems are limited, the investment can mainly focus on the bottleneck with the worst condition.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the novel}} {{directly}} portrays the First Balkan War (1912-1913) and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), it dispatches World War I {{after a few}} pages. But {{during most of the}} book the Great War [...] "looms as an approaching catastrophe", according to Seligman. This theme might form part of what Menand <b>describes</b> <b>above</b> as the struggle between power-pursuers and power-transcenders.|$|R
5|$|This {{behavior}} is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, as <b>described</b> <b>above.</b> The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) {{is a useful}} catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene (or cod) ligands are easily displaced.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those <b>described</b> <b>above.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{supported}} {{lipid bilayer}} (SLB) as <b>described</b> <b>above</b> has achieved commercial {{success as a}} screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay PAMPA technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures, the gastrointestinal tract, blood–brain barrier and skin.|$|E

30|$|A {{universal}} primer {{was used}} for quantification of total bacteria (Table  1) for each ruminal sample individually, to standardize the amount of DNA added to the reactions, following the same qPCR conditions <b>describe</b> <b>above.</b> The qPCR reactions of all bacteria were run in duplicate, and a negative control was included in each assay to assess the specificity of qPCR reaction.|$|R
40|$|A new {{improved}} quark mass density-dependent model including u, d quarks, σ mesons, ω mesons and ρ mesons is presented. Employing this model, {{the properties}} of nuclear matter, neutron matter and neutron star are studied. We find that it can <b>describe</b> <b>above</b> properties successfully. The results given by the new improved quark mass density- dependent model and by the quark meson coupling model are compared. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
5|$|Alvarez made {{numerous}} professional {{contributions to}} aviation. During World War II {{he led the}} development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) {{for which he was}} awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar transponder, for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.|$|E
5|$|Design {{of novel}} {{biocatalysts}} and biosensors. Introducing circular permutations {{can be used}} to design proteins to catalyze specific chemical reactions, or to detect the presence of certain molecules using proteins. For instance, the GFP-calmodulin fusion <b>described</b> <b>above</b> {{can be used to}} detect the level of calcium ions in a sample.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{coefficients}} of the polynomials {{need not be}} drawn from integers, real numbers or even the complex numbers. For example, {{the coefficients}} may be drawn from a general field, such as the finite fields GF(p) <b>described</b> <b>above.</b> The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials.|$|E
30|$|We again use {{an image}} from the 3.6. 10 - 4.fc 18.i 686.PAE system to <b>describe</b> the <b>above</b> method.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, the {{estimated}} population for Four Corners, {{based on the}} larger <b>described</b> area <b>above,</b> is 100,000 people.|$|R
50|$|Different {{from the}} {{procedure}} for seed plants <b>describe</b> <b>above,</b> fusion of moss protoplasts can be initiated without electric shock but {{by the use of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG). Further, moss protoplasts do not need phytohormones for regeneration, and they do not form a callus. Instead, regenerating moss protoplasts behave like germinating moss spores. Of further note sodium nitrate and calcium ion at high pH can be used, although results are variable depending on the organism.|$|R
