25|$|Brake <b>judder</b> {{is usually}} {{perceived}} by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred through the chassis during braking.|$|E
25|$|Cold <b>judder,</b> on {{the other}} hand, {{is the result of}} uneven disc wear {{patterns}} or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Juddering,</b> shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. <b>Juddering</b> may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|R

500|$|The pay-what-you-want release, {{the first}} for a major act, made {{headlines}} worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry.

Time called it [...] "easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business" [...] and Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years." [...] The NME wrote that [...] "the music world seemed to <b>judder</b> several rimes off its axis", and praised the fact that everyone, from fans to critics, had access to the album at the same time on release day: [...] "the kind of moment of togetherness you don’t get very often."

2500|$|Hot <b>judder</b> {{is usually}} {{produced}} {{as a result}} of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop. It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around [...] to about , which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or hot spots. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort {{it in such a way}} that produces a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) comes in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceInstabilities {{generated}} by friction {{are responsible for}} many noises in real life, such as squealing, squeak or <b>juddering.</b> The challenge to model this strongly non-linear acoustic radiation problem depends on the possibility to predict the interacting contact forces with accuracy, since they entirely govern the sound radiation and the way this sound is perceived as, squeak, squeal or <b>juddering.</b> A first approach to tackle this problem consists in linearising it and to calculate a solution around a sliding equilibrium. The main advantage is the simplicity of this approach which consists in calculating the perturbed solution which will exhibit, if the system is unstable, complex solutions. We only have the possibility to detect instabilities, but {{we are in the}} impossibility to describe what appends during the instability and for example separating <b>juddering</b> from squealing. A second approach consists in finding the entire solution solving the problem in time. This second approach is used here, in the case of two interacting beams; one is pushed on the other at rest, by external constant forces or driven at constant velocity. The equations of movement of the two beams are solved explicitly in time. A Coulomb friction law is introduced in the equations of the contact point taking into account all the possible status: separated, sliding or sticking. Solutions for the contact force, contact point trajectories and acceleration contact point are calculated at each instant of time for durations of one or two seconds, allowing acoustic radiation simulations. We show how different events appear depending on the beam relative angle, friction coefficient, and how instability occurs leading to limit cycles appearance...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, many {{researchers}} have focussed their attention on parasites regarding the role they may play in causing variations in male secondary sexual traits and subsequent effects on female choice. Male age has also been suggested {{to be an important}} factor in female choice if old age reflects superior genes. This study investigated the effects that gregarine gut parasites, age, and diet have on the calling and mating behaviour of the male Texas field cricket, Gryllus integer. Male calling songs were recorded in the laboratory using a Digital Signal Processing Network. The song parameters measured were: pulse rate, pulse width, burst duration, pulses per burst, interburst interval, and percent missing pulses. The effects of parasite load and age on the various calling song parameters was investigated in crickets that were fed two different diets varying in nutritional quality. None of the calling song parameters were affected by either parasite load or age in either diet grou p. Courtship behaviour was ob served and recorded using an Eventlog recorder on an IBM computer in the laboratory. Females mated equally with paras(tized and unparasitized males and with old and young males The total duration and proportion of time spent performing each of 9 courtship displays were recorded for males on each diet. Only one display was affected by parasite load. Highly parasitized males fed the nutritionally inferior diet <b>juddered</b> for a proportionately shorter time than males with low parasite loads. Also, older males performed <b>juddering</b> and shaking antennae proportionally longer and <b>juddering</b> and raising wings for longer durations than younger males. Males that successfully mated were observed for performance of 8 post-copulatory guarding behaviour displays. None of the guarding behaviours were affected by parasite load. However, one display was affected by age, with older males performing guard turning for shorter durations than younger males. Results are discuss,ed in terms of the influence of parasites and age on female choice...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and <b>juddering</b> motion.

50|$|A {{more complex}} {{technique}} is positional time warp, which uses pixel depth {{information from the}} Z-buffer to morph the scene into a different perspective.

50|$|Doubling {{the frame}} rate of {{interlaced}} footage without duplicating or morphing frames is possible using the tfields filter to create two different frames {{from each of}} the two fields in one frame of interlaced video.

It also makes the video stream usable for framerate conversion, and creating slow-motion scenes from streams taken at standard video/TV frame rates, e.g. using cheap consumer camcorders. If the filter gets incorrect information about the top/bottom field order, the resulting output will have <b>juddering</b> motion, because the two frames created would be displayed in the wrong order.|$|R
