40|$|International audiencePyroclastic flows are {{mixtures}} of volcanic gases and particles {{that can be}} very hazardous owing to their fluid-like behavior. One possible mechanism to explain this behavior is the reduction of particles friction due to the internal <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure. To verify this hypothesis, we present a numerical model of a granular flow with high initial pore pressure that decreases with time as the gas-particle mixture propagates. First, we validate the model by reproducing laboratory experiments. Then, the numerical code is applied to pyroclastic flows of Lascar volcano (1993 eruption, Chile). The simulation reproduces the runout and the morphological features of the deposits, with lateral levées, a central channel, and a lobate front. Our results support the hypothesis of the role of <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure in pyroclastic flows and explain both the fluid-like behavior of the flows and the formation of lateral levees...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{theoretical}} investigation {{of the influence of}} <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure on the characteristics of mechanical response of gas-filled permeable materials and media. Investigation was based on computer-aided simulation by hybrid cellular automaton method. Mechanical response of the model gas-filled samples of young brown coal under unconfined (in absence of constraint) and constrained conditions was investigated. The simulation results showed that increase of the pore pressure of the gas acting on the solid skeleton leads to decrease in materials strength. This {{is due to the fact}} that the gas pressure makes an additional contribution to integral pressure acting in volume of the loaded medium. Consequences of this are earlier beginning of plastic deformation and fracture of the material. It should be noted that in the constrained conditions decreasing of material strength with increasing <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure has more pronounced nonlinear character, in comparison with similar tests for unconfined samples. This is due to the fact that loading of constrained material is accompanied by its massive cracking and, consequently, by a grater decrease of the strength characteristics of the medium...|$|E

Furthermore the solutions to eliminate them were presented. By reducing the pouring rate, the turbulent flow at the corner of casting had eased, so the <b>gas</b> <b>pores</b> could be eliminated.

First, parametric analysis for definingthe proper mesh density and time step were carried out. Then, two-dimensional computational models of the cellular structure, consisting of the base material and the <b>pore</b> <b>gas,</b> have been solved using ANSYS CFX software within the framework of finite volume elements. The results have confirmed theexpectations that the majority of heat is being transferred through the metallic base material with almost negligible heat conduction through the <b>gas</b> in <b>pores.</b> The heat conduction in closed-cell cellular metals is therefore extremely depended on the relative density but almost insensitive regarding tothe <b>gas</b> inside the <b>pore,</b> unless the relative density is very low...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{gas storage}} (UGS) in {{depleted}} hydrocarbon reservoirs is a strategic practice {{to cope with}} the growing energy demand and occurs in many places in Europe and North America. In response to summer gas injection and winter gas withdrawal the reservoir expands and contracts essentially elastically as a major consequence of the fluid (gas and water) pore pressure fluctuations. Depending on a number of factors, including the reservoir burial depth, the difference between the largest and the smallest <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure, and the geomechanical properties of the injected formation and the overburden, the porous medium overlying the reservoir is subject to three‐dimensional deformation with the related cyclic motion of the land surface being both vertical and horizontal. We present a methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of underground gas storage and sequestration from the geomechanical perspective, particularly in relation to the ground surface displacements. Long‐term records of injected and removed gas volume and fluid pore pressure in the “Lombardia” gas field, northern Italy, are available together with multiyear detection of vertical and horizontal west‐east displacement of the land surface above the reservoir by an advanced permanent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) analysis. These data have been used to calibrate a 3 ‐D fluid‐dynamic model and develop a 3 ‐D transversally isotropic geomechanical model. The latter has been successfully implemented and used to reproduce the vertical and horizontal cyclic displacements, on the range of 8 – 10 mm and 6 – 8 mm, respectively, measured between 2003 and 2007 above the reservoir where a UGS program has been underway by Stogit‐Eni S. p. A. since 1986 following a 5 year field production life. Because of the great economical interest to increase the working gas volume as much as possible, the model addresses two UGS scenarios where the <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> overpressure is pushed from the current 103 %pi, where pi is the <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure prior to the field development, to 107 %pi and 120 %pi.

The results indicate that low punch speed, short reheating duration or low reheating temperature often produces the defect of cold shuts or shrinkage porosities. On the contrary, <b>gas</b> <b>pores</b> can easily form. In addition, the reheating duration or temperature also has obvious effects on the primary particle size, fraction and morphology.

30|$|A two-axis tiltmeter {{installed}} at the summit of Semeru volcano, Indonesia, reveals two different modes of deformation, short-term and longer-term. The short-term variations are inflations precursory to the occurrence of summit explosions. The time intervals between the explosions range from several minutes to several tens of minutes, and the maximum precursory tilt change observed is about 0.1 – 0.2 μrad. This change in tilt is interpreted to reflect a shallow pressurization source, just beneath the active crater. The longer-term tilt changes are displayed {{over a period of}} several days to weeks, and a steady inflation during a period of nearly 2 weeks preceded the occurrence of pyroclastic flows on December 22, 2005. Both short-term and longer-term changes are confined to the radial tilt component, pointing toward the active crater and conduit. To explain both of these tilt changes we propose relatively shallow conduit pressurization, although at somewhat deeper levels in the case of longer-term deformation. The causative mechanisms involve gas exsolution, microlite crystallization, and rheological stiffening, which results in greater flow resistance and dynamic pressure in the upper conduit, thus causing the edifice tilts observed. The <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure in the magma builds until the threshold required to trigger explosive fragmentation is reached.|$|E

Its motion is determined by the thermal and solute gradients at each particular point. Changes of the interface temperature because of capillarity or solute redistribution as well as any perturbation of the thermal and solute field produced by the presence of non-metallic inclusions can be computed.

Initial expansion E and initial height h(0) were varied independently of one another. The flows traveled in a laminar manner.

Resistivity obtained from marine controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data provides a useful complement to seismic methods for detecting shallow hydrate and gas as they are more resistive than surrounding water saturated sediments. We acquired two CSEM lines in the west Svalbard continental slope, extending {{from the edge of the}} continental shelf (250 m water depth) to water depths of around 800 m. High resistivities (5 - 12 Ωm) observed above the BSR support the presence of gas hydrate in water depths greater than 600 m. High resistivities (3 - 4 Ωm) at 390 - 600 m water depth also suggest possible hydrate occurrence within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) of the continental slope.

40|$|International audienceDeposits of {{pyroclastic}} {{density currents}} (PDCs) often contain accidental lithic clasts of typical size of 0. 1 – 1 m captured from an underlying substrate by the parent flows at distances {{up to several}} tens of kilometers from the eruptive vent. In order to gain insights {{into the nature of}} PDCs, this study investigates the conditions required for entrainment of particles from a granular substrate by a gas–particle density current, with special emphasis to ignimbrite-forming currents whose dynamics are controversial. The two types of physics of emplacement of PDCs proposed in literature are considered. The first model deals with a hydraulically rough, dilute turbulent PDC of bulk density of ∼ 1 – 10 kg/m 3 and considers that entrainment through both traction and saltation is controlled by a Shield criterion at high (> 104) particle Reynolds number. The second model considers entrainment by a PDC consisting of a dense basal flow of bulk density of the order of 103 kg/m 3 and with high interstitial <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure. This model involves uplift of substrate particles, caused by an upward pressure gradient at the flow-substrate interface, and then transport and deposition on the aggrading basal deposit of the flow as demonstrated by recent laboratory experiments. Results show that a dilute PDC can entrain blocks of maximum size of ∼ 10 – 15 cm (for a block density of 2000 – 3000 kg/m 3) if maximum current velocities up to ∼ 100 m/s are taken into account. This, in turn, suggests that larger (heavier) blocks found in deposits were captured by PDCs if these had a dense basal flow. The dense flow model predicts that PDCs have the potential to entrain metric blocks, whose maximum size (up to ∼ 2 – 5 m) decreases with decreasing atmospheric pressure (i. e. increasing altitude). Application of the model considering published data on the characteristics of accidental blocks in several well-studied ignimbrites indicates that the velocity of the parent dense PDCs was up to ∼ 25 – 30 m/s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} a dense {{pyroclastic}} flow to maintain high <b>gas</b> <b>pore</b> pressure, and hence low friction, during runout is determined by (1) the strengths and longevities of gas sources, and (2) {{the ability of the}} material to retain residual gas once those sources become ineffective. The latter is termed the gas retention capacity. Gas retention capacity in a defluidizing granular material is governed by three timescales: one for the evacuation of bubbles (t be; brief and not considered in this paper), one for hindered settling from the expanded state (t sett), and one for diffusive release of residual pore pressure from the non-expanded state (t diff). The relative magnitides of t sett and t diff depend on bed thickness, t sett dominating in thin systems and t diff in thick ones. Three pyroclastic flow materials, two ignimbrites and a block-and-ash flow sample, were studied experimentally to investigate expansion behaviour under gas flow and to determine gas retention times. Effects of particle size were evaluated by using two size cuts (< 4 mm and < 250 μm) from each sample. Careful drying of the materials was necessary to avoid effects of humidity-related cohesion. Two sets of experiments were carried out: (1) expansion in the non-bubbling regime at 50 – 200 °C, (2) bed collapse tests from the initially bubbling state at 50 – 550 °C. Provided that gas channelling was avoided by gentle stirring, all the samples exhibited a regime of uniform expansion prior to the onset of bubbling. Fine particle size (in particular high fines content), low particle density and high temperature all favoured smoother fluidization by increasing the maximum expansion possible in the non-bubbling state. An empirical equation describing the uniform expansion of the materials was determined. High temperature also favoured greater gas partitioning into the dense phase of the bubbling bed, as well (in finer-grained samples) as higher voidage in the settled bed. Large values of t sett and t diff were favoured by fine particle size. Temperature had less influence, suggesting that experimental results at low temperatures (50 – 200 °C) can be extrapolated to higher temperatures. Gas retention times provide insight into the ability of pyroclastic flows in expanded (t sett) or non-expanded (t diff) flow states to retain gas once air ingestion or gas production have become ineffective. Finer-grained pyroclastic flows are expected to retain gas longer, and hence to have higher apparent ‘mobilities', than coarser-grained ones of comparable volume, as has been observed on Montserrat...|$|E

Their working mechanism is based in {{the effect of a}} given target <b>gas</b> in the <b>pores</b> of the slab. The effect pursued is to translate the variation of refraction index of the <b>gas</b> inside the <b>pores</b> into a shift in the position of peaks of transmission associated to resonances in the devicePeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Casting {{defects in}} AlSi 7 Mg alloys are {{owing to the}} {{processing}} technology inseparable features of final products. The porosity consisting of <b>gas</b> <b>pores</b> or microshrinkages is the most decisive factor influencing the fatigue life of castings. Extreme value statistic method has been shown a suitable procedure for prediction of a size of the largest defects, which can occur in real castings, which are substantially larger than the area of a control specimen prepared for defect distribution analysis. In this contribution application of Murakami’s statistical method based on {{the description of the}} largest extreme value distribution to the evaluation of porosity in AlSi 7 Mg alloy prepared by casting technologies with two types of modifiers, namely Sr and Na is presented. The results of statistical analysis are compared with the fatigue performance of specimens manufactured from particular materials...|$|R
40|$|High {{intensity}} synchrotron X-radiation {{has been}} used for video microscopic studies of solidification in Al-Cu alloys. A fast readout low noise detector has allowed imaging with a high spatial and temporal resolution of growing crystals during controlled solidification in a Bridgman furnace. Columnar and equiaxed aluminium dendrites and Al-Cu eutectic growth has been studied systematically as well as formation of defects such as hot tears and <b>gas</b> <b>pores.</b> Dedicated image processing has permitted the extraction of quantitative information on crystal morphology, local growth rate and liquid concentration variations. The results are expected to be valuable for a better understanding of aluminium crystal nucleation and growth and for the validation of crystal growth models. This paper will focus on description of the new technique and give examples of imaging of aluminium dendritic growth, dendrite fragmentation, Al-Cu eutectic growth and porosity formation...|$|R
