5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the land purchase and <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> were permitted separately in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (<b>Extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time)</b> Act, 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E
5|$|To {{make up for}} {{the time}} lost {{following}} the collapse of the L and to restore the BS's finances, the company published a bill in November 1901, which sought another <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and permission to change its funding arrangements. The bill was approved as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1902 on 18 November 1902.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to carry out the works. In July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers alive, the BS announced a new bill in November 1895, which included an application for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The additional time and permission to raise an extra £100,000 of capital was granted when the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896 received royal assent on 7 August 1896.|$|E
5|$|Near Borough station the new tunnels would branch off via a new {{station to}} form an {{interchange}} with the SE and the LB at London Bridge mainline station. The tunnels would then pass {{to the east of}} London Bridge, north through the City of London to Angel. Following a delay, during which a Joint Select Committee reviewed the proposals of several new underground railways, the City and South London Railway Act, 1893 received royal assent on 24 August 1893. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to build the southern extension to Clapham.|$|E

The DR was also to stand guarantor for the W and to lease the W's undertakings, in effect taking over the W This was granted under the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1915 on 24 June 1915. War-time restrictions prevented any construction and so extensions to the earlier acts were granted each year from 1918 to 1922 to give a final date of 26 July 1924 for completion of the compulsory purchase.|$|E
5|$|The {{requested}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{and other}} powers were {{granted by the}} Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act, 1913, given Royal Assent on 15 August 1913. In December 1912, the original promoters were replaced on the W board by UERL nominees and the shares in the company were transferred to the UERL or its shareholders. In late 1913, changes {{were made to the}} track layout at Wimbledon station, including a new platform for use by the W line trains, and land for the junctions with the L mainline was purchased.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another bill {{to increase}} its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE)'s trains to run over the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. Tunnel enlargement works only restarted after World War I when an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> was granted in February 1919.

To avoid the difficulties inherent in the verification <b>of</b> multirate <b>timed</b> automata, we follow the approach suggested in [8]. This approach consists of first transforming the multirate timed automata into timed automata and then applying the symbolic techniques implemented in Kronos.

5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction {{was the end of}} 1896, but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E
5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E
