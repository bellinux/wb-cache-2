5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Baghdadi Jews in India, the Jews {{residing}} in Bombay — the name then used for Mumbai — had settled in the towns of India, living peacefully with other communities in India. Harry <b>D.</b> <b>Wall,</b> in an interview to the New York Times, has said that among the Jews who now remain in Mumbai are a group of Jews known as Bene Jews or Bene Israel who were reportedly descendants of seven tribes of Israel who, in the 2nd century BC, were shipwrecked on India's Konkan coast while escaping persecution in the Galilee. They found that living in India, amidst a cosmopolitan community consisting of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and, much later, Muslims, was a very cordial environment, totally free of anti-Semitic feelings.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{our universe}} as a 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall</b> {{embedded in a}} 5 d dimensional Minkowski space-time. We {{address the problem of}} inflation and late time acceleration driven by bulk particles colliding with the 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall.</b> The expansion of our universe is mainly related to these bulk particles. Since our universe tends to be permeated by a large number of isolated structures, as temperature diminishes with the expansion, we model our universe with a 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall</b> with increasing internal structures. These structures could be unstable 2 <b>d</b> domain <b>walls</b> evolving to fermi-balls which are candidates to cold dark matter. The momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall</b> is related to the reflection coefficient. We show a nontrivial dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark matter structures inside the 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall.</b> As the population of such structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases. The expansion is exponential at early times and polynomial at late times. We connect this picture with string/M-theory by considering BPS 3 <b>d</b> domain <b>walls</b> with structures which can appear through the bosonic sector of a five-dimensional supergravity theory.

40|$|We {{study the}} topologically twisted {{compactification}} of the 6 d (2, 0) M 5 -brane theory on an elliptically fibered Kähler three-fold preserving two supercharges. We show that upon reducing on the elliptic fiber, the 4 d theory is N= 4 Super-Yang Mills, with varying complexified coupling τ, {{in the presence}} of defects. For abelian gauge group this agrees with the so-called duality twisted theory, and we determine a non-abelian generalization to U(N). When the elliptic fibration is singular, the 4 d theory contains 3 <b>d</b> <b>walls</b> (along the branch-cuts of τ) and 2 d surface defects, around which the 4 d theory undergoes SL(2,Z) duality transformations. Such duality defects carry chiral fields, which from the 6 d point of view arise as modes of the two-form B in the tensor multiplet. Each duality defect has a flavor symmetry associated to it, which is encoded {{in the structure of the}} singular elliptic fiber above the defect. Generically 2 d surface defects will intersect in points in 4 d, where there is an enhanced flavor symmetry. The 6 d point of view provides a complete characterization of this 4 d- 3 d- 2 d- 0 d `Matroshka'-defect configuration. Comment: 62 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Heterotic M-Theory is a {{promising}} candidate for that corner of M-theory which makes {{contact with the}} real world. However, while the theory requires one of its expansion parameters, ϵ, to be perturbatively small, a successful phenomenology requires ϵ = O(1). We show that the constraint to have small ϵ is actually unnecessary: instead of the original flux compactification background valid to linear order in ϵ one has to use its appropriate non-linear extension, the exact background solution. The exact background is determined by supersymmetry and consequently one expects the tree-level cosmological constant to vanish which we demonstrate in detail, thereby verifying once more the consistency of this background. Furthermore we show that the exact background represents precisely the 11 d origin of the 5 <b>d</b> domain <b>wall</b> solution which is an exact solution of the effective 5 d heterotic M-theory. We also comment on singularities {{and the issue of}} chirality changing transitions in the exact background. The exact background is then applied to determine Newton's Constant for vacua with an M 5 brane {{on the basis of a}} recent stabilization mechanism for the orbifold length. For vacua without M 5 brane we obtain a correction to the lower bound on Newton's Constant which brings it in perfect agreement with the measured value.

The ground state is a solution of the Euler system which satisfies some explicit additional conditions on the boundary. These conditions are used in a reduction of the system. We construct BKW expansions at all order. The profile problems are linear thanks to a transparency property. We prove the stability of these expansions by proving ε-conormal estimates for a characteristic boundary value problem. 1...|$|R
