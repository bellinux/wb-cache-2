50|$|The {{electrical}} responsive {{materials that}} exist today change {{their size and}} shape depending on the intensity and/or direction of an external electric field. Polyaniline and polypyrrole (PPy) are, in particular, good conducting materials and can be doped with tetrafluoroborate to contract and expand under an electric stimulus. A robot made of these materials was made to move using an electric pulse of 3V for 5 seconds, causing one leg to extend, then removing the stimulus for 10 seconds, causing the other leg to move forward. Research on carbon nanotubes, which are biocompatible and highly conductive, indicates that a composite made of carbon nanotube and a shape memory specimen has a higher electrical conductivity and speed of <b>electro-active</b> response than either specimen alone. Magnetically responsive ferrogels contract {{in the presence of}} a strong magnetic field and thus have applications in drug and cell delivery. The combination of carbon nanotubes and magnetically responsive particles has been bioprinted for use in promoting cell growth and adhesion, while still maintaining a strong conductivity. This is an exciting prospect for 4D printing electrical-magnetic bioinks into precisely engineered structures for biomedical applications, but more research needs to be done on local changes of pH value and temperature of the medium when the stimulus occurs to prevent adverse effects on neighboring cells.|$|E

40|$|Three main {{problems}} have been addressed: universal relations, the modelling of transversely isotropic magneto- and <b>electro-active</b> elastomers, and the variational formulation. The complete setoff linear universal relations was found for isotropic magneto- and <b>electro-active</b> elastomers. Some universal relations for some special simplified cases of the constitutive equations were also found. Two non-linear universal relations were studied, for the helical shear and for the anti-plane shear deformations. Two boundary value problems were solved using the finite difference method: {{one of them was}} the inflation and extension of a tube of finite length under the influence of a uniform axial magnetic field applied far away, and the other was the uniform extension of a cylinder with an electric field applied far away. The constitutive equations for transversely isotropic magneto- and <b>electro-active</b> elastomers were developed, and several simple boundary value problems were solved. For the case of transversely isotropic magneto-active elastomers a preliminary form for the energy function was proposed.

40|$|Porous metals have {{recently}} {{attracted much attention}} in both academia and industry. They have many potential applications ranging from light weight structure, thermal management and sound absorption, because of their unique structural, mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties. Open-cell porous metal can be an ideal material for electrochemical applications due to its high surface area, permeability and electric conductivity. The <b>electro-active</b> surface area of porous electrodes {{is the most important}} factor in electrochemical applications, such as fuel cells, because it largely determines the current density in the electrode. However, most research to date on the surface area of porous metals has been focused on the geometric and real surface areas. Very little research has been conducted to study the <b>electro-active</b> surface area. The mass transfer coefficient of a solid electrode is a very important factor in flow cell applications, such as flow battery and wastewater treatment, because high mass transfer coefficient means high reaction performance. However, very little research has been carried out on the mass transfer coefficient of open-cell porous metal manufactured by the space-holder method. The main objective of this study is to investigate the electrochemically relevant structural properties of porous Cu and Ni fabricated by the Lost Carbonate Sintering (LCS) process, which is a cost-effective process for manufacturing open-cell porous metals with controlled porosity, pore size and pore shape. In this project, the geometric, <b>electro-active</b> and real surface areas of porous Cu and Ni have been measured by quantitative stereology, cyclic voltammetry (peak current) and cyclic voltammetry (double layer capacitance) methods, respectively. The mass transfer coefficient of porous Ni has been measured by linear sweep voltammetry, using a purpose-built flow cell. The tortuosity of porous Cu has been measured by a diffusion method, using a purpose-built diaphragm cell. The geometric, <b>electro-active</b> and real surface areas of porous metal are due to the contributions from the primary porosity, the primary and secondary porosities, and the surfaces of metal particles, respectively. The geometric, <b>electro-active</b> and real surface areas of porous Cu and Ni samples with pore sizes 75 - 1500 µm and porosities 0. 53 - 0. 81 were in the ranges of 18 - 110 cm- 1, 24 - 369 cm- 1 and 700 - 1200 cm- 1, respectively. Both the geometric and <b>electro-active</b> surface area increased with porosity and decreased with pore size. The real surface area decreased with porosity but the effect of pore size was not pronounced. The values of <b>electro-active</b> surface area of LCS porous metal can be similar to and often greater than those of the existing porous metals, e. g. incofoam Ni. The mass transfer coefficient of porous Ni with pore sizes 250 - 1500 µm and porosities 0. 63 - 0. 81 at different flow rates from 0. 24 ml/s to 2. 8 ml/s was in the range of 0. 0035 - 0. 0727 cm/s. Both the limiting current and mass transfer coefficient increased with flow rate and had the maximum values at a porosity of around 0. 65 - 0. 70. The maximum limiting current decreased and the maximum mass transfer coefficient increased with pore size. Compared with a smooth Ni plate at the same flow velocity, the mass transfer coefficient of the LCS porous Ni was increased by up to 9 times. The enhancement is due to the Ni particles providing a rough surface for the cell walls and the tortuous pore structure resulting in a high level of fluid turbulence. The tortuosity of the porous Cu samples, with pore sizes 250 - 1500 µm and porosities 0. 56 - 0. 84, was in the range of 1. 33 - 1. 78. It increased with pore size and decreased with porosity, agreeing with an empirical formula for porous media. This research has successfully applied cyclic voltammetry to the measurement of <b>electro-active</b> surface area of porous metals for the first time. It is the first systematic study of the structural properties of relevance to electrochemical applications of porous metals manufactured by LCS process...|$|E

In this research, two hybrid nanocomposite materials, gold-cobalt oxide nanowires and ferrocene functional polymer brushes on electrode surface, were investigated. Polymerizations of magnetic colloidal monomers to form <b>electro-active</b> nanowires and ferrocene functional monomers on electrode to form <b>electro-active</b> polymer brushes were demonstrated. The {{central focus of}} this research is utilizing colloidal polymerization and surface-initiated polymerization to prepare <b>electro-active</b> hybrid nanocomposite materials for potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Colloidal polymerization has been developed as a novel synthetic methodology to prepare 1 -D mesostructures via dipolar assembly and chemical reaction. This method was exploited to synthesize multicomponent 1 -D nanowires by using polymer-coated ferromagnetic gold-cobalt core-shell nanoparticles as colloidal monomers. Prepared semiconductor cobalt oxide nanowires with gold inclusions exhibited enhanced optical and electrochemical properties compared to cobalt oxide nanowires. This research provided a platform in fabricating a wide range multicomponent semiconductor nanowires as new nanostructured electrodes for potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Further, self-assembled gold-cobalt core-shell nanoparticles were utilized to align novel gold nanoparticles on a substrate. This facile and template free approach enabled the linear and ring assembly of noble gold metal on a substrate. Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films are key components as transparent electrodes in a number of optoelectronic devices. The modification of ITO surfaces with polymers via electropolymerization has been widely investigated to improve surface compatibility and charge injection from the interface. However, there remain challenges to prepare polymers possessing, well-defined interfacial chemistry, molecular weight, composition, and functionality. This dissertation provides a modular synthetic methodology to prepare ferrocene functional polymer brushes on ITO via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). This work provided a simple model study to enable direct electrochemical and topographic characterization of well-defined polymer brushes on ITO with controlled molar mass and composition. These ITO grafted polymer brushes are also a novel model system for optoelectronic materials, where the effect of chain alignment and morphology can be correlated with electrical and electrochemical properties...|$|E

Addition of BiVO 4 produces up to 98 % of <b>electro-active</b> phases. Robust electrostatic interactions arise between charges at the BiVO 4 -surfaces, and differences in electron affinity between CH 2 and CF 2 groups created dielectric dipoles.

Experiments performed in MFC set-ups were compared with electrochemical cells under polarization at + 0. 1 V versus SCE. Different parameters were tested to optimize the microbial anode. Preliminary acclimation of the compost microbial flora to YW was revealed to be unnecessary. Forming biofilms firstly in pure leachate before exposing them to YW showed that high concentrations of this type of substrate were detrimental to current generation.

40|$|<b>Electro-active</b> organic {{materials}} have received considerable {{attention in the}} emerging area of molecular electronics and nanotechnology {{not only because of}} the attractive optical and electronic properties but also the advantages of {{organic materials}} such as low cost, easy processing, and great opportunities for structural modification. These materials are now being considered as active components in electronic and optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes for display applications, thin film transistors for low-cost and ultra-dense logic and memory circuits, photodiodes for optical information processing, and photovoltaic cells for solar energy harvesting. Therefore the <b>electro-active</b> organic materials have become a focus of intense research. This thesis concentrates the synthesis and study of optoelectronic properties of several classes of novel <b>electro-active</b> organic materials. A series of <b>electro-active</b> tetraarylbenzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b¡¦]difuran (BDF) and model diarylbenzofuran derivatives have been synthesized and their structures were established by X-ray crystallography. The single charge stabilization by benzodifuran and coplanar fÑ-aryl groups lying on the longitudinal suggests that the linear arrays of BDFs may allow the construction of molecular wires suitable for long-range electron transport. The synthesis of hexa alkyloxy substituted hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC), a larger and eletron rich chromophore, via oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of hexakis(4 -alkyloxyphenyl) -benzene produced a quantitative yield of an indenofluorene derivative rather than the expected HBC. The mechanistic considerations for the formation of the indenofluorene derivative led us to devise an alternative synthesis of elusive alkoxy-substituted HBC. Furthermore a series of alkyloxy substituted HBCs were prepared and their electronic properties were studied. A series of aryloxy-substituted tetraphenylethylenes (TPEs), tetraphenylethylene based dendrimers and a series of phenyl ethers were prepared and the effect of the diarylether linkage on their electronic and optical properties was studied. Although the diarylether linkage in TPEs did not affect the properties significantly, these linkages in poly-p-phenyl ethers seem to mediate the delocalization of the cationic charges. A series of cycloannulated aromatic donors were prepared for the preparation of stable cation radical salts. The availability of wide range of donors with varied redox potentials (0. 82 V- 1. 85 V) and spectroscopic features make these cation radicals to be valuable oxidants for variety of organic, inorganic and organometallic donors...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{influence}} of an electric field, ionic <b>electro-active</b> polymers generally bend or deswell, depending on {{the shape of the}} polymer matrices and its position relative to the electrodes. In this study, we investigate the bending behaviour of regenerated cellulose-based ionic <b>electro-active</b> composites for the fabrication of soft actuators with improved actuation force and durability. This research also focuses on the externally induced (electrically and magnetically) matrices deswelling and other responses, which affect the release of drug from the matrices. For actuation studies, we prepared matrices by combining carbon nanofibers, conducting polymers, and ionic liquids (through blending, doping, or coating) into the regenerated cellulose. We observed that actuators coated by polypyrrole doped with anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate showed improved electrical conductivity and durability compared to that of using perchlorate ion as the dopant. This is due to the preparation process and the effect of dopants that play an important role to improve the performance of the regenerated cellulose-based ionic <b>electro-active</b> actuators. In addition, we investigated {{the influence}} of electrode design (layer-by-layer structure) on the properties of the actuators. Further, in this study, we developed three types of matrices consisting of regenerated cellulose/functionalized carbon nanofibers, regenerated cellulose/functionalized carbon nanofibers/polypyrrole, and regenerated cellulose/γ-ferric oxide/polypyrrole. We investigated the effects of electric field strength and electrode polarity on the release rate of sulfosalicylic acid (drug) in an acetate buffer solution with pH 5. 5 and temperature 37 ᵒC during a period of 5 h. Drug release rate from the matrices containing carbon nanofibers (additives) increased effectively with increasing applied electric field. The mechanism of drug release from drug-doped polypyrrole coated matrices includes expansion of conductive polymer chain and the electrostatic force between electron and drug. The novelty of the work is- the matrices can also work under magnetic field and consequently, one can be beneficial from a contactless actuation. In this study, we also investigated electrical conductivity, morphology, swelling behaviour of the composite matrices, <b>electro-active</b> composite-drug interaction, and in vitro drug release behaviour of the matrices. Further, a comparative study was performed on the rate of drug release from the matrices induced by electric and magnetic field...|$|E

We studied {{the dependence of}} the E-J characteristics on the aggregate content in the polymer matrix. Formulations with 35 vol. % MOV aggregates in the 200 - 375 µm range exhibit reliable nonlinear behavior with a switching voltage of 175 ± 30 V/mm. This opens a way to valorize varistors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) ceramics...|$|E
