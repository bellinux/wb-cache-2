Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a strobe lamp. The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (θs), spray width (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> Quantitative analysis of the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which promotes the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface.

40|$|A smooth {{circular}} moving <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is formed}} by the head-on impingement of two equal laminar water jets. We subject such a <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> to uniform laminar air flow from one side such that the direction of air velocity is perpendicular to the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> The pressure of the moving air deforms the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> giving rise to an open water bell. The water bell is symmetric suggesting that the gas flow around the bell is also symmetric and that the gravitational force is negligible. We have captured {{the shape of the}} water bells for varying air flow rates and for varying Weber numbers, and compared the measurements with theoretical predictions obtained from a force balance involving liquid inertia, surface tension, and pressure difference across the sheet. The pressure exerted by the gas phase on the front and the rear surface of the deformed <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> is obtained from known results of flow past flat circular discs. The predicted steady state shapes match well with the measurements at low Weber numbers but differences are observed at high Weber numbers, where the sheet flaps and is no longer smooth. Interestingly, the shape predicted by assuming a constant pressure difference equal to the stagnation pressure over the whole of the front face of the sheet and free stream value over the whole of the rear face yields nearly identical results suggesting that an open water bell is similar to a closed water bell in that, to a good approximation, the pressure on either sides of the water bell is homogeneous.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thickness measurement of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> spray. Two types of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> spray were measured, i. e. the wall impingement spray and flat spray. The measurement {{was carried out}} by a light absorption method using He-Cd laser and diode laser. Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus in this study. Moreover, the thickness change of the flat spray prior to the breakup point was further clarified from the movement of 4 -points of photochromic dye traces by using laser tagging method (See Fig. 2). In other words, the thickness data both from the light absorption method and laser tagging method was compared to clarify the characteristics of the breakup phenomena of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> As can be seen in Fig. 3, there were two kinds of thickness change for both sprays. The first one shows the decreasing trend up until the breakup point. Another kind of change was the increasing trends of the thickness after having the decreasing trend. The reason for these phenomena {{can be attributed to the}} ligament formation in the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> as shown in the Fig. 4. In other words, the increasing trend re{{presents the}} moment when the 4 -points of dye traces accumulated into the ligament, while the decreasing trends indicates the moment when the dye traces were located in between two ligaments. Therefore, the change of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness between two ligaments can be clarified by the laser tagging method, which is normally difficult to be achieved by using the light absorption method...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{thin sheet}} flows has {{recently}} been renewed due to their potential application in space radiators. Theoretical and experimental studies of the fluid dynamics and stability of thin <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> flows {{have been carried out}} in this thesis. A computer program was developed to determine the cross-sectional shape of the edge cylinder given the cross-sectional area of the edge cylinder. A stability analysis was performed on a non-planer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> A study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} air resistance on the sheet...|$|R
40|$|Atomization {{caused by}} {{impinging}} two liquid jets {{at an angle}} was studied experimentally and analytically. Measurements of drop size, sheet length and width at breakup, and apparent wave structures on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> surface were made for different flow conditions and different geometries. The breakup of the attenuating <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> into ligaments was modeled by linear stability theory. Breakup lengths were predicted from the fastest growing wave on the sheet surface, and drop diameters were calculated based on surface tension-controlled breakup of the ligaments...|$|R
40|$|A recent theory [M. S. Tirumkudulu and M. Paramati, "Stability of {{a moving}} radial liquid sheet: Time {{dependent}} equations," Phys. Fluids 25 (10), 102 - 107 (2013) ] {{has shown that}} a radially expanding <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> is unstable to sinuous wave disturbances due to the thinning of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> while ignoring {{the presence of a}} surrounding gas phase. In this work, we compare the predictions of the aforementioned theory with the measurements of Crapper et al. ["Large amplitude Kelvin-Helmholtz waves on thin liquid sheets," Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 342 (1629), 209 - 224 (1975) ] who measured the amplitude and spatial growth rates of sinuous waves induced in radially expanding <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> produced by fan spray nozzles. The predicted growth rates are remarkably close to the measurements over a range of forcing frequencies and amplitudes even though the experiments were performed {{in the presence of a}} surrounding gas phase. This is in contrast to large discrepancies observed by Crapper et al. when the same measurements were compared with the predictions of a spatial stability analysis for a moving <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> that accounts for the inertia of the surrounding gas phase but ignores the thickness variation of the sheet.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} global {{dynamics of}} a gravitational <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> interacting with a onesided adjacent air enclosure, typically {{referred to as}} nappe oscillation, is addressed, under the assumptions of potential flow and presence of surface tension effects. Preliminary physical insights of the sheet centerline sinuous modes show that the nappe dynamics features the propagation of two wave fronts both directed downstream or one downstream {{and the other one}} upstream depending on whether the flow Weber number is greater or less than unity, respectively; moreover, the overall system behaves as a driven damped spring-mass oscillator, where the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> acts as the mass and the air enclosure as the spring. The findings of the eigenvalues spectral analysis closely agree with direct numerical simulations of the partial differential equation governing in the space-time domain the global evolution of the disturbances, starting from an initial gaussian-like shape.
