40|$|Software {{complexity}} {{has always}} been an issue in software development, especially for larger system with innovative functionalities. One solution to reduce the problem of software complexity is by applying software reuse method. Nowadays, Software Product Line is an emerging paradigm for handling software development for software reuse. Software Product Line usually associated with using feature-oriented development methods. Although there are many methods that existed for developing Software Product Line, there are no concrete descriptions on systematic processes that the methods used. Therefore, in this research, an integration of three feature-oriented Software Product Line methods is proposed for developing software architecture. The methods are Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA), Feature-Architecture Mapping (FArM), and Feature Dependency Analysis (FDA). The case study selected for this research is Precision Farming application based on Wireless Sensor Network. The proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>method</b> provides systematic processes with detailed guidelines for designing software architecture. The software architecture for the case study is developed using the proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>method.</b> The proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>method</b> is evaluated with the initial FArM and has higher benefits because the <b>integrated</b> <b>method</b> includes domain analysis and enhanced mechanism for handling feature dependencies.

This study investigated the frequency and intensity of conflicts, using five conflict centers, on projects executed with either the <b>integrated</b> or traditional <b>method</b> in Nigeria. Questionnaires were administered through purposive and snowballing techniques on 274 projects located in twelve states of Nigeria and Abuja. 94 usable responses were obtained. The collected data were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. In projects procured with traditional methods, conflicts relating to resources for project execution had the greatest frequency, while conflicts around project/client goals had the least frequency. For projects executed with <b>integrated</b> <b>methods,</b> conflicts due to administrative procedures were ranked highest while conflicts due to project/client goals were ranked least.

In the recent years, medical education highly changes through new education methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare medical students’ satisfaction in traditional and <b>integrated</b> <b>methods</b> of teaching physiology course. Instrument and Methods: In the descriptive analysis study, fifty 4 th semester medical students of Bojnourd University of Medical Sciences were studied in 2015. The subjects were randomly selected based on availability. Data was collected by two researcher-made questionnaires; their validity and reliability were confirmed. Questionnaure 1 was completed by the students after presenting renal and endocrinology topics via traditional and <b>integrated</b> <b>methods.</b> Questionnaire 2 was only completed by the students after presenting the course via <b>integrated</b> <b>method.</b> Data was analyzed by SPSS 16 software using dependent T test. Findings: Mean score of the students’ satisfaction in traditional method (24. 80 ± 3. 48) was higher than <b>integrated</b> <b>method</b> (22. 30 ± 4. 03; p< 0. 0001).

30|$|This paper proposes an {{innovative}} procedure of finding efficient facility location–allocation (FLA) schemes, integrating {{data envelopment analysis}} (DEA) and a multi-objective programming (MOP) model methodology.

The procedure requires that conflicting performance measures classified as inputs to be minimized, or outputs to be maximized. Solving an MOP problem generates diverse alternative FLA schemes along with multi-objective values. DEA evaluates these schemes to generate a relative efficiency score for each scheme. Then, using stratification DEA, all of these FLA schemes are stratified into several levels, from the most efficient to the most inefficient levels. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed <b>integrating</b> <b>method.</b> We observe that the combined approach in this paper performs well and would provide many insights to academians as well as practitioners and researchers.|$|E
