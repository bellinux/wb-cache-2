5|$|Charles E. Barber {{was born}} in London in 1840. His grandfather, John Barber, led the family to America in the early 1850s. Both John and his son William were {{engravers}} and Charles followed in their footsteps. The Barber family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States, though they later moved to Providence to allow William {{to work for the}} Gorham Manufacturing Company. William Barber's skills {{came to the attention of}} Mint Chief <b>Engraver</b> James B. Longacre, who hired him as an assistant <b>engraver</b> in 1865; when Longacre died in 1869, William Barber became chief <b>engraver</b> and Charles was hired as an assistant <b>engraver.</b>|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the {{production}} of elongated coins, various methods have been used to <b>engrave</b> the design into the roller.

5|$|The Metamorphoses of Ovid {{has been}} {{illustrated}} by several artists through time. In 1563 in Frankfurt, a German bilingual translation by Johann Posthius was published, featuring the woodcuts of renowned German <b>engraver</b> Virgil Solis. The illustration of Myrrha depicts Myrrha's deceiving her father {{as well as}} her fleeing from him. In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of Metamorphoses was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French <b>engraver</b> Bernard Picart. The illustration of Myrrha was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French <b>engraver</b> Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.|$|E
5|$|Creating the {{new design}} was the {{responsibility}} of Chief <b>Engraver</b> John R. Sinnock, {{who had been in}} his position since 1925. Much of the work in preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief <b>engraver</b> Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the <b>engraver</b> of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the <b>engraver</b> had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E

5|$|In post-classical times, Myrrha has had {{widespread}} {{influence in}} Western culture. She was {{mentioned in the}} Divine Comedy by Dante, was an inspiration for Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri, and was alluded to in Mathilda by Mary Shelley. In the play Sardanapalus by Byron, a character named Myrrha appeared, whom critics interpreted {{as a symbol of}} Byron's dream of romantic love. The myth of Myrrha was one of 24 tales retold in Tales from Ovid by English poet Ted Hughes. In art, Myrrha's seduction of her father has been illustrated by German <b>engraver</b> Virgil Solis, her tree-metamorphosis by French <b>engraver</b> Bernard Picart and Italian painter Marcantonio Franceschini, while French <b>engraver</b> Gustave Doré chose to depict Myrrha in Hell as a part of his series of engravings for Dante's Divine Comedy. In music, she has appeared in pieces by Sousa and Ravel. She was also the inspiration for several species' scientific names and an asteroid.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to the feeling that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief <b>engraver</b> (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and <b>engraver</b> to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.|$|E

5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the <b>engraver</b> sketched out a peer's helmet on the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the <b>engraver</b> was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|William Barber died August 31, 1879 of {{an illness}} {{contracted}} after swimming at Atlantic City, New Jersey. His son {{applied for the}} position of chief <b>engraver,</b> as did George T.

Loudon Snowden met to determine the issue. They decided to recommend the appointment of Barber, who was subsequently nominated by President Rutherford B. Hayes and in February 1880, was confirmed by the Senate. Barber would serve nine presidents in the position, remaining {{until his death in}} 1917, when Morgan would succeed him.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{introduces the}} basic techniques for digital facial <b>engraving,</b> which imitates traditional copperplate <b>engraving.</b> Inspired by traditional techniques, we first establish {{a set of}} basic rules thanks to which separate <b>engraving</b> layers are built {{on the top of}} the original photo. Separate layers are merged according to simple merging rules and according to range shift/scale masks specially introduced for this purpose. We illustrate the introduced technique by a set of black/white and color engravings, showing different features such as engraving-specific image enhancements, mixing different regular <b>engraving</b> lines with mezzotint, irregular perturbations of <b>engraving</b> lines etc. We introduce the notion of <b>engraving</b> style which comprises a set of separate <b>engraving</b> layers together with a set of associated range shift/scale masks. The <b>engraving</b> style helps to port the look and feel of one <b>engraving</b> to another. Once different libraries of pre-defined mappable <b>engraving</b> styles and an appropriate user interface are added to the basic system, producing a decent gravure starting from a simple digital photo will be a matter of seconds. The <b>engraving</b> technique described in this contribution opens new perspectives for digital art, adding unprecedented power and precision to the engraver’s work...|$|R

5|$|For Mint Chief <b>Engraver</b> Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant <b>engraver</b> at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief <b>engraver</b> was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E
