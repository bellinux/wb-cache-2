5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E
5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of PÃ³voa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.|$|E
25|$|Fishing is {{an ancient}} {{practice}} {{that dates back to}} at least the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago. Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. Archaeology features such as shell middens, <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> bones, and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the bulb}} {{protrudes}} past {{the leading edge}} of the keel, it is called a [...] "T-bulb". It offers better performance (like required for racing), but is prone to hook into flotsam (like kelp or <b>discarded</b> <b>fishing</b> nets).|$|R
25|$|There was a {{measurable}} increase in discarding {{immediately following the}} introduction of the ITQ system, despite the fact that fishermen were offered 10% of the market price for fish landed outside quota. In an attempt to address this change, the New Zealand Government increased the percentage of market price paid to 50%. The balance between offering an incentive to land <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> and the disincentive to catch fish over or outside quota limits is clearly a fine one, and dependent on the financial reward or penalty attached.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
25|$|The harvesting, processing, and {{consuming}} of seafoods are ancient {{practices with}} archaeological evidence dating back {{well into the}} Paleolithic. Findings in a sea cave at Pinnacle Point in South Africa indicate Homo sapiens (modern humans) harvested marine life as early as 165,000 years ago, while the Neanderthals, an extinct human species contemporary with early Homo sapiens, {{appear to have been}} eating seafood at sites along the Mediterranean coast beginning around the same time. Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. Archaeology features such as shell middens, <b>discarded</b> <b>fish</b> bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.|$|E

This report, undertaken by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), reviews the magnitude and composition of ALDFG, and while noting that information is not comprehensive and does not allow for any global estimates, suggests that gillnets and fishing traps/pots may be {{the most common type of}} ALDFG.

40|$|Fish {{species in}} catch and discard of trawl {{fisheries}} {{in and around}} Iskenderun Bay were examined within the fishing closure period and fishing period. The sampling was performed from May 2010 to January 2011 by a commercial trawl vessel. Chondricthyan species accounted for 51 % of discard catch biomass while Gymnura altavela and Dasyatis pastinaca were dominant in hauls. 27 lessepsian fish species were captured during the study, nine of them being target species for trawl fisheries. In total, 14 of the lessepsian fish species were determined as discard species. In both sampling periods, Equulites klunzingeri and Citharus linguatula contributed to <b>discard</b> <b>fish</b> catch dissimilarity among depth ranges (deeper and shallower than 60 m). E. klunzingeri showed high abundance in discard catch. There {{were no significant differences}} in the distribution of the <b>discard</b> <b>fish</b> biomass between the sampling periods (ANOVA test, p> 0. 05). However, depth range highlighted significant differences in <b>discard</b> <b>fish</b> catch composition (p< 0. 05). Among major commercial fish species of trawl fisheries, Mullus surmuletus and Sparus aurata were not separated as discard in any haul by fishermen.

50|$|ITQs {{may have}} the effect of {{changing}} the criteria that fishermen apply to their catch. Highgrading involves catching more fish than the quota allows and dumping specimens that are less valuable because of size, age or other criteria.

50|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} wild fish killed each year is estimated as 0.97-2.74 trillion (based on FAO tonnage statistics combined with estimated mean weights of fish species).

5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and <b>discarded</b> <b>fishing</b> lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death.

The performance has been proved through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study. The results from the LCA study are compared with the production of virgin materials. The results of the LCA show that especially the carbon footprint is remarkable better for Oceanix than for virgin plastics. Oceanix HDPE is 5 times better than virgin HDPE, when talking about the carbon foot print, and the results for Oceanix PP and Oceanix PA 6 are 5 times and 20 times better compared with virgin PP and PA 6. Also other environmental indicators are better for Oceanix compared with virgin plastics...|$|R
