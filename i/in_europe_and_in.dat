5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E

In the 1990s Italian auto industry became again 3rd <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> 5th <b>in</b> World with annual output more than 2 million.

5|$|Processed {{pizza cheese}} is {{manufactured}} to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year.

Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent {{the bulk of his}} time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the Arab world.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Antiquary, A {{journal of}} oriental {{research}} in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, , , (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It {{was founded by}} the archaeologist James Burgess to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts {{that in many cases}} remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian folklore and folktales. It was succeeded by The New Indian Antiquary (1938-47) and the Indian Antiquary (1964-71).|$|E

5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} a formality until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Grainger {{moved to}} the United States, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life, though he {{travelled}} widely <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922 he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines that he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works and as a future research archive. As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity, and he considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E
5|$|The British {{army was}} {{defeated}} by an army {{under the direction of}} Santiago de Liniers, and Spanish authority was restored. It was expected that the British would return, and the whole city started to prepare for that possibility. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires after the reconquest, and put himself under the command of Liniers. He was appointed sergeant of the Patricians Regiment, under the command of Cornelio Saavedra, and started to study military strategy. After some conflicts with other officials, he resigned as sergeant and served again under the command of Liniers. A new British attack took place in July 1807. During the battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by Balbiani. After a successful resistance against the British, Belgrano resumed his work in the Consulate and discontinued his military studies. Because of his knowledge of French he had a brief interview with the defeated Robert Craufurd, who proposed British support for an independentist movement. Belgrano rejected the offer, considering that Britain would readily remove their support if they had a more lucrative option <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> such case the revolutionaries would be helpless against a Spanish counterattack.|$|E
