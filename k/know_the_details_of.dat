Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> each and every application and its protocol.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a formula centred around V8-engined Fords and Holdens for the Australian Touring Car Championship had been {{established}} as early as mid-1991. With the new regulations set to come into effect in 1993, Ford and Holden were both keen to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the new formula {{by the end of}} 1991, putting pressure on the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) to provide clarity on the matter. However, CAMS was waiting to see what the FIA did with its proposed international formula for 2.5 and 2.0-litre touring cars.|$|E
25|$|Padmavati, though {{initially}} dejected by her husband's departure, soon {{falls into}} the company of wanton women who suggest that she take on a lover. She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the investigation.|$|E

The interrogators question him on [...] "Sugarhorse." [...] Lucas relays this to Harry, who claims not knowing what Sugarhorse is. However, he later visits a retired spycatcher Bernard Qualtrough (Richard Johnson) believing there is high level mole within MI5. He only reveals that Sugarhorse is MI5's [...] "best kept secret" [...] that only five people, including Richard Dolby (Robert East), the Director General, and himself, <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of.</b> Harry later returns to Qualtrough's bookstore {{to find out who}} the mole might be, starting by looking into Dolby's file.|$|E

[...] It was soon revealed that the Zeng Jia Township had failed to reach its enforcement quotas under the one-child policy for the past two years, so it had received a [...] "yellow card" [...] warning. [...] Desiring to remove the warning, town officials decided to crack down on enforcement in June 2012.|$|E
500|$|French {{ambassador}} Stanislas Ostroróg {{was involved}} in returning {{the remains of the}} Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; {{in a letter to the}} European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris [...] "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. [...] Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. [...] He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." [...] Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. [...] "Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased." [...] per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors.|$|E

2500|$|Atwater {{had urged}} the Court {{to adopt a}} [...] "bright-line" [...] rule that the police not arrest anyone for an offense that did not carry jail time unless the {{government}} could show a compelling need to detain the person. [...] At first blush, the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules {{that are easy to}} apply on the spot. [...] But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. [...] Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> [...] "frequently complex penalty schemes," [...] especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs. [...] Furthermore, even if the officer could make that distinction on the spot, he could not know how the district attorney will later choose to charge the offense.|$|E
