5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train <b>door</b> <b>window</b> to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E

25|$|Earl A. Young (born March 31, 1889 – May 24, 1975) was an American architect, realtor and {{insurance}} agent. Over {{a span of}} 52 years, he designed and built 31 structures in Charlevoix, Michigan but was never a registered architect. He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are {{commonly referred to as}} gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His <b>door,</b> <b>window,</b> roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young's goal was to show that a small stone house could be as impressive as a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today.|$|E

2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the <b>door</b> <b>window</b> panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E
2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the drivers <b>door</b> <b>window.</b> Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|E
2500|$|Poor {{construction}} {{quality was}} apparent {{even in the}} company's press department fleet. The British magazine Motor published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover's general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the rear <b>door</b> <b>window</b> frame's edge {{on the left side}} of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car's front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the ventilation outlet directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of fresh air through the vent in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain's Autocar was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was [...] "the best car he [...] ever had", both for its many qualities as a driver's car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.|$|E

2500|$|The debut {{episode of}} EastEnders {{began with the}} {{discovery}} of elderly resident Reg Cox's dead body, following his murder by Nick. Holland and Smith wanted to introduce the series in a dramatic fashion, and believed the Reg Cox storyline to be a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder. Santer has explained that Nick was established as a [...] "kind of spitting, snarling beast right from the outset", {{with the end of the}} first episode seeing Nick granted EastEnders first drum roll ending as he punched through the glass <b>door</b> <b>window</b> of The Queen Victoria pub after a fight with Ali Osman. After a few weeks of the police investigation, prime suspect Nick left the Square, and in April it was reported that he had been arrested. After Nick's mother, Dot, was introduced to the cast in July, she informed the audience that Nick had managed to get off on probation, and the following month, he returned to Albert Square. Upon his return, he broke into Harold Legg's surgery and came across Kathy Beale's medical records, discovering she had a child at 14 years old. Nick threatens to reveal this to Kathy's husband, Pete unless she gives him regular payments. Kathy soon tells Pete the truth, resulting in him giving Nick a beating in the middle of the street. Following this, Den warns Nick to leave the square for good, with the exception of visiting Dot occasionally, or he will face fatal consequences.|$|E
2500|$|For 1977 the Thunderbird was {{shifted to}} the smaller [...] {{wheelbase}} chassis that underpinned the 1972–76 Ford Torino and its replacement, the LTD II which also debuted for 1977. Even with the nearly 8 inches in length from the 1975 Thunderbird (only 1.2 inches 217.7 vs 218.9 from the 2nd model year 1973 of 6th generation) it still looked large to the eye. It was not till the next generation 1980 model {{that it had a}} dramatic downsize of 17.3 inches from 217.7 to 200.4 inches in length]. In 1977, Thunderbird outsold the Oldsmobile Cutlass to become America's top selling personal luxury sedan. It was Ford's first effort at downsizing the Thunderbird, reflecting rising demand for more fuel efficient cars. In essence, this generation was a continuation of the 1974–76 Ford Elite, Ford's first attempt at competing in the market created by the Pontiac Grand Prix and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Compared to the previous generation Thunderbird, the new car lost nearly 8 inches of overall length at 217.7 and [...] of weight, although height and width were relatively unchanged. A substantial component of the weight reduction was in the drivetrain, where a small-block V8 replaced the heavier big-block V8s of previous years and proved to be an outstanding performer. The standard engine outside California was the [...] Windsor V8, while the larger [...] 351M and [...] and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was required, and the 400 optionally available. For the first time, a wide fixed [...] "B" [...] pillar was used, reflecting Detroit's abandonment of pillarless hardtops in the mid- and late-1970s. However, the <b>door</b> <b>window</b> glass remained frameless.|$|E
2500|$|Both VAM {{versions}} incorporated manual front disk brakes, front sway bar, floor-mounted three-speed manual transmissions, a 3.31:1 rear {{differential gear}} ratio, and the [...] I6 engine with a Carter YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft and 8.0:1 compression ratio rated at [...] at 3900rpm. Both versions were {{equipped with a}} 140km/h / 90mph speedometer, individual fold-down front seats, three-point seat belts, parcel shelf, front and rear ashtrays, cigarette lighter, locking glove-box, padded sun visors, carpeting, round dome light, inside hood release, rear spoiler, AM radio and antenna. The Gremlin X model included a Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, power steering, bumper guards, wheel trim rings, narrow longer volcano hubcaps, blacked out side glass and <b>door</b> <b>window</b> frames, wider 70X14 radial tires, front fender [...] "4.2 Litros" [...] decals, a sports grille designed by VAM, tinted windshield, AMC's three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a VAM logo on the horn button, light group (lighter, glove box, courtesy and hood), bright molding package (rocker panels, wheel lips and drip rails), digital tachometer and retractable three-point seatbelts instead of the non-retractable fixed units. Door panels were the same in both versions except that the X had lower carpet inserts and map pouches. The roof rack that was standard on the base model was optional on the X version. The heater was optional on the base Gremlin with manual transmission and standard for other versions. The base Gremlin had few options, while the Gremlin X offered a greater list. The base model offered bumper guards, power steering, light group, bright molding package, tinted windshield, sports steering wheel and wheel trim rings. The X versions could be ordered with air conditioning, reading dome light, AM/FM radio, rear defogger, and sunroof. Options shared by both versions were limited to a TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, power brakes, passenger's side remote mirror, and dual remote controlled mirrors.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Robert Niosi, Sally Lee, and their family, and Niosi undertook a major renovation of the home: he expanded the kitchen and changed {{the door to the}} servants' quarters into a bookshelf. He also renovated the master bedroom upstairs but left the circular windows alone, expanding the front <b>door</b> <b>window</b> to let more light into the front hallway, and he copper-paneled the front Dutch-style door. In addition, the outdated boiler system was replaced, and the entrance to the living room was widened. Niosi left the exterior relatively unchanged, but he said that when he bought the house, it was very [...] "austere" [...] inside—the walls were simple white or beige in color, with no ornamentation; the only decoration was on the unique Harrison-designed spiral staircase to the second floor, which had brass bamboo supports that Niosi left alone; he stated that the staircase had been built in Japan and exported in one piece. Niosi had previously lived in a Victorian apartment, decorated both inside and out, so when he moved to this Harrison-designed house, it was initially cold and unwelcoming with its simplicity and lack of decoration. To address this, Niosi added more traditional 1930s Mackintosh Arts and Crafts interior wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper in order to decorate and soften the interior of the house and make it more warm and inviting. This redecoration gave this residence a unique combination of a conventional 1930s Arts and Crafts interior design with an unconventional early Modernist exterior. He also had many walls and doors removed that were deemed unnecessary, and raised ceilings and added windows. The house's kitchen, with an adjoining maid's room and bathroom, was replaced with a modern kitchen. The living room was split to include a home theater and the wet bar was replaced to accommodate a film collection. After the remodel, parts of the house were featured in Ladies' Home Journal and Parents.|$|E
