40|$|Most people {{consider}} a database {{is merely a}} data repository that supports data storage and retrieval. Actually, a database contains rich, inter-related, multi-typed data and information, forming one or a set of gigantic, interconnected, heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Much knowledge {{can be derived from}} such <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> if we systematically develop an effective and scalable database-oriented <b>information</b> <b>network</b> analysis technology. In this tutorial, we introduce database-oriented <b>information</b> <b>network</b> analysis methods and demonstrate how <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> can be used to improve data quality and consistency, facilitate data integration, and generate interesting knowledge. This tutorial presents an organized picture on how to turn a database into one or a set of organized heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> how <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> can be used for data cleaning, data consolidation, and data qualify improvement, how to discover various kinds of knowledge from <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> how to perform OLAP in <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> and how to transform database data into knowledge by <b>information</b> <b>network</b> analysis. Moreover, we present interesting case studies on real datasets, including DBLP and Flickr, and show how interesting and organized knowledge can be generated from database-oriented <b>information</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Clustering {{analysis}} {{is a basic}} and essential method for mining heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> which consist of multiple types of objects and rich semantic relations among different object types. Heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> are ubiquitous in the real-world applications, such as bibliographic networks and social media networks. Unfortunately, most existing approaches, such as spectral clustering, are designed to analyze homogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> which are composed of only one type of objects and links. Some recent studies focused on heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and yielded some research fruits, such as RankClus and NetClus. However, they often assumed that the heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> usually follow some simple schemas, such as bityped network schema or star network schema. To overcome the above limitations, we model the heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>network</b> as a tensor without the restriction of network schema. Then, a tensor CP decomposition method is adapted to formulate the clustering problem in heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Further, we develop two stochastic gradient descent algorithms, namely, SGDClus and SOSClus, which lead to effective clustering multityped objects simultaneously. The experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world dataset have demonstrated that our proposed clustering framework can model heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> efficiently and outperform state-of-the-art clustering methods...|$|R

40|$|Most {{recommendations}} are made {{based on the}} computation of user specified constraints or functions of object similarity.

An <b>information</b> <b>network</b> can be constructed from different application networks such as social media, traffic management systems, and sensor <b>networks.</b> Heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> are now ubiquitous. How to make recommendations for the evidence-based decisions based on the fusion of these <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> presents a challenge. We present a framework of recommendations based on <b>information</b> <b>network</b> analysis. The practical examples are used to demonstrate the potential of this type of recommendation techniques.
