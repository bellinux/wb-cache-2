2500|$|The {{summit of}} the {{mountain}} is a gentle rise on the plateau and is only made obvious {{by the presence of}} an OS trig point. There are occasional quartzite outcrops across the summit plateau and some of the boulders have been collected to surround the trig point, a few iron <b>fence</b> <b>post</b> have also been included. The OS map also shows a 936-metre spot height, half a kilometre {{to the west of the}} recognised summit. The summit is crossed by [...] a line of old rusting boundary fence posts and these lead unerringly to the adjoining Munro of Càrn na Caim which lies five km to the north across a boggy col with a height of 825 metres.|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, 1909, fifteen carmakers' teams {{arrived at}} the track for practice. The track surface again became a concern with drivers being covered in dirt, oil, and tar and with ruts and chuckholes {{beginning}} to form in the turns. Speedway workers oiled and rolled the track prior to the gates opening to the public. Fifteen to twenty thousand spectators showed up, paying at the most $1 for a ticket. Halfway through the first [...] event, race leader Louis Chevrolet was temporarily blinded when a stone smashed his goggles. Wilfred Bourque, driving in a Knox, suffered a suspected rear-axle failure resulting in his car flipping end over end on the front stretch before crashing into a <b>fence</b> <b>post.</b> Both he and his mechanic, Harry Halcomb, died at the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and {{transportation}} costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to [...] per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and <b>fence</b> <b>post</b> preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons {{ran out of money}} and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.|$|E

2500|$|How can {{understanding}} of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? [...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden <b>fence</b> <b>post</b> perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, natterjack toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E

40|$|Historic {{concrete}} <b>fence</b> <b>posts</b> {{were created}} {{in the early twentieth}} century. This study examined how they were constructed and who constructed them. A survey of Randolph county, Indiana was conducted {{in order to determine the}} possible construction methods. Literature sources indicate that farmers were encouraged to construct concrete posts on their own. The survey also points to the idea that historic concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts</b> were created by the farmers who used them. While commercially manufactured posts exist in Randolph county, they are from a later date, and thus not the focus of this study. Interviews with members off the farming community also indicate that most farmers built their own concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts,</b> from molds they also made. While many businesses and colleges promoted the use and construction of concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts,</b> they were individually made to serve farmers' immediate and long term fencing needs.
