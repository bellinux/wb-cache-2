500|$|Remi Aubuchon {{was hired}} as the showrunner for the second season in May 2011 before the first season premiere. Once Aubuchon entered the writer's room, he began {{speaking}} of the cliffhanger [...] "it became a really fun challenge." [...] Out of that cliffhanger, says Aubuchon, [...] "came some really positive things that propel {{a lot of the}} storytelling in the second season. And the writers came up with a pretty cool way for Tom Mason to get off that spaceship again." [...] "You'll always catch people after a huge trauma saying, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad.' Or, 'It was fun,' Or, 'It was cool falling off that cliff,'" [...] says Aubuchon. [...] "The truth is, at first it was like, 'Oh my God, should i <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can't do this job?' Ultimately, though, I think it turned out cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as you remember the first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E
2500|$|Prominent Republican {{politicians}} {{reacted to}} the speech as well. Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have to <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> probably would too." [...] Huckabee suggested that he was [...] "probably the only conservative in America who's going to say something like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later {{explained}} [...] "I couldn't even go out {{the front}} of my house because there were all these girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
