40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the notch effect in two ferritc–pearlitic steels: S 275 JR and S 355 J 2. The research is based on the development and analysis of an experimental programme composed of 336 CT specimens, combining 6 different notch radii, and testing temperatures from the lower shelf up to the upper shelf of the two materials. The notch effect is analysed through the evolution of both the load bearing capacity and the apparent fracture toughness, and also through the relation between these two variables and the failure micromechanisms. The results reveal a clear notch effect in both materials. In the case of the load bearing capacity, this notch effect has its maximum at lower shelf temperatures. The notch effect in the apparent fracture presents a maximum at the lower temperatures of the ductileto-brittle transition zone. Finally, the Scanning Electron Microscopy <b>fractographies</b> have justified the previous observations...|$|R

In this paper, the TC 4 {{titanium}} {{matrix composite}} were fabricated by melting-casting process, the composite was reinforced with different content of B ranging from 0. 2 wt % to 1. 0 wt%.

The {{results indicate that}} the elastic modulus increase 15 %- 30 % for TC 4 /B composite with 0. 2 wt % to 1. 0 wt%B. The microstructures of as-cast TC 4 /B are consisted of lamellar α, grain boundaries β and the second phase of TiB, and the second phase TiB aggregates at the prior-β grain boundaries with necklace-like arrangement. The microstructures of TC 4 /B would refine with the increath of B content.

50|$|<b>Fractography</b> is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} in forensic engineering, forensic materials engineering and fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also to verify theoretical failure predictions with real life failures. It is of use in forensic science for analysing broken products which {{have been used as}} weapons, such as broken bottles for example. Thus a defendant might claim that a bottle was faulty and broke accidentally when it impacted a victim of an assault. <b>Fractography</b> could show the allegation to be false, and that considerable force was needed to smash the bottle before using the broken end as a weapon to deliberately attack the victim. Bullet holes in glass windscreens or windows can also indicate the direction of impact and the energy of the projectile. In these cases, the overall pattern of cracking is vital to reconstructing the sequence of events, rather than the specific characteristics of a single crack. <b>Fractography</b> can determine whether a cause of train derailment was a faulty rail, or if a wing of a plane had fatigue cracks before a crash.|$|E

40|$|International audiencehe {{safety of}} nuclear {{structures}} is crucial while the service time {{of nuclear power}} stations is planned to be extended up to 60 years. Initiation stage of cracks is still considered as a key issue, {{but more and more}} component integrity analyses investigate the crack arrest possibility. This study deals with physical mechanisms of cleavage crack propagation and numerical computations related to brittle fracture. Exper- iments using standard measuring techniques and a high-speed framing camera system, as well as Scan- ning Electron Microscope fracture surface analyses were carried out on thin CT specimens made of 16 MND 5 PWR vessel steel. The elastic-viscoplastic behavior of the ferritic steel has been studied and taken into account in numerical simulations. The eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) is used in CAST 3 M finite element analysis software to model crack propagation. Numerical computations combine a local non-linear dynamic approach and a fracture criterion based on critical cleavage stress, whereas current standards in the nuclear field use a global static approach to fracture to depict crack initiation and arrest. The links of the criterion with temperature and strain rate are considered thanks to experi- ments, SEM <b>fractographies</b> and 2 D computations {{in order to get a}} robust physical model which can be effective for model-based predictions of industrial structures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdditive Manufacturing offers real {{opportunities}} in Thales, since it enables a flexible and cost-effective production of metallic components {{directly from a}} 3 D digital data model. The manufacture of the parts, layer by layer, allows building more complex geometries by adding new functionalities or reducing the weight. The products of Thales can be more competitive and attractive. Studying and analysing the mechanical properties of such samples is essential. In {{order to be able}} to choose the eligible parts, design these parts and ensure their robustness, it is necessary to understand the static and fatigue behaviour of materials built by Additive Manufacturing and, more particularly, the damaging process regarding the microstructure. Following a first study on the static properties of a Titanium alloy used within Thales, a large set of fatigue tests, including both HCF and LCF, have been performed to evaluate the fatigue performances of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples built by a powder bed fusion process. The fatigue mechanisms and the obtained lifetimes were compared with more conventional processes (casting, wrought). In this paper, the results of these fatigue tests on Titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) samples will be presented. Different parameters have been compared: building orientation, heat treatment (HIP) and post-machining. The fracture mechanisms have also been analysed by performing a correlation between the microstructure analysis (porosity, metallography) and <b>fractographies.</b> It is shown that fatigue performances depend on the selected parameters but these effects are different, depending on the loading domain (HCF, LCF) ...|$|R

The effect of WC p particle contents (15 % and 3 %,volume fraction,the same as below) on the fatigue crack growth behavior of Cu/WC p composite was studied and the fracture surface was analyzed by SEM. The {{observation of the}} fatigue crack initiation and the influence mechanism of particle on fatigue crack growth {{was carried out by}} in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that the fatigue crack growth rate of Cu/WC p / 15 p composites is faster than that of Cu/WC p / 3 p composites at the same stress intensity factor range (Δ K);with the increase of WC p content,the threshold stress intensity factor range Δ K th is not enhanced because the interface of the particles and the matrix are weak. From the results of in-situ SEM observation fatigue crack growth can be seen that the crack source is formed due to the particle debonding during fatigue process,different debonding microcracks connect and grow to form main cracks is the fatigue damage mode of Cu/WC p particle reinforced composites. When the main crack tips encounter WC p particles,cracks propagate forward along the particle interface.

5000|$|An {{important}} aim of <b>fractography</b> is {{to establish}} and examine the origin of cracking, as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation.

50|$|Forensic {{materials}} engineering, {{a branch}} of forensic engineering, focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or {{the source of a}} specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined {{by the nature of the}} material in question, be it metal, glass, ceramic, polymer or composite. An important aspect is the analysis of trace evidence such as skid marks on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other.

50|$|Small {{specimens}} necessarily require intense illumination, {{especially at}} high magnifications, {{and this is}} usually provided by a fibre-optic light source. Fiber optics utilize halogen lamps which provide high light output for a given power input. The lamps are small enough to be fitted easily near the microscope, although they often need cooling to ameliorate high temperatures from the bulb. The fibre-optic stalk gives the operator much freedom in choosing appropriate lighting conditions for the sample. The stalk is encased in a sheath that is easy to move and manipulate to any desired position. The stalk is normally unobtrusive when the lit end is near the specimen, so usually does {{not interfere with the}} image in the microscope. Examination of fracture surfaces frequently need oblique lighting so as to highlight surface features during <b>fractography,</b> and fibre-optic lights are ideal for this purpose. Several such light stalks can be used for the same specimen, so increasing the illumination yet further.|$|E
