40|$|This article clarifies the {{institutional}} framework {{and practice of}} the state budget compilation process in Russia, taking the 2001 federal budget as an example. The budget {{was the first one}} compiled under the new national financial system, including the <b>Budget</b> <b>Code</b> of the Russian Federation, which came into force in January 2000. The <b>Budget</b> <b>Code</b> is greatly superior to the preceding one, in the socialist era, which regulated Russia's financial activities during the initial phase of the transition period. Under the new legal system the 2001 budget was drafted by the Ministry of Finance, approved by the government, submitted to the Federal Assembly, discussed at the State Duma and finally approved by the Federation Council. A detailed analysis of this process shows that a certain order is emerging in the budget compilation process due to the comparatively amicable relationship {{between the government and the}} Federal Assembly and because of the establishment of the new legal system, including the <b>Budget</b> <b>Code.</b> The new financial system, however, has many problems, indicating that Russia will not be able to accomplish institutional changes in this field all at once. ...|$|R

This study investigates how the presence of commercially valued marine species such as seabass, snapper and siganid affect the growth of luminous bacteria in shrimp culture water.

For the investigation of tilapia water, Tilapia hornorum was stocked at different biomasses 0, 1 and 3 kg/ 10 m 3. Vibrio harveyi {{was introduced to the}} tanks at a final concentration of 10 3 cfu/ml. Luminous bacteria could not be detected in tanks stocked at 3 kg/ 10 m 3 from day 4 to day 6, and on day 6 in tanks stocked at 1 kg/ 10 m 3. The bacteria could still be recovered in tanks without tilapia on day 6. Investigation of the effect of chlorella alone on V. harveyi was undertaken using sterile flasks containing 500 -ml autoclaved seawater provided with aeration. In treated flasks Chlorella was added, whereas no Chlorella was added to control flasks.

40|$|To {{restore the}} {{diminishing}} {{population of the}} giant clam Tridacna gigas in Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR), Negros Occidental, central Philippines, two size classes [8 - and 10 -cm shell length (SL) ] of hatchery-bred T. gigas were reared in an adjacent ocean nursery for restocking to Carbin Reef later upon reaching grow-out size of â‰¥ 20 cm SL. Growth rates did not significantly differ for both sizes and were on average 0. 67 cm month âˆ’ 1. However, survival after 382 days of rearing T. gigas was significantly higher in the 10 -cm SL clams than the 8 -cm SL clams (96 and 83 %, respectively). For future restocking projects, the use of 8 -cm SL clams is recommended because the lower survival of this size class is compensated by its cheaper price. While rearing the clams to attain grow-out size, the population of wild clams (Family Tridacnidae) in Carbin Reef was assessed using ten 50 Ã— 2 -m belt transects. Four species of tridacnid clams have been recorded: Hippopus hippopus, Tridacna crocea, T. maxima>, and T. squamosa. T. crocea comprised 12. 5 â€“ 93. 9 % of all the clams observed in all ten transects. There {{was a significant difference}} in clam density between species (ANOVA, F = 6. 94, P < 0. 001), with T. crocea having the highest density. Living T. gigas were absent, but presence of dead shells was indicative of its presence in the reef in the past. It can be expected that the release of hatchery-bred T. gigas juveniles in Carbin Reef could provide future breeders that will repopulate this reef and the adjacent reef communities.

40|$|The IDB {{has made}} {{important}} investments in results measurement and reporting mechanism {{over the past}} few years. Although significant improvements have taken place, IDB's main mechanism for reporting on project-level results, the Project Completion Report (PCR), needs to improve. The limited usefulness of PCRs, issues with the PCR template, and limited guidance to PCR authors have contributed to poor quality PCRs. Lack of clarity in the resources available and weak staff incentives to produce good quality reports are also probable causes of poor quality PCRs. Lack of a systematic validation of PCR results might have contributed to the poor incentive structure. In light of the findings, the IDB is advised to improve the PCR system by: (a) revising the current template to better harmonize with the newly updated Development Effectiveness Framework (DEF) and the Evaluation Cooperation Group-Good Practice Standards (ECG-GPS) and adopting the new template by January 2013, (b) strengthening the PCR production process and staff incentives, and (c) using a separate <b>budget</b> <b>code</b> and ensuring adequate funding for PCRs. ...|$|R
40|$|Restoration {{efforts in}} the Mediterranean Basin have been {{changing}} from a silvicultural to an ecological restoration approach. Yet, {{to what extent the}} projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86 %). The projects used mainly soil from local sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union (EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than EU countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used were mostly of local or regional provenance, whilst seeds were mostly of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e. g. inadequate biodiversity) were reported for 50 % of the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22 %. Long term evaluation (> 6 years) was only performed in 31 % of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species of exogenous provenances may: i) entail the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects in the Mediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more long-term monitoring and evaluation, including functional and ecosystem services' indicators, to improve and spread the practice of ecological restoration.

40|$|The <b>Budget</b> <b>Code</b> of the Russian Federation {{requires}} that local self-governments prepare their budgets {{for the next}} year taking into account the likely economic situation in that year. To date these governments have had little guidance to use in preparing their budgets. This paper reports the results of initial steps to develop a procedure for forecasting key economic parameters at the local level. “Local level ” is defined as cities that are capitals of Subjects of the Federation (similar to U. S. states); generally these are cities of over 100, 000 population. Econometric models are reported for employment, manufacturing production, retail sales, average wage rates, volume of newly constructed housing, and fixed capital formation. The choice of estimation procedures was significantly constrained by data availability. The current document is an interim report, prepared after the basic econometric work has been completed but before the model is tested in actual forecasting. The paper consists of six further sections. The first lists the economic variables to be projected. The second describes the economic logic underlying the models specified for each variable. The third section then outlines the econometric strategy. This is followed in the fourth section with an overview of the data employed in the estimates. The fifth section presents the final models. The paper closes with a short discussion of the plans for future work in this direction. In the next phase of the work the forecasting qualities of these models will be evaluated. ...|$|R
