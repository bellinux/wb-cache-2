5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> number of {{electrons}} in a given volume.

This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; {{this means that the}} density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
