25|$|Like many Allied leaders, Wilson {{believed}} {{after the}} {{victory at the}} Marne {{that the war was}} as good as won. He told Joffre's staff officer General Henri Mathias Berthelot (13 September) that the Allies would be in Elsenborn on the German-Belgian frontier in four weeks (Berthelot thought three). Wilson also helped to persuade Joffre (late September) to allow the BEF to redeploy further {{to the left of the}} Allied line. When French, Murray and Wilson arrived to confer with Foch (then commanding the French Armies in that sector) in early October 1914, Foch greeted Sir John with a handshake but threw his arms around Wilson’s neck and <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Brabourne hosted 17 Test matches between 1948 and 1973, {{starting}} with two matches against the West Indies in India's first home series after the World War II in 1948–49. The first test {{to produce a}} result at the Brabourne was the fourth it hosted, when India beat Pakistan in 1952. India won their first ever test series after taking a 2–1 lead {{on the basis of}} this victory. Vijay Hazare scored a hundred in each of his four test match appearances at the ground, the most by any player. Indian batsman Abbas Ali Baig became the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on a cricket field during the third Test between India and Australia at the Brabourne in 1960. When Baig reached the fifty run mark, a young woman ran onto the ground from the North Stand and <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> his cheek in full view of a packed crowd. During a test match in 1964, several members of the visiting England team faced fitness issues, forcing England to request India to provide a substitute fielder. On successive days, A. G. Kripal Singh and Hanumant Singh took the field as substitutes for Micky Stewart.|$|E

It was Nasser's first visit to Saudi Arabia since 1956. At the request of the Egyptians, due to assassination rumors, the banners and flags normally put up to celebrate a visiting dignitary were omitted, the sidewalks were cleared of people, and the car was a special bulletproof model. On the evening of his arrival, Nasser was welcomed at a banquet and reception for 700 guests. In less than 48 hours they reached full agreement.

500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord!

2500|$|While {{performing}} in October 1991 at Gigi's (a Houston strip club later renamed as [...] "Pleasures"), Smith met elderly oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall, {{and they began}} a relationship. During their two-year affair, he reportedly lavished gifts on her {{and asked her to}} marry him several times. She divorced her husband Billy on February 3, 1993, in Houston. On June 27, 1994, 26-year-old Smith and 89-year-old Marshall were married in Houston. This resulted in a great deal of gossip about her marrying him for his money.

Smith, however, maintained that she loved her husband, and age did not matter to her. Thirteen months after his marriage to Smith, Marshall died in Houston on August 4, 1995, at age 90.|$|E
2500|$|As Victory {{approached}} the enemy {{line on the}} morning of 21 October 1805, Hardy urged Nelson to transfer to another ship to avoid the inevitable melee, but Nelson refused. Victory, leading the weather column, came under heavy fire in the opening stages of the Battle of Trafalgar.
