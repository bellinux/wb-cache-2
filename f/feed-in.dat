5|$|With <b>feed-in</b> tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a <b>feed-in</b> tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with <b>feed-in</b> tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of <b>feed-in</b> tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feed-in</b> tariffs are {{designated}} prices {{which must be}} paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid. These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) {{began its}} Standard Offer Program, a {{precursor}} to the Green Energy Act, and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10MW. The <b>feed-in</b> tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh {{over a period of}} twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid <b>feed-in</b> in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid <b>feed-in</b> can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of <b>feed-in</b> tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as <b>feed-in</b> tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred {{installations}} over 1 MWp {{have been}} since been installed in Germany, of {{which more than}} 50 are over 10 MWp. With its introduction of <b>feed-in</b> tariffs in 2008, Spain became briefly the largest market, with some 60 solar parks over 10 MW, but these incentives have since been withdrawn. The USA, China India, France, Canada, and Italy, amongst others, have also become major markets as shown {{on the list of}} photovoltaic power stations.|$|E
5|$|The first 1 MWp {{solar park}} {{was built by}} Arco Solar at Lugo near Hesperia, California {{at the end of}} 1982, {{followed}} in 1984 by a 5.2 MWp installation in Carrizo Plain. Both have since been decommissioned, though Carrizo Plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed or planned. The next stage followed the 2004 revisions to the <b>feed-in</b> tariffs in Germany when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>Feed-in</b> tariffs in the United Kingdom in 2010 stimulated {{the first wave}} of utility-scale projects, with c. 20 plants being completed before tariffs were reduced on 1 August 2011 following the 'Fast Track Review'. A second wave of installations was undertaken under the UK's Renewables Obligation, with the total number of plants connected by the end of March 2013 reaching 86. This is reported to have made the UK Europe's best market {{in the first quarter of}} 2013.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a <b>feed-in</b> tariff.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale <b>feed-in</b> tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
25|$|Experience has {{demonstrated}} that a <b>feed-in</b> tariff is both the least expensive and {{the most effective means}} of developing solar power. Investors need certainty, which they receive from a <b>feed-in</b> tariff. California enacted a <b>feed-in</b> tariff which began on February 14, 2008. Washington state has a <b>feed-in</b> tariff of 15¢/kWh which increases to 54¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. Hawaii, Michigan, and Vermont also have feed in tariffs.|$|E
25|$|An SREC {{program is}} an {{alternative}} to the <b>feed-in</b> tariff model popular in Europe. The key difference between the two models is the market-based mechanism that drives the value of the SRECs, and therefore the value of the subsidy for solar. In a <b>feed-in</b> tariff model, the government sets the value for the electricity produced by a solar facility. If the level is higher, more solar power is built and the program is more costly. If the <b>feed-in</b> tariff is set lower, less solar power is built and the program is ineffective. The problem with SRECs is a lack of certainty for investors. A <b>feed-in</b> tariff provides a known return on investment, while an SREC program provides a possible return on investment.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009 Vermont {{created the}} first state-wide {{renewable}} energy <b>feed-in</b> law.|$|E
25|$|The Electricity <b>Feed-in</b> Act {{was enacted}} by a CDU/CSU/FDP {{coalition}} government.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{subsidies}} and financial incentives, e.g., <b>feed-in</b> tariffs {{for renewable energy}} (Gupta et al., 2007:762).|$|E
25|$|Solar-specific <b>feed-in</b> tariffs vary {{by country}} and within countries. Such tariffs {{encourage}} {{the development of}} solar power projects.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) {{ruled that}} states {{were able to}} {{implement}} above-market <b>feed-in</b> tariffs for specific technologies.|$|E
25|$|Kathy Castor (D-FL) {{offered an}} {{amendment}} giving states {{the ability to}} adopt <b>feed-in</b> tariffs for renewable energy as defined in the bill.|$|E
25|$|An SPD/Greens {{coalition}} government, {{elected in}} 1998, {{paved the way}} for the reform of the Electricity <b>Feed-in</b> Act to give the EEG (2000).|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, a <b>feed-in</b> tariff {{scheme was}} {{approved}} {{which has led to}} many residential and commercial solar energy power station projects.|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} offer incentives in {{the form}} of, for example, <b>feed-in</b> tariffs for feeding electricity onto the power grid to subsidize green energy production.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 2008 the Israeli Public Utility Authority {{approved}} a <b>feed-in</b> tariff for solar plants. The tariff {{is limited to}} a total installation of 50MW during 7 years, whichever is reached first, with a maximum of 15 kWp installation for residential and a maximum of 50kWp for commercial. The National Infrastructures Ministry announced on December 2009 on expanding the <b>feed-in</b> tariff scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 kilowatts to 5 megawatts, though only one project was approved by June 2010.|$|E
25|$|<b>Feed-In</b> Tariffs are {{intended}} to incentivise small-scale (less than 5MW), low-carbon electricity generation. These <b>feed-in</b> tariffs work alongside the Renewables Obligation (RO), which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources. They also currently offer up to 21p per kWh from December 2011 in the Tariff for photovoltaics plus another 3p for the Export Tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity.|$|E
25|$|Some jurisdictions go {{one step}} further and have instituted <b>feed-in</b> tariff, which allows any power {{customer}} to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally.|$|E
25|$|Net {{metering}} {{and financial}} incentives, such as preferential <b>feed-in</b> tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries. More than 100 countries now use solar PV.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{power output}} reduces spot market prices in general via the merit order effect; in 2008 this caused a net {{reduction}} of pre-tax electricity prices (balancing the {{increase from the}} <b>feed-in</b> law).|$|E
25|$|Through a ministerial {{ruling in}} March 2004, the Spanish {{government}} removed economic {{barriers to the}} connection of renewable energy technologies to the electricity grid. The Royal Decree 436/2004 equalized conditions for large-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic plants and guaranteed <b>feed-in</b> tariffs.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 2011, the {{government}} announced a sudden cut in the <b>feed-in</b> tariff from 43.3p/kWh to 21p/kWh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar PV installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 December 2011.|$|E
25|$|In Kenya, the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is {{in charge}} of {{renewable}} energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the <b>feed-in</b> tariff policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey {{leads the}} nation with the least {{restrictive}} net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. California decided {{that it is not}} moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a <b>feed-in</b> tariff. Washington state has a <b>feed-in</b> tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage. Tesla {{and a handful of other}} companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale grid energy storage including very large batteries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{policies}} like <b>feed-in</b> tariff are applied. Besides, {{with the}} Kyoto Protocol, the program called the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{that allows for}} industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries {{as an alternative to}} more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.|$|E
25|$|The year 2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act {{provided}} for a <b>feed-in</b> tariff {{in support of}} renewable energy. The German government, declaring climate protection as a key policy issue, announced a carbon dioxide reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%. In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284nbsp&PJ of primary energy demand, which corresponded to 5% of the total electricity demand. By 2010, the German government wanted to reach 10%.; in fact, 17% were reached (2011: 20%, 2015: 30%).|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as <b>feed-in</b> tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, {{there were}} 230,000 solar power {{projects}} in the United Kingdom, with a total installed generating capacity of 750 megawatts (MW). By February 2012 the installed capacity had reached 1,000 MW. Solar power use has increased very rapidly in recent years, albeit from a small base, {{as a result of}} reductions in the cost of photovoltaic (PV) panels, and the introduction of a <b>Feed-in</b> tariff (FIT) subsidy in April 2010. In 2012, the government said that 4 million homes across the UK will be powered by the sun within eight years, representing 22,000 MW of installed solar power capacity by 2020.|$|E
