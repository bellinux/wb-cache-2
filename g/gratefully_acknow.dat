40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Mark Spiegel for helpful comments. Research {{assistance}} by Barbara Rizzi is <b>gratefully</b> <b>acknow</b> l-e d ge d. This paper uses a fo u r- va ri able vector autoregression model to explore how monetary authorities responded to shocks in Korea and Taiwan over the period 1981. 1 – 1994. 12. The analysis reveals that sterilization is an important element of the response to shocks to foreign assets in both econ-omies. In particular, monetary authorities {{do not appear to be}} prepared to accept fluctuations in the exchange rate and the money supply that may result from changes in for-eign assets, but more readily accept fluctuations in these variables that result from domestic credit shocks. There are also differences in the responses of Korea and Taiwan that suggest that the former may be more insulated fro...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{accuracy}} of the Lee / Ready (1991) trade classification algorithm and the simpler tick test. Our definition of true trade classification is based on whether the Makler (the equivalent of the specialist on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) bought or sold shares. The Lee / Ready method classifies only 72. 8 % of the transactions correctly. The simpler tick test performs almost equally well. We document that misclassification of trades may systematically bias the results of empirical microstructure research. Finally, we show that estimation of the bid-ask spread from transactions data results in a reasonably accurate estimate of the relative liquidity of our sample stocks. This is an important finding because quote data for the German stock market is not available on a regular basis.

40|$|Attached is {{a copy of}} {{the first}} edition of Caltrans Guide Specifications for Seismic Design of Steel Bridges (Guide). The {{provisions}} presented in the Guide are based on past successful experiences, various codes and specifications, state-of-the-art research and know ledge. The Guide has passed through five successive drafts and critical reviews silnce January 2000. It has been developed as a consensus document to provide a uniform guideline for the seismic design of the steel bridges. The Guide is supplemental to the current Caltrans SI>C Version 1. 2 published in December 2001. These provisions shall be applied in conjunction 1 With the current Caltrans Bridge Design Specifications (LFD Version April 2000). The development of the Guide was a joint team effort product of the Structural Steel Committee, the Earthquake Engineering Committee, and included many people who gave unselfishly of their · · time and talent. This effort is <b>gratefully</b> <b>acknow</b> Iedged. Questions regarding the Guide should be addressed by the appropriate Seismic Specialist or Structural Steel Committee Member or Earthquake Committee Representative for each unit...|$|E
