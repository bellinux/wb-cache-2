2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby not to leave the ranch. However, she {{does not want to be}} bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not." [...] When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.|$|E

[...] "What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> {{by coming}} after {{me up to}} London like this? What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by tempting me? I can't stand the sight of him. I won't be challenged, Lucy; I don't know whether it's the devil or not, but when I saw the fellow to-day I had hard work to keep my hands off him. I wanted to spring at his throat. I {{would have liked to}} {{throttle}} him!" ...|$|R

5000|$|For this {{he gives}} Mageoghegan. Which Mageoghegan <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> Connell or the Abbe? Can any {{authority}} {{be found for}} this, earlier than Mageoghegan? ...|$|R

60|$|Peter's {{turn came}} next. He {{did not write}} his sermon out. That, he averred, was too hard work. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to take a text.|$|E
60|$|What {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> under present circumstances, by putting such a {{question}} to me as that? I stared at him, instead of answering him.|$|E
