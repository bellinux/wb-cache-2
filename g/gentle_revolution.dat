50|$|The Velvet Revolution or <b>Gentle</b> <b>Revolution</b> was a non-violent {{revolution}} in Czechoslovakia {{that saw the}} overthrow of the Communist government. It is seen {{as one of the most}} important of the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Bookchin {{lamented the}} decline of American anarchism into primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-situationism, {{individual}} self-expression, and [...] "ad hoc adventurism," [...] {{at the expense of}} forming a social movement. Arthur Verslius said, [...] "Bookchin... describes himself as a 'social anarchist' because he looks forward to a (<b>gentle)</b> societal <b>revolution....</b> Bookchin has lit out after those whom he terms 'lifestyle anarchists.'" [...] The publication of Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism in 1995, criticizing this tendency, was startling to anarchists. Thereafter Bookchin concluded that American anarchism was essentially individualistic and broke with anarchism publicly in 1999. He placed his ideas into a new political ideology: Communalism (spelled with a capital [...] "C" [...] to differentiate it from other forms of communalism), a form of libertarian socialism that retains his ideas about assembly democracy and the necessity of decentralization of settlement, power/money/influence, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Velvet Revolution (sametová revoluce) or <b>Gentle</b> <b>Revolution</b> (nežná revolúcia) was a non-violent {{transition}} {{of power in}} what was then Czechoslovakia, occurring from November 17 to December 29, 1989. Popular demonstrations against the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia combined students and older dissidents. The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and the subsequent dismantling of the planned economy and conversion to a parliamentary republic.|$|E
5000|$|The term Velvet Revolution {{was coined}} by Rita Klímová, the dissidents' English {{translator}} {{who later became}} the ambassador to the United States. [...] The term was used internationally to describe the revolution, although the Czechs also used the term internally. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Slovakia used the term <b>Gentle</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the term that Slovaks used for the revolution from the beginning. The Czech Republic continues {{to refer to the}} event as the Velvet Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|Moore’s first {{excursion}} {{into the}} design field (and her only effort at actually designing) {{was the creation of}} a sandal in the early 1940s that she sold to high-end stores in Los Angeles. In the early 1950s, Moore became the founding president of the Pasadena Art Alliance, which that was organized to provide support to art institutions in Pasadena, particularly the Pasadena Art Museum.  By 1957 she was president {{of the board of the}} museum.  Continuing her long-standing interest in crafts, in 1961 she took over the Museum’s series of California Design exhibitions, changing them from small, annual shows of furniture into [...] "a blockbuster juried triennial" [...] of virtually anything designed or made in California.  Moore produced California Design shows for the museum in 1962, 1965, 1968, and 1971 and related exhibitions in 1974 (California Design 1910) and 1976 (California Design ’76) at other venues. She was curator of design of the museum from 1962 to 1974, when the Pasadena Art Museum closed and became the Norton Simon Museum.  In addition to the California Design exhibitions, Moore prepared and edited books and filmstrips on design and organized and mounted a variety of other exhibitions and activities in the crafts, including Islands in the Land, about traditional crafts, and the international symposium Fiber as Medium. She also conceived The Craftsman Lifestyle: The <b>Gentle</b> <b>Revolution</b> (1976), written by Olivia Emery, and was the moving force behind a review of contemporary American design titled Design U.S.A. (1972).|$|E
40|$|What drives {{young people}} to become {{involved}} in music making in the second-ary school? Changes to the curriculum in Scottish schools over the last three decades have resulted in a marked upturn in the numbers of pupils studying music. The inclusion of a wider range of acceptable instruments for examin-ation purposes has resulted in rock music being accepted as a valid form of music within the curriculum. The paper discusses the growth and development of this phenomenon and the philosophical and practical issues arising from what, in some ways, has been a quiet and <b>gentle</b> <b>revolution.</b> The conditions required to allow this new musical democracy to flourish are examined and Csikszentmihalyi’s ’flow ’ model (Csikszentmihalyi, 1992) is suggested as a possible reflective tool that educators can use to monitor, regulate and assess learning in music. Visit a Scottish secondary school and as you approach the music department you begin to hear the strains of I Try by Macy Gray (1999) in the distance although, as you turn the corner, a boy and girl are strumming guitars, usin...|$|E
40|$|This work draws a fine {{between a}} {{specific}} instance of expressive culture, Girl Scout ceremony, and gradual, widespread cultural change {{with respect to}} empowering American girls and women. ^ Roger Abrahams 2 ̆ 7 “language of festivals” (1982) helps break down Girl Scout ceremony into components representing genres such as symbolic action, decorative art, music, costume, and foodways, which are then recombined. The collection of these elements appears as a syncretization of inheritances from youth movements and women 2 ̆ 7 s organizations, along with other elements (e. g. American Folk Revival materials; traditions developed within American Girl Scouting). Unlike the non-literate cultural groups which have traditionally occupied folklorists 2 ̆ 7 attention, Girl Scouts syncretize oral and written inheritances in their expressive culture. The Girl Scout ceremony tradition is for specific groups of individuals to consciously recombine or syncretize traditional elements and innovations, and thus learn and communicate through an event 2 ̆ 7 s design. ^ I trace the empowerment of girls and women through Girl Scout ceremony form, production, and discourse. Form syncretizes expressive elements from programs intended to empower boys (Boy Scouting) and women (e. g. women 2 ̆ 7 s social, service, and study clubs). The method of production—planning and carrying out expressive events—empowers through cultural agency and through training the planners in management skills. Empowering discourses in Girl Scout ceremony appear in words like “self-esteem,” “self-expression,” and “decision-making,” and also through more complex themes: building strength in the individual (honor, dreams, achievement), building strength in the group (sisterhood, patriotism, citizenship), and {{the combination of the}} two (service, leadership). ^ Applying coding theory, I argue that throughout Girl Scouting, including ceremony, one finds cultural expressions which operate on at least two levels, one challenging male dominant culture and another which does not threaten male dominance. Many of these techniques resemble the coding historically used by women 2 ̆ 7 s voluntary associations (e. g. framing power and leadership in the community as patriotism or good mothering). Others come about through the syncretization of a youth movement and the women 2 ̆ 7 s voluntary association heritage (e. g. appropriating male outdoor and technical training offset by continuing training in traditional domestic arts; training in both male and female emotional discourses). ^ Accounting for the conservative image of Girl Scouting, I develop the ideas of failed codes and internal coding. Often Girl Scouts will code for themselves, avoiding controversial terms like “feminism” in order to accommodate the largest possible chunk of the political spectrum (to which members and members 2 ̆ 7 guardians belong) and thus become a large and inclusive organization. The complex combination of internal and external coding, a variegated heritage, local autonomy, and continuous change can also result in failed codes when, for instance, individual adult volunteers emphasize traditional disempowerment of females (often turning off girl interest) or feminist outsiders do not recognize the empowering processes and withdraw support. ^ Over this phenomenon of complexity, subtlety, mixed and coded messages, and syncretization, exists a gradual multi-generational movement, a <b>gentle</b> <b>revolution.</b> The slowness, subtlety, variety, and folklife focus in turn present a methodological puzzle: how can one study change through time when (1) the expressive and political behaviors are generally considered too trivial to record and memory fails and (2) the process is so subtle that participants commonly do not identify the empowering effect until years of cumulative impressions or (in the case of child members) in retrospect in adulthood? I use three main types of research to address this problem. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
