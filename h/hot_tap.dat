5000|$|There {{are various}} types of line {{stopping}} heads. The oldest and still most widely used method of line plugging is the pivoting head style line stop. This technology {{dates back to the}} 1930s. The pivot head line stop requires a full size on size <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> in order to be inserted into the operating piping system. Other methods include the folding head line stop which enters the pipe through a reduced branch <b>hot</b> <b>tap,</b> the Sure-Stop line stop which intersects the pipe and doesn't seal inside the pipe like other methods, and the HTP which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of line stops can safely stop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>tapping</b> is {{also the}} first {{procedure}} in line stopping, where a hole saw is used to make {{an opening in the}} pipe, so a line plugging head can be inserted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>tapping,</b> or {{pressure}} tapping, is {{the method}} of making a connection to existing piping or pressure vessels without the interrupting or emptying that section of pipe or vessel. This means that a pipe or tank can continue to be in operation whilst maintenance or modifications are being done to it. The process {{is also used to}} drain off pressurized casing fluids and add test points or various sensors such as temperature and pressure. <b>Hot</b> <b>taps</b> can range from a ½ inch hole designed for something as simple as quality control testing, up to a 48 inch tap for the installation of a variety of ports, valves, t-sections or other pipes.|$|R

5000|$|Line {{stopping}} or line plugging is a {{means of}} isolating a piping system to provide a shut off where none exists. This process serves as a control, or temporary valve, that can be removed after alterations or valve replacements have been made. With a <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> previously made on a line, a line stopper is attached to a temporary valve, and the valve is opened. The line stopper is hydraulically or mechanically pushed into the line to seal the pipe. The main is supported by the line stop sleeve. After performing the necessary service, the stop is removed, and a blind flange is installed on the sleeve.|$|E

She then investigates after Jack becomes more and more evasive. She tracks down Richie who tells her Jack was not responsible but she doesn't believe him and on her return to the village, she steals a can of petrol from the garage and douses the house with it, threatening to set the place alight unless the truth is told. Andy confesses but when Jack tries to clean Victoria's bloody head after a fall with water from the <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> on a flannel, it makes the house explode.

5000|$|As {{the formula}} shows, the COP of a {{heat pump system}} can be {{improved}} by reducing the temperature gap [...] minus [...] at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the output temperature to around 30 C which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank [...] ). Accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop [...] or borehole sizing, resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system. For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see hydraulic head). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing {{the size of the}} internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the efficiency (and the price) relative {{to the power of the}} compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing <b>hot</b> <b>tap</b> water.|$|E
50|$|On 16 October 2007, after {{yet another}} row with Jack about Diane, Victoria went off alone and got drunk. The {{teenager}} had been rifling through old newspaper clippings {{of the fire}} that killed her mother. One of the pictures was of Sarah’s lover, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont), who had been there and survived. Victoria had decided to pay Richie a visit, in a last-ditch attempt {{to find out the}} truth about the night her mother died. Richie told her he couldn't help her. Begrudgingly, Richie described the events leading up to fire, including how Jack had threatened to kill him and Sarah for their betrayal. Richie was adamant, telling Victoria it wasn't her dad. Victoria didn't believe Richie and returned to the village and was promptly sick from the alcohol. Spotting Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) down the road, she ran into a nearby garage to hide. She overheard Andy bump into Jack, who told him Victoria had not gone to school. The pair set off to look for her together. Inside the garage, a clearly disturbed Victoria spotted a petrol can. She picked it up. Victoria took the can home and doused the furniture with petrol. Moments later, Jack and Andy returned to Annie's Cottage and immediately smelled the fumes. Then they saw Victoria, poised with a lighter in her hand, ready to set the place alight. Victoria was screaming at her dad to tell her the truth about how her mother died or else they'd {{know what it feels like}} to burn. Unable to stay quiet any longer, Andy shocked Victoria by telling her that he had started the fire that led to Sarah's death. Victoria looked at her brother in horror and then fled upstairs where she fell and hurt her head badly. She was put on her bed, bleeding. Andy stayed with her while Jack went into the bathroom to soak a towel in warm water to clean his daughter’s head. He had forgotten about the petrol fumes in the house when he turned on the <b>hot</b> <b>tap.</b> The pilot light in the boiler came on and ignited the fumes. A massive explosion ripped through the house. Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor) had been walking towards the cottage and was knocked to the ground with the force of the blast. Inside Annie's Cottage, the lounge was a raging inferno, where Victoria had soaked everything in petrol. As the fire took hold, there was a second explosion. Andy and Victoria were in her bedroom and Andy smashed her window. He swept her up in his arms and carried her to the window. By now many of the villagers, including Jonny Foster (Richard Grieve), Matthew King (Matt Healy), Perdita Hyde-Sinclair (Georgia Slowe), Diane, Billy and others, were standing outside. Jonny waited below the bedroom window with his arms up, telling Andy to drop his sister down. With Victoria safe, Andy went back for Jack but a wall of fire separated them. Billy climbed a ladder, which was set up outside, and got Andy to the window where he jumped out onto a hay truck, that Matthew had hot-wired and parked under the window. Using a blanket for cover, Billy got Jack from the bathroom and out the bedroom window. As Billy was about to climb out, numerous half-empty alcohol bottles caught fire creating another explosion, which blew Billy across the room. The fire services retrieved an unconscious Billy from the house.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{measure the}} water {{temperature}} issuing from {{a representative sample of}} patient-accessible outlets around the Royal Adelaide Hospital. To initiate an audit cycle in the event of unacceptably high water temperatures to ensure their reduction. Methods: Samples were taken of water issuing from <b>hot</b> <b>taps,</b> showers, and hand hygiene basins in patient areas throughout the hospital, encompassing newly renovated as well as old sections of the hospital. A 45 second “warming ” period was followed by hot water collection into a polystyrene cup to 8 cm. The mean of 3 temperatures measured using an infrared thermometer was calculated. Results: Several taps and patient showers were demonstrated to supply water at a temperature capable of causing scald injuries. Most problem outlets were found in the oldest section of the hospital, fewer in the wing of “intermediate ” age and none in the most recently renovated emergency block. The data were tabulated and summarized before being passed on to RAH Engineering and Building Services, which initiated remedial action. Several thermostatic mixing valves were found to be faulty (and replaced) or poorly set (and re-set). After this adjustment, outlets previously supplying excessively hot water were re-tested and found to be safe...|$|R
