50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>managers</b> are {{involved}} in processes that seek to control some environmental entities in orientation to a plan or idea. Whether such control is possible, however, is contested. Examples for <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> range from corporate agents (corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>managers)</b> via managers of a nature reserve, to environmental and resource planning agents but, analytically seen, also involve indigenous <b>environmental</b> <b>managers,</b> farmers or <b>environmental</b> activists. In many accounts, hope is held that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> implement grand plans or political programmes. For example, specific schools of thought like ecological modernisation but also widespread conceptions of environmental management and environmental activism presuppose human agents who have ideas, make plans and engage in action oriented at the plans' implementation. At {{the heart of the}} notion of <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> is, thus, a pragmatic and rational actor who optimises environments in orientation to some aim. Critical academics point out that the very idea that such managers exist and are imagined as capable of managing may well be flawed.|$|R

40|$|Firms are {{subjected}} to competing institutional logics, and a key concern is how these institutional logics are managed at the firm level. Two contentious logics facing the firms are that {{of the market and}} the natural environment. Focusing on firms’ <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> and drawing on institutional work we ask {{what is the nature of}} the institutional work done by <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> in managing the competing institutional logics of the market and the environment, and does the nature of this work change in response to exogenous shocks? We draw on repeated-interviews with 55 <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> in 2006 and 2008, and fin d that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> draw on different permutations of creation, maintenance and disruption to bridge the market and the environmental logic at the firm level.

40|$|Firms face {{a variety}} of {{institutional}} logics and one important question is how individuals within firms manage these logics. <b>Environmental</b> <b>managers</b> in particular face tensions in reconciling their firms’ commercial fortunes with demands for greater environmental responsiveness. We explore how institutional work enables <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> to respond to competing institutional logics. Drawing on repeated interviews with 55 firms, we find that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> face competition between a market-based logic and an emerging environmental logic. We show that some <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> embed the <b>environmental</b> logic alongside the market logic through variations of creation and disruption, thus over time creating institutional change, which can result in blended logics. Others, however, pursue a strategy of status quo or disengagement through maintenance {{or other forms of}} disruption, where the two logics coexist in principle but not in practice; instead the market logic retains its dominance. We discuss the implications of our findings for research...|$|R
40|$|A {{changing}} {{business climate}} {{has led many}} organizations to embrace environmental sustainability and social responsibility; however, organizational roles and responsibilities in sustainability initiatives have not been clearly defined. This paper specifically examines the role of <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> in advancing <b>environmental</b> sustainability and social responsibility. It {{is part of a}} broader study to identify the extent to which various departments or functional units within an organization are prepared {{to play a role in}} these initiatives based on a survey of various professionals in relation to activities and action items derived from the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility. As expected, the findings indicate that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> are positioned to play a critical role in advancing environmental sustainability and social responsibility in their organizations. However, there appears to be disparity between the role that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> indicated they are prepared to play and the perceptions of their role held by others in the organization. While <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> indicated that they would support or play a major role in 18 of the 35 action items on which they were surveyed, professionals from other functional units indicated that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> would be involved in only a few key areas focused on traditional environmental issues associated with pollution prevention and waste management. This suggests that <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> are prepared to play a much broader role in the organization’s sustainability and social responsibility efforts but may not be fully utilized in this capacity...|$|R

40|$|Governments in Australia are {{purchasing}} water entitlements {{to secure}} water for environmental benefit, but entitlements generate an allocation profile {{that does not}} correspond fully to environmental flow requirements.

The results suggest that while irrigators now have access to greater risk-management options, <b>environmental</b> <b>managers</b> should consider the possible impact of institutional change before intervening in traditional market activity.

50|$|Despite the EPA’s {{claims of}} a “strong {{partnership}} with the Navajo Nation,” recent articles have been published that {{call into question the}} equitability and efficiency of the EPA’s action on the abandoned uranium mines. On March 31, 2012, The New York Times published an article entitled “Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous” by Leslie MacMillan. The article suggests that politics and money are influencing the prioritization of mine clean-up efforts. David Shafer, an <b>environmental</b> <b>manager</b> at the United States Department of Energy, has said that questions of whether current uranium problems are due to past mining or to the naturally occurring mineral are delaying the process of cleaning up. Similar concerns are common in environmental remediation projects for victims of industrial pollution. While the EPA does prioritize mines that are nearest to people’s homes, MacMillan highlights some remote locations where people do live and yet have been neglected by the EPA. Cameron, Arizona is one such site which has a population of nearly 1000. Rancher Larry Gordy stumbled across an abandoned uranium mine on his grazing land for his cattle near Cameron in the summer of 2010. There are still no warning signs in the town of Cameron to alert people of potential contamination.On December 30, 2010 Scientific American published an article entitled “Abandoned Uranium Mines: An ‘Overwhelming Problem’ in the Navajo Nation” by Francie Diep. Diep told Gordy’s story and reported that the EPA assessed his site on November 9, 2010. Diep suggested that this date was moved up due to publicity of Gordy’s story; originally the EPA had promised to visit within six months of his original discovery of the uranium mine. Similar allegations of prioritization due to negative publicity for the EPA were made of the Skyline Mine in the Oljato Mesa. Elsie Begay, a 71-year-old Navajo woman from the Oljato region was the topic of a series of articles in The Los Angeles Times in 2006. These articles were written by Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed (2010) author Judy Pasternak, whose work on these articles led to her book. One EPA representative, Jason Musante, stated this publicity “might have bumped the site up the priority list.”Now over a year after Gordy stumbled across the mine in his cattle’s grazing land, MacMillan reports that the site at Cameron has yet to be given a priority by the EPA. When EPA officials were asked to accompany a reporter to the Cameron site, the officials declined and instead offered to visit the newly cleaned site in Oljato. MacMillan spoke with a Navajo hotel manager near the Skyline Mine who expressed hesitation about the EPAs remediation, stating, “That’s what they want you to see: something that’s all nice and cleaned up.” MacMillan drew {{attention to the fact that}} cows are grazing on contaminated land and people are eating these cattle. Taylor McKinnon, a director at the Center for Biological Diversity, went so far as to say the site was the “worst he had seen in the Southwest.” Although the locally grown beef is tested, standard tests for meat do not include checking for radioactive substances like uranium. The EPA has put an emphasis on health effects throughout its five-year plan, so the lack of any sort of attention in this matter has raised eyebrows.In addition to the questioning of political bias in the prioritization of mining sites, there is criticism of the EPA’s decision to revisit a 1989 permit proposing to mine for uranium near Church Rock. New Mexico’s KUNM radio station reported on May 9, 2012 that Uranium Resources Incorporated has expressed interest in starting production near Church Rock by the end of 2013. An online petition has already gained nearly 10,000 signatures against this new mining initiative.|$|E
40|$|Whether {{realized}} {{or potential}} {{there are a}} multitude of goals that the <b>environmental</b> <b>manager</b> may be working toward achieving. This thesis evaluated the hypothesis that regardless of the operational goal(s) that the <b>environmental</b> <b>manager</b> may be working toward, {{the ultimate goal is}} to achieve ecological balance. This research defines ecological balance, with specific regard to a company 2 ̆ 7 s activities, as a stable and productive (rather than destructive) interrelationship of a company with its environment with regard to the contrasting, opposing, or interacting elements that are present {{as a result of the}} company 2 ̆ 7 s actions. This research defined five operational goals of the environmental manager: regulatory compliance, helping the company to reduce environmental costs, communicating environmental performance, helping the company to reduce environmental liability, and improving stakeholder support. The research conducted was aimed at uncovering any correlations between these five operational goals of the <b>environmental</b> <b>manager,</b> and the hypothesized ultimate goal of the <b>environmental</b> <b>manager.</b> In addition to a review of the literature in-depth interviews were conducted with eight environmental managers, and group workshops were held at three separate International Environmental Management Leadership symposia (RIT, Budapest, and Dubrovnik respectively) in order to collect data on the <b>environmental</b> <b>manager</b> 2 ̆ 7 s operational goals and the link between these goals and the existence of an ultimate or greater goal.
