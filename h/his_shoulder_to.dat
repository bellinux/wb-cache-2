5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
25|$|He is a {{right hand}} batsman known for his unorthodox {{technique}} and a right arm offspin bowler. He is credited as {{the inventor of the}} Marillier shot, in which the batsman extends the bat as a ramp {{in front of him and}} flicks the ball over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> fine leg. It is sometimes referred to as the Marillier.|$|E
25|$|He {{moved across}} to {{the first and third}} balls he {{received}} from McGrath and flicked them over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by one run. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes did win him respect, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E

25|$|On May 5, Halladay gave up nine earned runs in just 2 innings. The next day, Halladay {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list with a right shoulder injury. On May 8, it was announced that he would have surgery on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> have a bone spur removed. The surgery was also to address fraying of his labrum, and rotator cuff. Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin' Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.|$|E
25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
25|$|Pointing to the {{key role}} that Washington and his {{contacts}} played in the case, some point to the affair as a failure by W. E. B. DuBois and the NAACP. The inability of NAACP leaders to help Franklin has been compared with the case of Steve Greene in 1910 (shortly after the Franklin case). Greene fled with a bullet wound in <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> Chicago after killing an Arkansas farmer who tried to indenture or enslave Franklin on his farm. Greene was extradited to Arkansas, and was threatened with lynching. Ida B. Wells-Barnett's Negro Fellowship League raised money to organize a defense committee and safely bring Greene to Canada. Further, Washington was skeptical of legal solutions for Franklin in favor of political ones, a view that was ultimately validated. On the other hand, the NAACP saw Franklin's ultimate release as a success of their organization, and continues {{to claim that the}} case was their first case.|$|E

500|$|In June 1944, the {{men were}} {{transferred}} to Singapore aboard the SS Van Warwyck, renamed to the Harukiku Maru by the Japanese. Dogs were not allowed on board, but Frank Williams managed to teach Judy to lie still and silent inside a rice sack. When he boarded the ship, Judy climbed into a sack and Williams slung it over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> take on board. For three hours {{the men were}} forced to stand on deck in the searing heat, and for the entire time Judy remained still and silent in the bag on Wiliams's back. The conditions on board the ship were cramped with more than 700 prisoners. On 26 June 1944, the ship was torpedoed by HMS Truculent. Williams pushed Judy out of a porthole {{in an attempt to}} save her life, even though there was a [...] drop to the sea. He made his own escape from the ship, not knowing if Judy had survived. Over five hundred of the passengers did not survive.|$|E
500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] It was his job, with Davis looking over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>to</b> supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the narrative portrays Issachar himself as leading a godly and simple agricultural life. This is based on Genesis 49:14-15: Issachar had loved the land such that he [...] "bent <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> the burden" [...] and became a tiller for hire. The same exegesis is {{at work in the}} Septuagint and Samaritan Targum of Genesis.|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud {{argues that}} Issachar's {{description}} in the Blessing of Jacob - Issachar {{is a strong}} ass lying down between two burdens: and he saw that settled life was good, and the land was pleasant; and bowed <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> bear, and became a servant unto tribute - is {{a reference to the}} religious scholarship of the tribe of Issachar, though scholars feel that it may more simply be a literal interpretation of Issachar's name.|$|E

2500|$|His long {{association}} with the Reds ended with a substitute appearance in the 1996 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. [...] A hugely disappointing game looked to be heading for extra time and even a replay until Eric Cantona popped up with a late winner to give the Old Trafford side a 1–0 victory. Rush's last touch of the ball in a Liverpool shirt was when it bounced off <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> set Eric Cantona up for his winning goal.|$|E
2500|$|His {{movement}} in climbing was entirely his own. It contradicted all theory.

2500|$|In the video, it {{is clear}} that several Millsaps {{defenders}} stopped playing before the play was over. On the thirteenth lateral, Tomlin was taken down but tossed a no-look pitch over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> Hooten just before his knee hit the ground. Many Millsaps fans believed the play to be over and fireworks were shot off from behind the endzone in celebration. Maddux's final lateral hit the ground and bounced into Curry's hands. It appeared as though two defenders near Curry believed the play was over at that point, and Curry scampered into the endzone untouched. [...] Millsaps safety Michael Sims, the closest player to Curry when Curry caught the last lateral, later admitted that he turned around and started walking away, believing the game to be over.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shot was}} {{developed}} by Zimbabwean batsman Dougie Marillier. In a triangular tournament in Australia with Zimbabwe, Australia and West Indies, Zimbabwe played their final match with Australia and Marillier got a chance in the team. He could hardly have had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored 303 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 to win the match in the final over, {{which was to be}} bowled by Glenn McGrath. [...] Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath and flicked them over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by two runs. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Issachar {{was seen}} as being {{dominated}} by religious scholars; there is said {{by some to be}} an allusion to this in the Book of Chronicles—...from Issachar, men who understood the times, and knew what Israel ought to do ...—and if this is indeed an allusion to the tradition, then it would imply that the tradition was in existence by the time that the Book of Chronicles was compiled. In the Midrash, it is said that Issachar were the most influential in proselytism, and that Jewish religious scholars were either from the tribe of Levi or that of Issachar. Additionally, the Midrash argues that Issachar's description in the Blessing of Jacob—Issachar is a strong ass lying down between the sheepfolds: and he saw that settled life was good, and the land was pleasant; he put <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> the burden, and became a slave under forced labour—is a reference to the religious scholarship of the tribe of Issachar, rather than simply to a more literal interpretation of Issachar's name.|$|E
