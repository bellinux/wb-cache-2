25|$|All the {{handwriting}} recognition, speech recognition and pen & ink features from Windows XP Tablet PC Edition {{as well as}} accessories like Tablet PC <b>Input</b> <b>Panel,</b> Windows Journal, Sticky Notes and InkBall have been included. New features include gestures and pen flicks. There is intrinsic support for handwriting and ink, via the Ink Analysis API. A new control, the InkCanvas is made available by the API to add ink support to applications. Ink support can not only recognize handwriting and formatting, but also hand-drawn shapes which are converted to vector-graphics, rendered as the shape that {{was intended to be}} drawn. An update for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition containing Ink Analysis and StylusInput API support is also available. Windows Vista also supports handwriting personalization, which allows the recognizer to identify a user's handwriting. To improve recognition accuracy, users can correct individual characters or words, or submit handwritten samples; an opt in data collection feature is also available. Support for touchscreens is also included.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{inverter}} is {{a circuit}} for converting direct current to alternating current. The unique structure of multilevel inverters allows reaching high voltages with low harmonics {{without the use}} of transformers, filters or series connected synchronized switching devices. This paper aims at improving the output voltage performance of a solar fed fifteen level cascaded multilevel inverter with Proportional Integral and Artificial Neural Networks based Controllers. The gain of PI (Proportional Integral) controller is tuned to generate a reference signal to regulate a constant output voltage of 325 Vp. The proposed ANN (Artificial Neural Network) based controller is trained using Gradient Descent Back Propagation algorithm with various error signals and the obtained result is compared with conventional PI controller. The <b>input</b> solar <b>panel</b> with respect to variable irradiance is simulated in the MATLAB / Simulink. Thus by using the proposed system the output voltage of a solar fed cascaded multilevel inverter was maintained constant inspite of variations in the input...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Outcome Based Education (OBE) {{practice}} {{requires that}} the continual quality improvement (CQI) process is implemented in order to continuously {{improve the quality of}} teaching and learning of an education program. In purpose of implementing CQI processes, the inputs from the program stakeholders consist of external assessors, industry advisory panel (IAP), students as well as accreditation panel should be considered, weighted and implemented as deemed appropriate by the department. The program external assessors’ inputs also will determine the quality of the program's curriculum and contents as benchmarked with other top international universities. Thus, this paper describes the current CQI processes and self-initiated changes exercised by the Department of Electrical, Electronic and System Engineering, Faculty of Engineering & Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia based on the <b>inputs</b> from accreditation <b>panels,</b> industry advisory panels, external assessors and students which are gathered periodically by means of visits, meetings and discussions. The stakeholders’ and accreditation <b>panel</b> <b>inputs</b> are mainly on the aspects of teaching and learning, program objectives, program outcomes, curriculum structure, staff, student assessment, facilities and the system quality management as a whole. The department scrutinizes each input before appropriate CQI processes and changes are implemented.

It is highly affirmed that the continuous improvement process carried out at this department level has significantly improve students’ learning...|$|R

Generally speaking, a bank’s cost efficiency would be improved if the bank mergers happened between banks with different culture backgrounds. On the other hand, if the mergers happened between homogeneous banks, there would be little financial innovation and the cost efficiency would be unsubstantially improved. Another finding is that small banks have superior performance than larger banks in Taiwan. Also, efficiency would seem to dictate against merger mania. Copyright Springer 2005...|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of networking involves connecting several panels {{together to form}} a system. <b>Inputs</b> on one <b>panel</b> may activate outputs on another, for example, or the network may allow monitoring of many systems. Networking is often used in situations where one panel is not large enough, or in multiple-building situations. Networking is also an effective way to decouple systems {{to reduce the risk of}} a large portion of a facility going offline at any time due to system failure or maintenance requirements. Sub-Networks can be created using either hardware or software architectures. Networked systems normally are more costly and involve additional training and system configuration for successful implementation.|$|R

5000|$|During WinHEC 2004, Microsoft listed speech {{recognition}} {{as part of}} its [...] "Longhorn" [...] mobile PC strategy to improve productivity and listed microphone arrays as a hardware opportunity for the operating system. At WinHEC 2005, Microsoft released additional details pertaining to {{speech recognition}} in Windows Vista with a focus on accessibility, new mobility scenarios, and improvements to the speech user experience. Unlike the speech support included in Windows XP, which was integrated with the Tablet PC <b>Input</b> <b>Panel</b> and required switching between dictation and command modes, Windows Vista would separate the feature from the Tablet PC <b>Input</b> <b>Panel</b> by introducing a dedicated interface for speech input on the desktop and would also unify the previously separate dictation and command modes. In previous versions of Windows, speech recognition would not allow a user to speak a command after dictation or vice versa without first switching between these two modes. Microsoft also stated that speech recognition in Windows Vista would improve dictation accuracy, and support additional languages and microphone arrays. A demonstration of the feature at WinHEC 2005 focused on e-mail dictation with correction and editing commands, and a set of slides dedicated to microphone arrays was also released. Windows Vista Beta 1 would include an integrated speech recognition application. In an effort to persuade company employees to interact with Windows Speech Recognition during its development, Microsoft offered an opportunity to win a Premium model of its Xbox 360 video game console.|$|E
