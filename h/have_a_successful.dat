5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> performance review {{in order to}} get a raise. He makes elaborate posters, prepares a ridiculous speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) successfully prank him by making him believe that it is a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E
5|$|Since Liverpool's first {{competitive}} match, {{more than}} 700 players {{have made a}} competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Liverpool before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. The First and Second World Wars also disrupted the careers of footballers across the United Kingdom. Keith Burkinshaw only played one match for Liverpool but went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> managerial career at Tottenham Hotspur, where he won the FA Cup twice. Gordon Wallace, who made 22 appearances for the club, was the scorer of Liverpool's first goal in European competition. He scored the first goal in a 6–0 win over KR Reykjavik in the 1964–65 European Cup. Roy Evans made 11 appearances during his Liverpool career, and later managed the club from 1994 to 1998. The only trophy won during his tenure was the League Cup in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
5|$|Hechicero is {{the current}} NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Champion, having {{defeated}} Rey Bucanero for the championship on November 2, 2016. He is the sixth overall champion and the fifth individual to hold the title. Rey Bucanero is the only wrestler to have won the championship on two occasions and also holds the distinction of holding {{the record for the}} longest reign as his first reign with the championship lasted 714 days in total. The first champion, El Texano Jr., held the title for the shortest reign between August and December 2010, a total of 124 days. The championship has been vacated twice, first in 2011 when then-champion Shocker suffered a knee injury and was forced to give up the championship. In early 2015, CMLL vacated the championship once more, this time because champion Diamante Azul had not appeared at CMLL shows for several months. Current champion Hechicero was the first champion to defend the championship at a non-CMLL event as he defeated Caifan on November 27, 2016 in the main event of Lucha Memes Chairo 6 in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. Of all the champions El Texano Jr. and Shocker are the only champions to never <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> championship defense. Diamante Azul's 628 day reign from 2013 to 2015 saw Diamante Azul successfully defend the championship five times, the most of any champion.|$|E
