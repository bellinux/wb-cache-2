50|$|Ingber’s work on {{tensegrity}} led him {{to propose}} that mechanical forces play as {{an important role in}} biological control as chemicals and genes and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which cells convert mechanical signals into changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expression, a process known as ‘mechanotransduction’. Ingber determined that living cells use tensegrity architecture to stabilize their shape and cytoskeleton, that cellular integrins function as mechanosensors on the cell surface, and that cytoskeletal tension (or ‘prestress’, which is central to the stability of tensegrity structures) is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>regulator</b> of many cellular responses to mechanical cues. Ingber’s tensegrity theory also led to the prediction in the early 1980s that changes in extracellular matrix structure and mechanics play a fundamental role in tissue and organ development, and that deregulation of this form of developmental control can promote cancer formation.|$|E
50|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) is {{a family}} of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be {{activated}} by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate {{a wide variety of}} protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This kinase has been reported to play roles in many different cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, cell transformation, cell cycle checkpoint, and cell volume control. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this kinase may be a <b>fundamental</b> <b>regulator</b> of cardiac contractility and Ca2+ handling in myocytes.|$|E

40|$|How focal adhesions (FAs) convert {{retrograde}} filamentous actin (F-actin) {{flow into}} traction {{stress on the}} extracellular matrix to drive cell migration is unknown. Using combined traction force and fluorescent speckle microscopy, we observed a robust biphasic relationship between F-actin speed and traction force. F-actin speed is inversely related to traction stress near the cell edge where FAs are formed and F-actin motion is rapid. In contrast, larger FAs where the F-actin speed is low are marked by a direct relationship between F-actin speed and traction stress. We found that the biphasic switch is determined by a threshold F-actin speed of 8 – 10 nm/s, independent of changes in FA protein density, age, stress magnitude, assembly/disassembly status, or subcellular position induced by pleiotropic perturbations to Rho family guanosine triphosphatase signaling and myosin II activity. Thus, F-actin speed is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>regulator</b> of traction force at FAs during cell migration...|$|E

Their main role is to cluster synaptic vesicles (SVs) {{to each other and}} anchor them to the actin cytoskeleton to establish the reserve vesicle pool, and then release them in response to appropriate membrane depolarisation.

Replacement of endogenous SynIa with a non-SUMOylatable mutant decreases the size of the releasable vesicle pool and impairs stimulated SV exocytosis. SUMOylation enhances SynIa association with SVs to promote efficient reclustering of SynIa following neuronal stimulation and maintain its presynaptic localisation.

Podocyte foot processes of knockout mice developed structural defects, including mislocalization of the slit diaphragm. In the glomerulus, aPKCλ/ι was primarily expressed in developing glomerular epithelial cells and podocyte foot processes. Interestingly, under physiologic conditions, aPKCλ/ι translocated from the apical surface to the basolateral side of developing podocytes, and this translocation preceded the development of foot processes and formation of slit diaphragms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Selective {{leukocyte}} {{trafficking and}} recruitment is primarily regulated by a specific family of small proteins called "chemokines". This extended family shepherds and guides leukocytes through their lives, facilitating their development, regulating {{their interactions with}} other leukocyte types, and guiding their recruitment to sites of inflammation. Through the actions of chemokines, allergen sensitization is regulated in atopic asthma, through the controlled migration of dendritic cells, T- and B-lymphocytes, mast cells and basophils. Subsequently, atopic inflammation is driven by chemokine-directed recruitment of eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes. Diseases from cancer to {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} to interstitial fibrosis are all potential targets for chemokine receptor antagonism. Innate immunity (the early pattern-recognition responses to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, viral proteins and bacterial DNA) needs to bridge the gap to specific immunity and antibody production and immunological memory.
