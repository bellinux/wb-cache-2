40|$|Using a {{conjoint}} {{analysis with}} an hypothetical hiring process, in which managers chose repeatedly between two hypothetical candidates for a relevant vacancy, our study confirms that hiring probabilities decline with age, particularly {{after the age}} of 58. Several theoretical arguments are given for this, both from the economic and psychological literature. Estimation results point at three important mechanisms that may explain declining hiring probabilities with age: (1) Uncertainty about productivity levels of older <b>job-seekers</b> may cause risk averse employers to chose younger <b>job-seekers</b> with lower, but more certain productivity levels. All factors and policy measures that are informative about productivity levels and reduce uncertainty for employers, also increase the average hiring probability for older <b>job-seekers.</b> (2) Increasing labour costs compared to steady or declining productivity levels of older workers. Some of these costs are determined on a national level, but many are negotiated between employers and employees in central bargaining agreements. Employers themselves therefore have an important key to increase the attractiveness of older <b>job-seekers.</b> (3) Older managers hire more older <b>job-seekers,</b> {{the same is true for}} employers with an older workforce. It means that in an ageing society, the hiring probability of older <b>job-seekers</b> will increase, even if no additional policy measures are taken. The effect of this ageing is stronger than any of the policy measures analysed in our study...|$|R

5000|$|In 1919 Würzbach {{founded the}} Nietzsche Society in Munich. Other members soon {{included}} writers and intellectuals such as Thomas Mann and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Many European academics {{of the time}} perceived a kindred soul in Friedrich Nietzsche and saw identified with his cultural criticism. Würzbach's first publication in 1921 was a treatise on Dionysus which rehashed certain elements of Nietzsche's thoughts on the Manichean rivalry of Apollonian and Dionysian forces within cultures. Apart from his doctoral thesis published 1924,where he offered an eccentric theory on prehistoric artifacts and tools, his subsequent career was almost exclusively dedicated to his interpretation of Nietzsche. [...] Throughout the 1920s, Würzbach, along with Richard and Max Oehler, worked on the Musarion Editions of Nietzsche's Complete Works. According to a self-penned resume in 1934, and his later mercy-plea to Hitler in 1940, he gave a number oflectures railing against the [...] "Jewish philosopher Edmund Husserl". He claimed to have given lectures {{on the subject of}} Husserl in Berlin ‘25, Freiburg ‘26, Basel ‘26, Paris ‘26, Riga ‘28. Whether in fact these lectures dealt with Husserl in an anti-Semitic manner, as his resume suggests, or whether this was simply the boastings of a pragmatic <b>job-seeker</b> has not yet been established. One thing is certain however, during the 1920s Würzbach drifted toward certain readings of Nietzsche, and philosophy in general, which leaned toward the ultra-nationalist Nazi Weltanschauung which would emerge triumphant in Germany of the ‘30s. It was at the 1924 International Philosophy Congress in Naples where Würzbach first aired his view that philosophers were determined by their race. Thereby, Kant and others were not just [...] "philosophical Germans, but Germanic philosophers". He was to use this racial argument on numerous occasions throughout his career.|$|E
30|$|A smaller {{literature}} quantified {{effects of}} hiring subsidies and {{job creation schemes}} on the entire labour market or was concerned with deadweight loss, substitution or displacement effects. These studies worked with regional or company data and mainly suitable (dynamic) panel regression methods. One of the main outcomes that they take into account is a <b>job-seeker</b> rate that does not only consider unemployed people as job-seekers but also participants in ALMPs, who are often not registered as unemployed in official statistics. The key reason for this choice is to avoid bookkeeping effects, as unemployed people entering ALMPs would automatically reduce the unemployment rate but not the <b>job-seeker</b> rate. When modelling {{the effects of the}} intensity of a labour market programme on the <b>job-seeker</b> rate with regional data for instance, the models have to allow for lagged dependent variables and need to take into account a simultaneity problem. The <b>job-seeker</b> rate is affected by the programme intensity. Yet the programme’s intensity results from a policy reaction function that depends on the <b>job-seeker</b> rate. To resolve the related identification problems differenced Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators (Arellano and Bond 1991), system GMM estimators (Blundell and Bond 1998), or a transformed Maximum Likelihood Estimator (Hsiao et al. 2002) are often applied. Moreover, some studies address the issue that job-seekers not only search in their own but also in neighbouring regions. In turn the methods need to take regional correlation into account.|$|E

For these reasons some studies aimed at determining effects of {{the intensity of the}} programme on the matching efficiency by considering its effects on the regular hiring rate and more general in a Beveridge Curve framework on the <b>job-seeker</b> rate, using regional labour market panel data 4. The studies by Hujer et al. (20042006) used a Beveridge Curve framework for the period of the first quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2001.

The findings from a fixed effects regression for the East are no different in qualitative terms.

40|$|Mature-aged {{unemployment}} and underemployment are serious concerns in Australia, and policies {{designed to increase}} mature-aged workforce participation have been largely unsuccessful. The aim {{of the present study}} was to see if <b>job-seekers</b> and employers had differing perceptions of the relative importance of work-related skills and attributes, since this could be a factor in the poor success rate of older <b>job-seekers.</b> It consisted of a questionnaire survey of 143 mature-aged <b>job-seekers</b> (aged from 45 years and over) and 42 employers from a range of sizes and types of organisations. The results showed that the <b>job-seekers</b> and employers agreed that the three most important attributes for finding employment were reliability, punctuality, and competence. There were significant differences on nine out of 32 attributes, but these were not rated as among the most important by either group. While older jobseekers did nominate age-related factors as barriers to their re-employment, they did not rate them as highly as other factors. More importantly, employers did not nominate age-related factors as barriers to the re-employment of older jobseekers. It was concluded that age incongruence between employers and mature aged <b>job-seekers</b> could be a factor in mature aged unemployment, although there may be a case for further research to see if employers do, indeed, act in ways consistent with their stated positions.

40|$|Industrial-organizational {{psychologist}} Stephen S. W. Gilliland {{developed a}} model for studying <b>job-seeker</b> fairness perceptions in 1993 based on existing research in organizational justice. The model includes several rules which will result in <b>job-seeker</b> perceptions of fairness if satisfied and <b>job-seeker</b> perceptions of unfairness if violated. Given the prominence of this model in the literature as well as changes which have occurred in personnel selection (such as human resource information systems, or HRIS, and e-recruitment), scholars {{have called for a}} technological re-envisioning of the original model, especially the explanations/descriptions ascribed to each rule. The present study seeks to understand how HRIS e-recruitment technology impacts <b>job-seeker</b> fairness perceptions and in so doing update the Gilliland (1993) model using a qualitative methodology and website success measures from information systems success theory. It contributes to the literature on applicant fairness perceptions by accounting for technological change, and contributes to the field of Public Administration by studying a governmental e-recruitment portal thereby accounting for the particularities of public-sector HRM which is underrepresented in the organizational justice literature. Over the course of one (1) year, twelve (12) job-seekers participated in a series of focus group interviews where they reflected on their experiences applying for jobs in the Canadian federal civil service using the government’s e-recruitment portal. Participants completed profiles, sent applications, communicated with government personnel, and wrote internet tests, among other job-search activities, and reported on their experiences from the perspective of fairness. Results confirm the validity of all original procedural justice rules and offer insight into their application in a recruitment environment where applicants invest considerable time interacting with computerized systems. Two additional rules are also put forth including the ease with which candidates can deceive tests and privacy/trustworthiness using technology.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of active {{labour market policies}} (ALMP) at the macroeconomic level measures net effects on labour market outcomes.
