The fatigue {{property}} tests {{have been carried}} out for the <b>forging</b> steel of <b>grade</b> E and the casting steel of grade E by using the up and down method and grouping method in the paper. The two kinds of steel’s fatigue limits have been obtained with the up and down method. With the grouping method, the P-S-N curve equations of high-cycle fatigue have been obtained. The confidence level is 90 % and the probabilities of failure are 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 %. The test results show that the fatigue property of the forging material are superior to the casting apparently. To some extent, the test results are valuable for fatigue reliability designating of train coupler...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{induction}} Directional Solidification System (i-DSS) is {{a furnace}} designed to cast solar <b>grade</b> silicon <b>ingots</b> that {{makes use of}} induction heating in the Directional Solidification process {{for the production of}} multi-crystal silicon. The isostatic graphite, that envelopes the quartz crucible where the silicon is melted, is heated by induction, so in i-DSS the isostatic graphite acts as susceptor. The Alternative Magnetic Field (AMF), which frequency and intensity have been chosen in order to maximize the efficiency of the heating, is not completely shielded by the graphite and it affects the flow of silicon fluid. In this paper, the fluid motion is investigated taking into account various position of the solidification front. The study is applied to the lab-scale i-DSS installed at Laboratory of Electroheat (LEP) of University of Padova. The electromagnetic and fluid problems have been studied by numerical models developed using the commercial FEM code COMSOL Multiphysics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{compensated}} silicon (Si) {{is used in}} photovoltaic (PV) processes, {{whether it}} is through intentional co-doping of resistivity-adjusted Czochralski ingots for high efficiency n-type Si solar cells, {{as a result of}} alternative Si purification processes for the production of low-cost Si feedstock, or as a result of recycling end-of-life materials. Whatever the origin of the compensated Si, the doping concentrations need to be accurately and quickly characterized in order to control such processes. In this work, a rapid and highly sensitive characterization technique based on low temperature Hall Effect measurements is described in scientific details and compared to three well-established chemical methods: Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS), Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). The characterized samples were extracted from the n-type top part of a casted solar <b>grade</b> Si <b>ingot.</b> A very good agreement is observed between the dopants densities extracted from the electrical method and from the standard methods.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} heating power of the {{electric}} arc furnace (EAF), precise end point control of the EAF refining process is essential for efficient melt processing. The evolution of the steel bath temperature was measured during the EAF refining phase using a novel fibre optical measurement system based on BFI’s DynTemp® technique. This measurement system was applied at the high productivity furnace of Ferriere Nord producing construction steels and the furnace of Saarschmiede Freiformschmiede producing high quality <b>forging</b> steel <b>grades.</b> The continuous liquid steel temperature measurements were also used to optimize the performance of dynamic EAF process models. The model validation by conventional thermocouple measurements proved that the liquid steel temperature can be predicted with a modelling error standard deviation of about 11  K for the Ferriere Nord furnace and of about 20  K for Saarschmiede furnace. In addition, to interpret the measurement results, the processes of both steel shops were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Fluid flow and steel bath temperature distribution were modelled to determine optimal measurement time, minimum measurement duration, and influence of the measurement position. Based on {{the analysis of the}} liquid steel temperature evolution, more reliable set points for energy input and temperature control are determined.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} light induced {{degradation}} on small lab-type 2 x 2 cm 2 solar cells made from standard p-type mc-Si material {{is compared to}} the degradation of lowly compensated UMG material {{on the one hand}} and intentionally Fe and Fe/Cu contaminated material (several ppma of Fe or Fe and Cu are introduced into the melt of electronic <b>grade</b> feedstock before <b>ingot</b> casting) on the other hand. The material is taken from three different ingot heights (bottom, middle and top), respectively. All cells are annealed at 200 °C in the dark for several minutes before they are exposed to one sun illumination and the development of the electrical parameters over time is determined. The reference and UMG material behave as expected and show a degradation which is correlated to the boron and interstitial oxygen concentration over the ingot height and therefore can be attributed to B-O related defects. The intentionally Fe and Cu contaminated samples in contrast show a degradation behavior that is more probably correlated to the distribution of the Fe and Cu contamination, as the absolute degradation towards the top of the ingot is higher for highly contaminated material (20 ppma Fe) than in the reference material and the observed time constants for degradation are different. Fe/Cu contaminated material exhibits too low cell performance in the top and bottom part of the ingot to show any significant degradation effects. The lowly contaminated material (2 ppma Fe) behaves like the reference material as long as the wafer material does not contain additional contaminants originating from the crucible walls. Material from near the crucible wall by contrast shows a stronger light induced degradation...|$|R
5000|$|The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued {{requirements}} in 2005 {{for a new}} [...]45 ACP service pistol and requested interested firearms manufacturers to submit models for field trial testing. With a large U.S. government defense contract {{for as many as}} 650,000 pistols and related accessories in the balance, Taurus was one of many companies to respond, submitting an upgraded 24/7 design they dubbed the ‘OSS’ model. When the USSOCOM request was at first delayed, and eventually indefinitely shelved, Taurus decided to offer its submission to the civilian marketplace where it garnered much attention and popularity, eventually winning the National Rifle Association (NRA) Handgun of the Year award in 2005. The OSS models feature a 5.25 inch match <b>grade</b> <b>forged</b> barrel [...] and a 3 position safety system - the bottom position enables the pistol to fire, the middle setting puts it in 'safe' condition, and the upper decocks the striker. This arrangement results in several carry options for the user as the gun can be carried with a round in the chamber ‘cocked and locked’ in ‘Condition one’ (striker cocked with safety on), or the arguably safer ‘Condition Two’ (striker decocked and safety off, requiring a revolver-like DA pull to both cock and fire the pistol), or even with the striker decocked and the safety on. The OSS retains the loaded chamber indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked.|$|R
40|$|As the {{production}} of solar cell silicon evolves and new concepts are introduced, {{the need for a}} more complete understanding of the basic principles of silicon solidification is also increasing. Nucleation has previously been studied under near homogeneous conditions in elevated drop experiments, but {{little is known about the}} nucleation mechanisms and initial growth of silicon in silicon nitride coated crucibles. The motivation behind this study was to learn more about which nucleation mechanisms are dominant during the solidification of multicrystalline silicon, and which factors are controlling grain size and orientation. The work was divided into four separate experimental stages: • Wetting experiments • Nucleation experiments on droplets • In-situ experiments • Small scale directional solidification experiments The first part of the study investigated wetting behavior of liquid silicon on silicon nitride coated silica with variations in oxygen concentration of the coating. It was shown that the wetting angle increased with increasing oxygen concentration. The nucleation undercooling of silicon droplets was studied as a function of substrate coating roughness, thickness, oxygen concentration and substrate material in a sessile drop wetting furnace. The results showed that the undercooling for silicon was not dependent on any of the variations in coating properties, only by changes in substrate material. In-situ experiments were performed to study the growth rate and grain size as a function of cooling rate (10 and 30 K/min), variation in coating structure, and silicon feedstock grade. Two grades of silicon were used, a pure electronic grade and a compensated silicon with a carbon concentration of 19 ppmw. The growth rate and grain size were only affected by changes in cooling rate. A high cooling rate increased both growth rate and the number of grains nucleating. The coating structure and impurity variation did not alter neither growth rate nor grain size. A last set of experiments was performed in a small scale Bridgman solidification furnace. Solidification rate and silicon <b>grade</b> were investigated. <b>Ingots</b> were solidified with two different rates, and pulled out of the hot zone with the speed of 0. 2 and 50 mm/min. The nucleation temperature was measured for the fastest solidified ingots. It was shown that the increased carbon content in compensated silicon, as compared to polysilicon, does not affect the grain size or orientation in the bottom of the ingot. It was also shown that the slowly solidified ingots had a similar grain size to the dendrite-like microstructure in the bottom of the fast solidified ingot. This indicates that it is the initial growth process, rather than nucleation, that needs to be controlled in order to obtain larger grains in the multicrystalline ingot. It was found that silicon nitride coating structural properties are not dominant in controlling grain size or orientation. It is suggested that the particle size in the coating itself is too small to influence nucleation, but that Si 3 N 4 -particles precipitated from the silicon melt have both the size and lattice match which enables nucleation. Grain size and orientation are affected by cooling rate, but the growth mechanisms in the initial stages of solidification are also determining the microstructure of the ingot. These mechanisms should therefore be further investigated. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Grade 4 {{titanium}} is {{a commercially}} pure grade titanium alloy extensively used in various industries including {{the chemical industry}} and more recently in the biomedical industry. Grade 4 has found a niche as a biomedical material for production of components such as orthopaedic and dental implants. Its physical properties such as high corrosion resistance, low thermal conductivity and high strength make it suitable for these applications. These properties also make it hard-to-machine similar to the other grades of titanium alloys and other metals such as nickel based alloys. During machining of titanium, elevated temperatures are generated at the tool-workpiece interface due to its low thermal conductivity. Its high strength is also maintained at these high temperatures. These tend to impair the cutting tool affecting its machinability. Various investigations on other grades of titanium and other hard-to-machine materials have shown that machining at high cutting speeds may improve certain aspects of their machinability. High speed machining (HSM) is used to improve productivity in the machining process and to therefore lower manufacturing costs. HSM may, however, change the surface integrity of the machined material. Surface integrity refers to {{the properties of the}} surface and sub-surface of a machined component which may be quite different from the substrate. The properties of the surface and sub-surface of a component may have a marked effect on the functional behaviour of a machined component. Fatigue life and wear are examples of properties that may be significantly influenced by a change in the surface integrity. Surface integrity may include the topography, the metallurgy and various other mechanical properties. It is evaluated by examination of surface integrity indicators. In this investigation the three main surface integrity indicators are examined. These are surface roughness, sub-surface hardness and residual stress. White layer thickness and chip morphology were also observed as results of the machining process used. The effect of HSM on the surface integrity of grade 4 is largely unknown. This investigation therefore aims to address this limitation by conducting an experimental investigation on the effect of HSM on selected surface integrity indicators for <b>grade</b> 4. Two <b>forged</b> bars of <b>grade</b> 4 alloy were machined using a CNC lathe at two depths of cut, 0. 2 mm and 1 mm. Each bar was machined at varying cutting speeds ranging from 70 m/min to 290 m/min at intervals of approximately 20 m/min. Machined samples were prepared from these cutting speeds and depths of cut. The three surface integrity indicators were then evaluated with respect to the cutting speed and depth of cut (DoC). iv Results show that a combination of intermediate cutting speeds and low DoC may have desirable effects on the surface integrity of grade 4. Highest compressive stresses were obtained when machining with these conditions. High compressive stresses are favourable in cases where the fatigue life of a material {{is an important factor in}} the functionality of a component. Subsurface hardening was noticed at 0. 2 mm DoC, with no subsurface softening at all cutting speeds. Surface hardness higher than the bulk hardness tends to improve the wear resistance of the machined material. Though surface roughness values for all depths of cut were below the standard fine finish of 1. 6 μm, roughness values of samples machined at 0. 2 mm DoC continued to decrease with increase in cutting speed. Low surface roughness values may also influence the improvement of fatigue life of the machined components. These machining conditions, (intermediate cutting speeds and low DoC), seem to have promoted mechanically dominated deformation during machining rather than thermal dominated deformation. Thermal dominated deformation was prominent on titanium machined at DoC of 1 mm...|$|R
