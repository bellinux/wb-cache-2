5|$|On April 16, 2010, the {{day prior}} to the annual Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey, B.C., one of the parade {{organizers}} issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade, their safety could not be guaranteed. This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that is banned in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Abarca and Pineda, another person {{was arrested by}} the authorities that day in Santa María Aztahuacán, Iztapalapa. Federal agents stated that the individual was Noemí Berumen Rodríguez, who was believed to have aided the couple in their hiding by lending them her house. She {{is a friend of}} the couple's 25-year-old daughter Yazareth Liz Abarca Pineda, who was taken into custody along with her parents. However, Yazareth was only considered an eye-witness and does not face criminal charges. Authorities were able to link Berumen with the Abarcas due to her friendship with Yazareth and her presence on social media. They discovered that Yazareth <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> with a friend that lived in Iztapalapa, who followed Berumen online.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} her son Kwame was very ill. The {{following}} month, Queen Elizabeth II made her {{first visit to}} Ghana. While inspecting the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and President Nkrumah passed by the boy's bed. Since he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of his parents displayed on his bedside table, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had visited Kumasi previously and had met Peggy Appiah, turned back, as he was leaving, to send his regards. President Nkrumah's reported anger at being embarrassed in this way -this was the husband of a foreign head of state sending a greeting to {{the wife of a}} man Nkrumah had in political detention – was reportedly {{one of the reasons that}} Kwame Appiah's doctor was deported.|$|E

2500|$|Most sources {{question}} whether Crazy Horse was ever photographed. Dr. McGillycuddy doubted any {{photograph of the}} war leader had been taken. In 1908, Walter Camp wrote to the agent for the Pine Ridge Reservation inquiring about a portrait. [...] "I {{have never seen a}} photo of Crazy Horse," [...] Agent Brennan replied, [...] "nor am I able to find any one among our Sioux here who remembers having seen a picture of him. Crazy Horse had left the hostiles but a short time before he was killed and it's more than likely he never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> taken of himself." ...|$|E

[...] In one extreme example Pollack noted that at one point Al Jazeera English <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Saudi troops headed across the causeway connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain while Al Jazeera Arabic ran a completely different headline proclaiming [...] "Bahrain's Government Rejects Foreign Intervention" [...] — alluding to a rejection Iranian interference.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{has spoken}} highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it {{possibly}} the best {{car in the}} world, and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti {{through a number of}} challenges to support his point. Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, [...] "Cameron Diaz on wheels". Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, [...] "It's like they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of me on their desk and said [...] 'Let's build that bloke a car!'" [...] and [...] "I can't believe it... I've fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!" [...] Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being [...] "back-breakingly marvellous". Clarkson considers the Lexus LFA as the best car he has ever driven.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 {{with the}} backing of Dorothy Perkins and British Land, the store moved to the seven-storey Derry & Toms {{department}} store, which immediately attracted up to a million customers weekly, {{making it one of the}} most visited tourist attractions in London. There were different departments, and each floor had its own theme, such as a children's floor, a floor for men, a book store, a food market, and a [...] "home" [...] floor which sold items such as wallpaper, paint, cutlery, soft furnishings and even statues. The overall design was produced by Whitmore-Thomas Partnership, run by artist/designers Steve Thomas (artist) and Tim Whitmore.Each department had its own logo or sign, which was based on the Biba logo and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> describing the department.

2500|$|In May 1998, India {{conducted}} five {{nuclear tests}} at the Pokharan range in Rajasthan. Earlier a staunch supporter of nuclear disarmament, Fernandes openly endorsed the NDA government's decision {{to test the}} nuclear bombs. He was also involved in skirmishes with the then Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy, Vishnu Bhagwat, over promotion of Vice-Admiral Harinder Singh as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. Bhagwat was subsequently sacked over the issue. After the Tehelka defence scandal broke out in March 2001, Fernandes quit as defence minister, but was reappointed to the post later. Fernandes {{has been the only}} defence minister of a nuclear power who has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Hiroshima bombing in his office. He has made 18 visits to the icy heights of the [...] Siachen glacier in Kashmir, which holds the record of being [...] "the world's highest battlefield". He was known for overseeing a huge increase in India's defence budget as compared to the allocations made by previous governments.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{majority}} {{does not}} rest its decision today on any {{finding that the}} statements at issue explicitly state a false and defamatory fact. Nor could it," [...] wrote Justice Brennan in his dissent. He and Justice Marshall agreed with the lower courts that there was sufficient indication that the column was opinion to protect it as such: {{it was on the}} sports page, it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the author with [...] "TD Says" [...] in it, and in the text itself, [...] "Diadiun not only reveals the facts upon which he is relying, but he makes it clear at which point he runs out of facts and is simply guessing." [...] He notes that Diadiun used [...] "apparently" [...] when referring to Milkovich and Scott's testimony in Columbus and that no one could take [...] "knows in his heart" [...] as a statement of literal fact, as it is inherently hyperbolic. [...] "Readers could see that Diadiun was focused on the court's reversal of the OHSAA's decision, and was angrily supposing what must have led to it," [...] he concluded. Citing several recent historical incidents where many commentators had speculated as to what had occurred with much less complete knowledge of the facts, he said [...] "conjecture is a means of fueling a national discourse on such questions and stimulating public pressure for answers from those who know more ... Punishing (it) protects reputation only at the cost of expunging a genuinely useful mechanism for public debate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deck {{specifically}} {{claimed that}} his rights to due process, prescribed by the 5th and 14th Amendments, were violated. Deck’s counsel {{made it clear}} that there was no reason such as a court disturbance to permit such shackling. In Deck’s argument to the Supreme Court, it was also argued that Deck’s 6th Amendment rights had been violated {{on the grounds of the}} Confrontation Clause. Deck’s shackling told the jury that Deck was a dangerous person and was shackled to protect the people in the courtroom. Therefore, the jury <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in their mind that Deck was an awful person. Deck’s attorneys referred to this idea as prejudice towards Deck. Deck’s counsel argued that this meant that the jury was influenced by arbitrary details in deciding Deck’s sentence, not just the presented facts. [...] It was made clear that Deck could not cross-examine or defend against the idea of bias and prejudice against him. As a result his right to confront witnesses as stated in the 6th Amendment (as well as idea of an impartial jury) was violated by the shackles. Also, Deck’s counsel argued that the shackles violated the defendant's rights that “give meaning to the defendant’s right to be present at his trial.” [...] It was argued that the shackles limited Deck from freely conversing with his counsel, and that they prevented him from taking the stand to defend himself. The defense wrote that this would increase the chances of Deck being sentenced to death by the jury which made the shackling unconstitutional.|$|E

2500|$|In {{attempting}} to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated {{the number of}} murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; {{but no one can}} go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: [...] "Mr. John Taylor-We will give you one week to go, but if you are alive on next Saturday you will die." [...] Another, to three bosses, charged with [...] "cheating thy men" [...] <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, [...] "This is your home." [...] In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he would ever see wife and children again.|$|E
