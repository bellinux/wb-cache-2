5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm whales sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the SSRI, {{even though this is}} not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, {{commonly referred to as}} seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> any signals, they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> any bridge-to-bridge calls, they (the USS Thunderbolt) felt there was no choice except to fire the warning shots." ...|$|R
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> any available therapy, and no treatment {{has been approved}} specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
25|$|Plasmapheresis {{can be an}} {{effective}} treatment when attacks progress or <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> corticosteroid treatment. Clinical trials for these treatments contain very small numbers, and most are uncontrolled, though some report high success percentage.|$|E

25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> IV steroids within 7–10 days {{should be considered}} for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine {{at a rate of}} 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E
