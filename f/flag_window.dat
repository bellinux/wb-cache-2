With the <b>flag</b> set, <b>Windows</b> would not invalidate sibling child windows underneath (in the z-order) other [...] child windows. The main reason for the flag was applications such as Lotus Notes 2.1, which implemented its own combo boxes as child windows, rather than as top-level windows (the system default combo box implementation). With this flag set, odd display problems with such windows would disappear.|$|R

Normally Windows 3.1 tries to print both in a single band.

Freelance Graphics had a similar problem.|$|R
25|$|Rarely {{used because}} of its {{outdated}} nature, window scanning is fairly untrustworthy in determining whether a port is opened or closed. It generates the same packet as an ACK scan, but checks whether the window field of the packet has been modified. When the packet reaches its destination, a design flaw attempts to create a window size for the packet if the port is open, <b>flagging</b> the <b>window</b> field of the packet with 1's before it returns to the sender. Using this scanning technique with systems that no longer support this implementation returns 0's for the window field, labeling open ports as closed.|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetotelluric method}} employs {{co-located}} surface measurements of electric and magnetic fields to infer the local electrical {{structure of the}} earth. The frequency-dependent 'apparent resistivity' curves can be inaccurate at long periods if input data are contaminated - even when robust remote reference techniques are employed. Data despiking prior to processing can result in significantly more reliable estimates of long period apparent resistivities. This paper outlines a two-step method of automatic identification and replacement for spike-like contamination of magnetotelluric data; based on the simultaneity of natural electric and magnetic field variations at distant sites. This simultaneity is exploited both to identify windows in time when the array data are compromised, and to generate synthetic data that replace observed transient noise spikes. In the first step, windows in data time series containing spikes are identified via intersite comparison of channel 'activity' - such as the variance of differenced data within each window. In the second step, plausible data for replacement of <b>flagged</b> <b>windows</b> is calculated by Wiener filtering coincident data in clean channels. The Wiener filters - which express the time-domain relationship between various array channels - are computed using an uncontaminated segment of array training data. Examples are shown where the algorithm is applied to artificially contaminated data, and to real field data. In both cases all spikes are successfully identified. In the case of implanted artificial noise, the synthetic replacement time series {{are very similar to}} the original recording. In all cases, apparent resistivity and phase curves obtained by processing the despiked data are much improved over curves obtained from raw data...|$|R
5000|$|Sacheverell's {{sentence}} expired on 23 March 1713. The {{reaction in}} London was muted {{compared to the}} celebrations in the provincial towns such as Worcester, Norwich, Wells and Frome where the steeples were decked with <b>flags,</b> <b>windows</b> were decorated with streamers along with bonfires and people singing in the streets. On 29 March Sacheverell preached at St Saviour's {{for the first time}} since his ban expired and the enormous crowd who came to see him was described as [...] "inconceivable to those who did not see it, and inexpressible to those who did". He took as his text Luke 23:34, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" [...] and titled it The Christian Triumph: or The Duty of Praying for our Enemies. Despite the provocative title, as White Kennett wrote, [...] "there was little mischief in it" [...] and it sold only half the 30,000 copies printed. Jonathan Swift called it a [...] "long dull sermon". On 13 April 1713 it was announced he was to be instituted to the valuable rectory of St Andrew's, Holborn. On 29 May 1713 he was appointed to preach the sermon for the anniversary of the Restoration at the House of Commons, titled False Notions of Liberty in Religion and Government destructive of both. He attacked his Whig persecutors as [...] "traitorous, heady and high-minded men" [...] and upheld the doctrine of non-resistance. In December 1713 he preached at St Paul's to the Corporation for the Sons of the Clergy but his procession was hissed by the crowd at the Royal Exchange.|$|R
50|$|The flag is {{a symbol}} of Gibraltarian nationalism, and is very popular among Gibraltarians.

5000|$|Force extra windows words:This is bit #8 of the {{compatibility}} bits word, with {{hexadecimal value}} , {{known by the}} symbolic name [...] in [...] This flag works around a problem with applications that assumed the existence of window words (extra items of data associated by Windows with GUI windows) when they had not in fact informed Windows that extra window words were required. Windows 3.1, unlike Windows 3.0, bounds checks all uses of extra window words, and applications that assumed that they could use more space than they had asked for would thus fail.

5000|$|Support {{multiple}} printing bands:This is bit #5 of the compatibility bits word, with hexadecimal value , {{known by the}} symbolic name [...] in [...] This <b>flag</b> causes <b>Windows</b> 3.1 to always use multiple bands for printing, even when one band would be sufficient. This was to work around a problem in Freelance Graphics, which would assume that if only one band existed, {{and it was the}} entire page, it was the text band, and would not even attempt to print graphics. On Windows 3.1, the universal printer driver would sometimes be able to handle both text and graphics with a single band. By forcing the use of multiple bands, the problems that this would cause for Freelance Graphics were avoided.|$|R

5000|$|In Germany, [...] "national pride" [...] ("Nationalstolz") {{is often}} {{associated}} with the former Nazi regime. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national <b>flag</b> from <b>windows,</b> as the team progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation. By the time the semi-final against Italy came around, the level of national pride and unity was at its highest throughout the tournament, and the hosting of the World Cup is seen to have been a great success for Germany as a nation. After the World Cup, however, the subject of patriotism became again as difficult as it had been before.|$|R
5000|$|Don't enum device fonts:This is bit #14 of the {{compatibility}} bits word, with {{hexadecimal value}} , {{known by the}} symbolic name [...] in [...] This <b>flag</b> causes <b>Windows</b> 3.1 to turn the [...] flag off in particular circumstances when an application that is wanting to print enumerates fonts. The particular circumstances are when the target printer is not either a dot matrix printer or a PostScript printer, and the fonts are TrueType fonts that are not resident in the printer itself. In such circumstances, some applications (including PageMaker and MGXDraw) misinterpret the flag and believe the font to be device-resident. (TrueType fonts can be uploaded by Windows to printers, and need not be resident on the device itself to be usable.) They then query the printer to see what sizes of the font it supports, and when that fails (because the printer doesn't know about the font until it is uploaded), they incorrectly assume that the font cannot be resized. Setting the [...] flag to false in such situations prevents the applications from going wrong, {{and that is what}} this compatibility bitflag does.|$|R
