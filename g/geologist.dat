5000|$|<b>Geologists</b> Day is a {{professional}} holiday of <b>geologists,</b> geophysicists and geochemists. It is traditionally celebrated on the first Sunday of April.

5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught <b>geologist.</b> His 1841 {{publication}} The Old Red Sandstone {{became a}} bestseller.

The next century {{was a period of}} thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS <b>geologist</b> and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E

5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and <b>geologist,</b> who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a <b>geologist,</b> researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
