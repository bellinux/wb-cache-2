25|$|Economic development, however, {{was only}} a part of Garcia Moreno’s plan for the new Ecuador; he above all sought to remake the nation into a shining example of a Catholic state. Garcia Moreno, while abroad, had {{witnessed}} the violence and chaos, as well as the uprooting of the Church’s spiritual authority, which revolutionary liberalism brought in the Revolutions of 1848, As a result, he became further committed to Catholic principles. The new constitution Garcia Moreno drafted in 1861 increased presidential power to allow for this, and his 1862 concordat with the Church gave it more power over Ecuador it has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>before</b> or since. Catholicism, in a new 1869 constitution, was made the state religion as well as the only legal faith. Garcia Moreno further strengthened the Church’s interests that same year by signing into effect legislation which outlawed secret societies such as the Freemasons, which those on the receiving end saw as a personal attack.|$|E
25|$|Soon the Balkan rebellions were {{beginning}} to falter. In Europe, papers were filled with reports of Ottoman soldiers killing thousands of Slavs. Even in Great Britain William Ewart Gladstone published his account of Ottoman atrocities in his Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Soon, a new Russo-Turkish war had begun. Despite fighting better than they <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> the advanced Ottoman armies still were not equal to the Russian forces. This time there was no help from abroad, in truth many European nations supported the Russian war, {{as long as it}} did not get too close to Istanbul. Ten and a half months later when the war had ended the age of Ottoman domination over the Balkans was over. The Ottomans had fought well, the new navy of Ironclads had won the battle for the Black Sea, and Russian advances in the Caucasus had been kept minimal. In the Balkans, however, the Russian army, supported by rebels, had pushed the Ottoman army out of Bulgaria, Romania, and much of East Rumelia {{and by the end of}} the war the artillery firing in Thrace could be heard in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{mounted a}} {{comeback}} {{in the bottom}} of the seventh, when Espinosa led off with a walk and pinch-hitter Chris Heisey followed with a two-run homer off reliever Grant Dayton to cut the Dodgers′ lead to 4-3. When first baseman Clint Robinson followed immediately with a single, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the unconventional move of bringing in closer Kenley Jansen to pitch in the seventh inning, something Jansen had not done since 2013. Although the Nats put pressure on Jansen, with Harper singling and Murphy intentionally walked to load the bases, Jansen struck out Rendon for the third out to preserve the Dodgers' lead. Jansen pitched into the ninth inning without giving up another hit, throwing 51 pitches – nine more than he <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>before.</b> When Jansen tired {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, walking Harper and Werth with one out, Roberts made another unconventional move, bringing Clayton Kershaw - who had started Game 1 and, on short rest, Game 4 – in for the first save of his career. Kershaw got Murphy to pop out for the second out, and, with no one else left on the bench to face Kershaw, Baker sent rookie Wilmer Difo to the plate. Kershaw struck out the overmatched Difo to preserve a 4-3 win and give Los Angeles a 3-2 series victory. The Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs in the NLDS for the third time in five years, and the Dodgers advanced to face the Chicago Cubs in the 2016 National League Championship Series.|$|E

After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E

500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>before.</b> [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

Hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to Smith, but could do little more before leaving Rhodesia that evening. On 29 July, Smith fielded questions from the press, commenting on both Lisbon and the independence talks in general. He expressed the belief that Rhodesia had made more progress towards independence talking with Hughes than it <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>before,</b> but qualified this by saying only Wilson's reply to the proposals given to Hughes would show if this were indeed true. He said that although he thought Whitehall was keen to resolve the independence issue, he did not believe their line had changed. He declared that he and the RF would not change their stance in any way. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith stressed that this was separate from the independence dispute, then overruled Dupont's announcement of two days before: Reedman's appointment would remain provisional until further notice, he said.|$|E

It {{was one of the}} earliest successful attempts to explain the racial divide in America in terms of the social conditions imposed on African-Americans by the dominant white society.
