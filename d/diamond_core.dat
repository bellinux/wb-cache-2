40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the mechanical behavior of sandwich panels containing cellular cores of varying shape. Compression and four point bend tests were performed on sandwich panels with square and triangular honeycomb cores. These honeycombs were made of perforated aluminum sheet of repeating diamond and hexagonal patterns. The sandwich panel assemblies were joined via dip brazing. Defects were introduced into some panels to quantify the effect on strength and stiffness. Hybrid sandwich panels, consisting of foam material in the void spaces of the square and triangular cells were evaluated for {{the effect on the}} defect tolerance of the structures. The results showed that sandwich panels with <b>diamond</b> shaped <b>cores</b> had compressive strengths approximately four times greater than hexagonal shaped cores. In four point bending the <b>diamond</b> <b>cores</b> were approximately twice as stiff as cores made from hexagonal patterned sheet. The introduction of defects lowered strength by about 30 % for <b>diamond</b> <b>cores</b> in compression, and about 15 % for hexagonal cores. In four point bending this strength reduction was not as significant due to shear stresses damaging periodicity at a faster rate than in compression. (cont.) The use of foam within the cells resulted in higher absolute peak compression and flexure loads, however the Load/Density ratios demonstrated cases where the added weight of the foam did not result in a better panel. A difference of nearly an order of magnitude between the highest and lowest compressive and flexure loads is evident when the presence of defects and foam are taken into account. by Brian P. Hohmann.

The drilling mechanism is a pneumatic reciprocating piston known as a [...] "hammer" [...] driving a tungsten-steel drill bit. RC drilling utilises much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 metres are routinely achieved. RC drilling ideally produces dry rock chips, as large air compressors dry the rock out ahead of the advancing drill bit.

5000|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>core</b> {{drilling}} (exploration diamond drilling) utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated {{drill bit}} {{attached to the}} end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to make <b>diamond</b> <b>core</b> bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations [...] The diamonds are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions — lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.|$|E
