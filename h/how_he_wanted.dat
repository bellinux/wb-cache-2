5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} {{starting}} this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to film it and they agreed {{that it might be}} the only chance they were ever {{going to have to make}} a black-and-white film.|$|E
25|$|Michael Slovis was the cinematographer of Breaking Bad {{beginning}} with the second season and he received critical acclaim for his work throughout the series. Critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the TV series. Although series creator Vince Gilligan and Slovis wanted to shoot Breaking Bad in cinemascope, Sony and AMC did not grant them permission. Gilligan cited Sergio Leone's Westerns as a reference for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the series to look. For his work, he received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series and Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series.|$|E

In a fit of madness, the man runs away and dies soon after, falling from a cliff. After giving him a hasty burial, Teru resumes his journey.|$|R

25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, that he did {{not think}} he was a good actor, but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|Umar {{wanted a}} decisive victory {{early in the}} {{campaign}} to boost the morale of his troops, while demoralizing the Persians. Before Umar could issue orders of reappointment, Khalid, residing in Emesa, died. In various campaigns in Persia, Umar even appointed the commanders of the wings, {{the center and the}} cavalry of the army. Umar strictly instructed his commanders to consult him before making any decisive move in Persia. All the commanders, before starting their assigned campaigns, were instructed to send a detailed report of the geography and terrain of the region and the position of the Persian garrisons, forts, cities and troops in it. Umar then would send them a detailed plan of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> this region to be captured. Only the tactical issues were left to the field commanders to be tackled in accordance with the situation they faced at their fronts. Umar appointed the best available and well reputed commanders for the campaign.|$|E
25|$|In June 1819, modern {{founder of}} Singapore, Thomas Stamford Raffles {{instructed}} the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, to reserve the whole space within the Old Lines and the Singapore River (i.e. the northern bank) for public purposes. However, Farquhar found it expedient to allow European merchants to encroach the reserved space as this {{appeared to be}} the only suitable site for mercantile firms and godowns, since the southern bank was then too swampy. Farquhar also built a temporary home with an attap roof and kajang walls on the current Singapore Cricket Club site, on the edge which {{came to be known as}} Raffles Plain. When Raffles returned to the island in October 1822, Raffles disapproved of the encroaching by mercantile interests of land he had set aside for public use. Raffles immediately countermanded Farquhar's permits, put a stay on all buildings in the area and appointed a committee with strict and explicit instructions on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the town of Singapore to be planned. As the Esplanade plan had been broken, it was necessary to designate a new site for the town's public buildings. The area chosen was the Padang Besar or simply the Padang, as it is known today.|$|E

25|$|Puccini left {{instructions}} that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano {{was chosen to}} flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's Nerone after the composer’s death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini's publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera La leggenda di Sakùntala resembled Turandot in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, {{and even a few}} sentences added to the libretto which was not considered complete even by Puccini himself. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, he was forced to write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini's sketches more closely, {{to the point where he}} did not set some of Adami's text to music because Puccini had not indicated <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it to sound. Ricordi's real concern was not the quality of Alfano's work, but that he wanted the end of Turandot to sound as if it had been written by Puccini, and Alfano's editing had to be seamless. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed.|$|E
500|$|When Timberlake {{began working}} on FutureSex/LoveSounds at Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia, {{they had no idea}} of what the album would be like with no plan for it or even a title. He told his {{collaborators}} to do a remake of his previous single, [...] "Cry Me a River". Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: [...] "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' and not in the sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the song to sound, because there was no direction for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> [...] to sound." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{author and}} {{journalist}} Richie Unterberger described Axis as the least impressive Experience album, according to author Peter Doggett, the release [...] "heralded a new subtlety in Hendrix's work". Mitchell commented: [...] "Axis {{was the first}} time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board, as well as playing, and had some positive ideas of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> things recorded. It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{directing}} The Last of the Mohicans, Mann {{decided to}} remake L.A. Takedown {{into a wide}} release cinema feature. He viewed the film as a dry run for the original story, which was a complex, multi-layered crime drama axed for the television film. He consulted a longer 1986 draft {{to work on the}} remake. Having made L.A. Takedown, Mann felt he had a much better idea of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to structure the remake, saying: [...] "I charted the film out like a 2 hr 45 min piece of music, so I'd know where to be smooth, where not to be smooth, where to be staccato, where to use a pulse like a heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Gimmick! was {{conceived}} by lead designer Tomomi Sakai, who put {{a variety of}} ideas into the programming of the game. The game may have been developed with a MicroVAX minicomputer, but Sakai claims he could have made the game <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> regardless of what equipment was used. In order to rival {{with the quality of}} Super NES games, a large staff was required. He had always thought about developing his own game with Yoshiaki Iwata and Hiroyuki Kagoya, who were involved in designing Blaster Master, a previous Sunsoft title. The two, however, were paid very little for their involvement in making Gimmick!. Sound programmer Naohisa Morota, who had left Sunsoft shortly before development of Gimmick!, would work for Sakai as an [...] "outsourcer".|$|E

500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} instructions on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single {{should have a}} paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified.

500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch out <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E
500|$|In November 2002, Justin Timberlake {{released}} his debut album, Justified, and produced the U.S. top-five singles [...] "Rock Your Body" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] {{in particular was}} credited for having helped the album sell and peak on the music charts. Justified ended selling four million copies in the United States alone. Although the album established Timberlake's career outside his then-band *NSYNC, Timberlake (who was 22 {{years old at the}} time), was [...] "at a crossroads" [...] and felt he was at the stage of being [...] "burnt out", and thought he had lost his voice [...] "in regards to knowing what (and <b>how)</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to sing". Timberlake stated that Justified had been years in the making, and a record that would re-create its success would be a challenge he was not ready to take.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel and written by Dan Greaney, who wanted to explore what Bart's life would end up like. Several designs {{were made by the}} animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> him to look. Reception of [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] by critics has been generally mixed to negative. In 2003, it was named the worst episode of the series by Entertainment Weekly writers who felt the [...] "looking-into-the-future premise" [...] was carried out better in [...] "Lisa's Wedding." [...] Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD {{along with the rest of}} the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, because of a reference to the presidency of Donald Trump.|$|E
500|$|Some of the New York {{recordings}} were uptempo {{and contain}} {{in the fifth}} verse the additional line [...] "He examines the nightingale's code". Historian Sean Wilentz, for his book Dylan In America, listened closely to full studio tapes of the Blonde on Blonde sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] played. At one point, Dylan says: [...] "It's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan [...] "quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde—and it is still not right." [...] Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on [...] in 2005.|$|E
500|$|His {{legacy is}} that of {{changing}} the mindset of a league {{that for a long}} time had had the St. Louis Cardinals as its southernmost and westernmost team (American League Kansas City Athletics had moved west 3 years earlier from Philadelphia).

[...] When asked <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be remembered, O'Malley said, [...] "for planting a tree." [...] The tree provided the branches to open up the West Coast to baseball, but O'Malley's son remembers his father's 28years on Major League Baseball's executive council as service that [...] "was instrumental in the early stages of the game's international growth."
