40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} the fair {{allocation}} of indivisible goods and its generalization to matroids. The notions of fairness un-der consideration are equitability, proportionality and envy-freeness. It is long known that some instances fail to admit a fair allocation. However, an almost fair solution may exist if an appropriate relax-ation of the fairness condition is adopted. This article deals with a matroid problem which comprises the allocation of indivisible goods as a special case. It {{is to find a}} base of a matroid and to allocate it to a pool of agents. We first adapt the aforementioned <b>fairness</b> con-cepts <b>to</b> matroids. Next we propose a relaxed notion of <b>fairness</b> said <b>to</b> be near <b>to</b> <b>fairness.</b> Near fairness respects the <b>fairness</b> up <b>to</b> one element. We show that a nearly fair solution always exists and it can be constructed in polynomial time in the general context of matroids. ...|$|R

In the election of June 1992, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party won handily in the Czech lands {{on a platform of}} economic reform. Vladimír Mečiar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia emerged as the leading party in Slovakia, basing its appeal on <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Slovak demands for autonomy. Federalists, like Havel, were unable to contain the trend toward the split. In July 1992, President Havel resigned. In the latter half of 1992, Klaus and Mečiar hammered out an agreement that the two republics would go their separate ways {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Stouten (2006) further {{generalized}} {{the principle}} of <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> {{be applied to the}} provision of public goods. He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the free rider problem and an under-provision of public goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} sport on campus was rowing, but it {{initially}} had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed {{early in the}} campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball.

After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college leave out of <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E

The AAFC did not start play until after the war, however, and Brown continued {{to get ready for}} the 1945 season at Great Lakes. That year, many of his best players were transferred to bases on the West Coast as the focus of the war shifted to the Pacific. The team started with a 0–4–1 record, but rattled off six straight wins after the war ended and players returned from service overseas. Within weeks of Brown's final Bluejackets game, a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame, he set off for his new job in Cleveland.|$|E

500|$|McBride {{first set}} his sights on Notre Dame's Frank Leahy as his team's head coach, and the two men shook hands on a deal to make him coach and general manager. Not wanting to lose Leahy, however, Notre Dame's {{president}} objected and McBride backed off. He then asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich who he should hire. Dietrich suggested Paul Brown, the Ohio State Buckeyes coach who was then serving in the U.S. Navy and coaching a team at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago. With his limited football knowledge, McBride had never heard of Brown, and it was Ward who made the initial approach. McBride later met with Brown, whose star was on the rise after bringing Ohio State its first national championship in 1942, and offered him $17,500 a year ($ in current dollar terms) – the biggest salary for any football coach at any level – and an ownership stake in the team.
