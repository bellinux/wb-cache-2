500|$|The {{character}} is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life." [...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] {{can deal with the}} concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E
500|$|Much of the plot, {{including}} Ruth's blue convertible and Homer and Wiggum's {{fall over}} the chasm, is {{a parody of}} the Ridley Scott film Thelma & Louise. Crystal Buzz Cola is {{a reference to the}} fad drink Crystal Pepsi, and when Homer reaches into the vending machine, a can of Fresca is seen in a skeletal hand. The comedian who performs at the telethon who the Simpson family does not find funny is a parody of Garrison Keillor. Ruth mistakenly inserts Lesley Gore's song [...] "Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows" [...] into her car stereo before beginning her and Marge's wild night out; later, Chief Wiggum plays the song on his police cruiser's stereo as [...] "appropriate" [...] car chase music. After extracting the wrong tape, Ruth pops in [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] by Guns N' Roses. The scene when Homer is in Moe's Tavern is emulated from Thelma & Louise. Quimby dancing in a night club is in reference to the Kennedys. When Marge gets hit on in the bar, the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not talk is a caricature of show runner David Mirkin. The old man that comes out when Marge is shooting his cans is a parody of Walter Brennan. The episode's closing sequence is a reference to Dragnet. George Fenneman recorded the ending in the same fashion as he did on Dragnet.|$|E
2500|$|At the 83rd minute, {{with the}} score at 1–1, referee Roberto Rosetti called a foul against Spain's Carles Puyol. France's Thierry Henry went down holding his face, {{although}} Puyol appeared {{to hit him}} in the chest. Patrick Vieira scored from the resulting free kick and France won the match 3–1. [...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong." [...] Spain coach Luis Aragonés also called the foul [...] "non-existent". But Henry said, [...] "Puyol came up to me afterwards and apologised so how is that cheating?" [...] He also told reporters, [...] "Look at the replay, their left-back was going to take the ball and Puyol came across me and blocked me. If that's basketball that's a good block, but we're not playing basketball. In my head I'm not a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> go down or cheats." [...] Television announcer and former Netherlands international Ruud Gullit said of the play, [...] "I am a little bit disappointed. It shows that cheating works." ...|$|E

5000|$|The state {{determined}} that it would only guarantee policy values up {{to a total of}} $100,000, based not on who the buyer was, but on the insured.
