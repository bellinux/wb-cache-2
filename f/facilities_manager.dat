Among the women identified in receipts that Scotti preserved for more than 20 years were Shawn Thompson, Cosby's admitted mistress who later accused him of fathering her child, and Angela Leslie, who claimed Cosby made unwanted sexual advances toward her in the early 1990s. Scotti [...] "suspected that [...] was having sex with them". He also noted that Cosby [...] "was covering himself by having my name on [...] It was a coverup". Scotti also claimed that Cosby regularly took aspiring models and actresses into his dressing room and instructed Scotti, [...] "Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in." [...] In a later interview for NBCs Today Show, Scotti said he [...] "felt like a pimp". Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer denied Scotti's accusations and said the walker-bound 90-year-old was merely seeking [...] "his 15 minutes of fame".|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the role of <b>facility</b> <b>managers</b> in project design. <b>Facility</b> <b>managers</b> {{play a crucial role in}} ensuring the continuous sustainable performance of facilities. They are responsible for the planning and management of facility operations and maintenance to ensure that these are done in a cost-effective manner. Despite the crucial role that they play, the facility design process tends to leave out <b>facility</b> <b>managers.</b> This results in designs that are not easy to operate and maintain. In order to improve facility maintainability there is a need for input from <b>facility</b> <b>managers</b> at the project design stage; involving <b>facility</b> <b>managers</b> in project design should result in designs and material choices that make facilities easy and cost-effective to operate and maintain. The research relied on secondary sources, which included books, journals and online resources. These secondary data sources were used in the literature review to identify the functions of facility management, and these functions were linked to the design process. Questionnaires were then used to get primary data from selected respondents (purposive sampling was used in {{this research}}). The analysis of collected data revealed that design considerations and building material choices made at the project design stage have a bearing on the ease and cost-effectiveness of facility operation and maintenance. Therefore, decisions made at the project design stage must take into account facility management functions to ensure that operation and maintenance of facilities are cost-effective. The main conclusion from the research is that <b>facility</b> <b>manager</b> involvement in project design should lead to better designs in terms of facility operation and maintenance, particularly for large complex facilities. The choice of procurement methods and design processes also has a bearing on project design, and choices made in this regard must allow for all stakeholders in the project design stage (including <b>facility</b> <b>managers)</b> to provide input in project design...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{changing}} nature of the facilities management (FM) profession, <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> are increasingly engaged with the evolving sustainability agenda in the UK and the development or uptake of sustainability policies within their organisations. This study investigates how <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> are engaging with the sustainability agenda and the drivers, policy issues and information they use to improve their sustainability performance management. A web based self-administered questionnaire survey of <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> in the UK was conducted to identify drivers and issues that influence and support good sustainable practices. A total of 268 <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> responded. The results indicate that legislation is the most important driver for the implementation of sustainable practices. Corporate image and Organisational ethos are also recognised. However demand for efficient monitoring, management and reporting on environmental impact is not highly rated even though the top three issues of sustainability managed by <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> are energy management, waste and recycling management and carbon footprint. In addition, <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> are expected to take ownership of activities assigned to the reduction of carbon emission. Government industries and organisation with high turnover {{are more likely to have}} a sustainability policy. Financial constraints are the main barriers while legislations are the main driver for implementing sustainability. For non-profit organisations and the charitable sector, financial constraints are no hindrance to implementing a sustainability policy. The conclusion drawn is that sustainability agendas continue to be influenced by regulated environmental issues rather than a balanced approach which takes into consideration the wider social and economic aspects of sustainability. While this scenario is far from ideal, the expectation is that the organisation will trust FM to take a vital role in delivering a comprehensive sustainability policy due to the rising tide of legislation, public scrutiny, as well as the needed business case for genuinely embracing sustainability. However, as the integration of sustainability with core business strategies is continuously evolving the emphasis on different drivers will vary from organisation to organisation as well as the responsibilities of <b>facilities</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R

Almost all <b>facility</b> <b>managers</b> report concerns about these issues, and the responses do not vary much across local governments with different characteristics. There is also widespread concern, albeit less serious, about organizational structure and recuitment problems. Local governments with a decentralized facility management {{are more concerned about}} the organizational structure than those with a centralized structure, and low-population local governments are more concerned about recruitment problems than those with a high population.

40|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{the world}} was shaken by the deepest {{recession}} since the Great Depression. This event has forced changes on many industries and professions - including Facility Management. This paper provides a "snapshot view" of how <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> and <b>Facility</b> Management departments are navigating the financial meltdown. Preliminary research focused on previous recessionary periods, and the impact that they had {{on the development of}} Facility Management. In the recessions of the eighties, nineties and two thousands, <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> started professional associations and developed professional certifications for themselves. At the same time, more businesses began utilizing the Facility Management function in order to orchestrate an increasingly complicated (and potentially expensive) built environment. At the same time, the same economic pressures led both to an increase in the use of outsourcing, and a backlog of deferred maintenance. <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> had to be both innovative and flexible to survive in the industry - which has seen little growth in the 2000 s. The main focus of this paper was a survey answered by 119 <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers.</b> In it, they reported on both how their departments were responding to the recession, and also how they were personally managing their careers during this time. Follow-up questions were also asked of some <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers,</b> to get a more detailed understanding of their answers. The main strategy that the survey found Facility Management departments turning to during the current recession was deferred maintenance, followed by staffing cuts and contract renegotiations. <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> also reported that they are continuing to shift work to outsourcers - although some FMs reported that they have either outsourced all the work they can, or {{that there is no way}} to outsource some of the tasks that they do. In those cases, they focused on doing more work in-house. Individual <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> tended to have relatively long careers, with about seventy percent being in their positions for longer than three years. Also, of those FMs who reported being unemployed, the majority had only been out of work for less than six months. Many of the <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> questioned in this survey stated that they believed networking was a key component of their jobs. There were some who disagreed with this, however, believing that technical knowledge has become much more important than a strong social network. About equal numbers of people who had been in their jobs for about a year reported finding those jobs through job-boards as through networking Most of the <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> who responded to the survey are not aware of any initiatives devoted specifically to helping out-of-work FMs. These groups do exist, however, and some were discovered in the course of researching this paper. It's notable that many <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> appeared to have much more negative view of social networking sites than they do of in-person networking. The paper concludes by speculating on what the various results mean. While Facility Management departments appear to be laying professionals off, the long tenures and short periods of unemployment may signal that <b>Facility</b> <b>managers</b> are still in demand - even in times of recession. They may actually be more in demand now than in normal times, because of the need to balance multiple needs during a time of constrained spending on both capital and operating budgets. One red flag on the horizon is the perception of new technologies by respondents to this survey. <b>Facility</b> <b>Managers</b> were originally hired to manage costly new technologies in the workplace - this is something that they must continue to do in the future, and if they are not comfortable with changes that are coming, the profession may be bypassed or become marginalized. This may be a generational issue, which will be solved as younger people enter the industry. M. S.

40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an {{approach}} to improving {{the efficiency of the}} building process and potentially providing the key data set needed by <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> to operate buildings in a more sustainable manner. Whilst the design/construction phase of BIM is well advanced, the facilities management phase is not. Although attempts to develop similar facilities management models have been tried before, they have failed because of the complexity of data analysis and the inadequacies of the available computing technologies. However, the BIM concept could overcome these problems and provide the basis for a new information model for sustainable building operation and management. This paper will present the initial stages of a three-year project to develop a BIM solution to support the sustainable facilities management of a multiuse commercial building. The paper summarises the theoretical application of BIM to facilities management and presents the results of a small questionnaire survey and stakeholder workshop to ascertain <b>facilities</b> <b>managers</b> understanding of, an attitudes towards, BIM.
