40|$|The {{performance}} {{and efficiency of}} AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes have been limited by the extremely low light-extraction efficiency (LEE) due to the intrinsic material properties of AlGaN. Here, to enhance the LEE of the device, we demonstrate an AlGaN nanowires light-emitting diode (NWs-LED) integrated with nitride/air Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) nanogratings. Compared to a control device (only mesa), the AlGaN NWs-LED with the nitride/air DBR nanogratings exhibit enhancement in the light output power and external quantum efficiency (EQE) {{by a factor of}} ∼ 1. 67. The higher light output power and EQE are attributed mainly to the multiple reflectances laterally for the transverse magnetic (TM) -polarized light and scattering introduced by the nanogratings. To further understand the LEE enhancement, the electrical field distribution, extraction ratio and polar pattern of the AlGaN NWs-LED with and without the nitride/air DBR nanogratings were analyzed using the finite-difference-time-domain method. It was observed that the TM-field emission was confined and scattered upward whereas the polar pattern was intensified for the AlGaN NWs-LED with the nanogratings. Our approach to enhance the LEE via the nitride/air DBR nanogratings can provide a promising route for increasing the efficiency of AlGaN-based LEDs, also, to functioning as <b>facet</b> <b>mirror</b> for AlGaN-based laser diodes...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{measuring}} system is proposed which can measure the 3 -dimensional position and orientation of rigid bodies. Its measurement principle {{is based on}} detection of laser beam reflected from a specially fabricated mirror {{that looks like a}} triangular pyramid having an equilateral cross-sectional shape. The mirror has three lateral reflective surfaces inclined 45 ° to its bottom surface. We call this mirror 3 -facet mirror. The 3 -facet mirror is mounted on the object whose position and orientation are to be measured. The measurement is operated by a laser-based optical system composed of a 3 <b>facet</b> <b>mirror,</b> a He-Ne laser source, three position-sensitive detectors(PSD). In the sensor system, three PSDs are located at three corner points of a triangular formation, which is an equilateral triangular formation lying parallel to the reference plane. The sensitive areas of three PSDs are oriented toward the center point of the triangular formation. The object whose position and orientation are to be measured is situated at the center with the 3 -facet mirror on its top surface. A laser beam is emitted from the He-Ne laser source located at the upright position and vertically incident {{on the top of the}} 3 -facet mirror. Since each reflective facet faces toward each PSD, the laser beam is reflected at the 3 -facet mirror and splits into three subbeams, each of which is reflected from the three facets and finally arrives at three PSDs, respectively. Since each PSD is a 2 -dimensional sensor, we can acquire the information on the 6 -degree-of-freedom motion of the 3 -facet mirror. From this principle, we can get the 3 -dimensional position and orientation of any object simply by mounting the 3 -facet mirror on th...|$|E

The results of these two experiments are compared, and it is determined that the refractive index and the single-pass gain along the horizontal axis of the waveguide are higher than those along the vertical axis.

Therefore, the relative intensity noise (RIN), which is defined as ratio of the square value of the intensity fluctuation to that of the CW power can be improved by the amplification by the SOA. On the other hand, the signal to the noise ratio (S/N ratio) defined for ratio of the square value of the modulated signal power to that of the intensity fluctuation have both cases of the degradation and the improvement by the amplification depending on combination of the modulation and the noise frequencies.
