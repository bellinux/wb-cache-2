5000|$|The {{vertical}} stabilizer often employs a small fillet or [...] "dorsal fin" [...] at its forward base which helps {{to increase the}} stall angle of the vertical surface (thanks to vortex lift) and to prevent a phenomenon called rudder lock or rudder reversal. Rudder lock occurs when the force on a deflected rudder (in a steady sideslip) suddenly reverses as the {{vertical stabilizer}} stalls.

50|$|The rear {{portion of}} the lower surface of the airfoil hinges {{downwards}} from {{the leading edge of}} the flap, while the upper surface stays immobile.

At <b>full</b> <b>deflection,</b> a split flaps acts much like a spoiler, adding significantly to drag coefficient. It also adds a little to lift coefficient. It was invented by Orville Wright and James M. H. Jacobs in 1920, but only became common in the 1930s and was then quickly superseded. The Douglas DC-1 (progenitor to the DC-3 and C-47) was one of the first of many aircraft types to use split flaps.|$|E

5000|$|VMF-213 {{was formed}} July 1, 1942 at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii. The {{squadron}} left MCAS Ewa on February 21, 1943 {{and arrived at}} Espiritu Santo on March 1, 1943. They received their first F4U Corsairs while at Espiritu on March 11, 1943 and after a brief stint training they moved to Guadalcanal in April 1943. On June 17, 1943, VMF-213 relieved VMF-124 in the Russell Islands. While in the Solomons, VMF-213 participated in actions against New Georgia and Kahali and flew throughout the Solomon Islands until December 1943. In mid-1943, VMF-213 harmonised the six [...]50 inch wing guns of their Mk I Vought F4U Corsairs to converge to a point 300 ft ahead. The squadron's usual tactic was to dive upon an enemy from the front and slightly to one side (a high-side attack using <b>full</b> <b>deflection)</b> and fire when at the convergence distance.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very close}} {{convergence}} point proved devastatingly effective for some pilots. The highest scoring fighter {{pilot in the}} world, German Major Erich Hartmann, set the wing guns (later cannon) of his Bf 109 to converge at 50 m because of his preference for waiting to attack until very near his opponent. In the Pacific War in mid-1943, American Marine Fighting Squadron 213 harmonised the six [...]50 inch wing guns of their Mk I Vought F4U Corsairs to converge to a point 300 ft ahead.

American ace Major Bill Chick of the 317th Fighter Squadron based in North Africa in January 1944 bore-sighted the guns of his Thunderbolt to converge at 300 ft {{because he did not}} care for deflection shots and instead attacked his targets from the rear at that distance.|$|E
40|$|Level-flight {{performance}} {{tests were conducted}} on a typical light general aviation single-engine retractable aircraft with partially and fully extended partial-span single-slotted flaps in both gear-up and gear-extended configurations. A parabolic variation in the aircraft equivalent parasite drag area with flap deflection was observed for both configurations. A linear relation was discovered between the aircraft equivalent parasite drag area and {{the square of the}} flap deflection angle for both configurations. This result suggests that level-flight {{performance tests}} in the stowed and fully extended flap configurations will yield adequate data for estimating performance for intermediate flap deflections. A similar linear relation was confirmed for an NACA 23012 airfoil equipped with a single-slotted flat using classical NACA wind-tunnel data. The flight tests showed that the aircraft equivalent parasite drag area increased by a factor of 1. 16 at 10, by 1. 81 at 20, and by 3. 14 at a <b>full</b> flap <b>deflection</b> of 32 in the gear-up configuration.

5000|$|If {{a single}} failure occurs below {{decision}} height AUTOLAND FAULT will be displayed, however {{at that point}} the aircraft is committed to landing and the autoland system will remain engaged, controlling the aircraft on only two systems until the pilot completes the rollout and brings the aircraft to a full stop on the runway or turns off the runway onto a taxiway. This is termed [...] "fail active." [...] However, in this state the autoland system is [...] "one fault away" [...] from disengaging so the AUTOLAND FAULT indication should inform the flight crew to monitor the system behavior very carefully and be ready to take control immediately. The system is still fail active and is still performing all necessary cross checks so that if one of the flight control computers decides that {{the right thing to do}} is order a <b>full</b> <b>deflection</b> of a control surface, the other computer will detect that there is a difference in the commands and this will take both computers off line (fail passive) at which time the flight crew must immediately take control of the aircraft as the automatic systems have done the safe thing by taking themselves off line.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent {{designs of}} {{ohmmeter}} provided a small battery {{to apply a}} voltage to a resistance via a galvanometer to measure the current through the resistance (battery, galvanometer and resistance all connected in series). The scale of the galvanometer was marked in ohms, because the fixed voltage from the battery assured that as resistance is increased, the current through the meter (and hence deflection) would decrease. Ohmmeters form circuits by themselves, therefore they cannot be used within an assembled circuit. This design is much simpler and cheaper than the former design, and was simple to integrate into a multimeter design and consequently {{was by far the}} most common form of analogue ohmmeter. This type of ohmmeter suffers from two inherent disadvantages. First, the meter needs to be zeroed by shorting the measurement points together and performing an adjustment for zero ohms indication prior to each measurement. This is because as the battery voltage decreases with age, the series resistance in the meter needs to be reduced to maintain the zero indication at <b>full</b> <b>deflection</b> (assuming it's adjustable). Second, and consequent on the first, the actual deflection for any given resistor under test changes as the internal resistance is altered. It remains correct at the centre of the scale only, which is why such ohmmeter designs always quote the accuracy [...] "at centre scale only".|$|E
5000|$|The first ohmmeters {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the <b>full</b> <b>deflection</b> range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|E

The apparatus may {{also be used to}} monitor fluorescence alone, in an open mode, in which gas is passed continuously through the chamber...|$|R
50|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages. The product of the basic full-scale deflection current of the movement, and {{the sum of the}} series resistance and the movement's own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range. As an example, a meter movement that required 1 milliampere for <b>full</b> scale <b>deflection,</b> with an internal resistance of 500 ohms, would, on a 10-volt range of the multimeter, have 9,500 ohms of series resistance.|$|R
