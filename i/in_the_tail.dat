Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations. Two stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> represented part of Shilou, the tower with the market office.

5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} white <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> feathers. They {{can also be}} {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls.

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) {{belongs to}} the honeyeaters, a group of birds found mainly in Australia and New Guinea which have highly {{developed}} brush-tipped tongues adapted for nectar feeding.

5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

50|$|For instance, {{if there}} is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have two {{possible}} worlds, the first with one observer, the second with two. These worlds are equally probable, hence the SSA probability of being the first (and only) observer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heads world is 1/2, that of being <b>the</b> first observer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> world is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of being <b>the</b> second observer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> world is also 1/4.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> {{probability}} theory, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> {{dependence of}} a pair of random variables is a measure of their comovements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of <b>the</b> distributions. The concept is used in extreme value theory. Random variables that appear to exhibit no correlation can show tail dependence in extreme deviations. For instance, it is a stylized fact of stock returns that they commonly exhibit tail dependence.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's Parent Company, {{announced}} {{that they would be}} re-branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon. For this change, a new livery has been adopted. The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific's new livery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> logo and font. The major difference is instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme, it has a light maroon theme. The titles say Cathay Dragon along with Chinese lettering reading the name. Dragonair's Dragon logo has been retained and appears next to the cockpit windows. Airbus A330-300, B-HYQ, was the first aircraft to wear the new livery.|$|E

5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being thought of as bad omens.

5|$|Irish {{zoologist}} Nicholas Aylward Vigors {{established the}} genus Platycercus in 1825, {{based on the}} distinctive architecture of the feathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, {{though there was no}} need for a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
