500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are {{broad and}} angular with narrow rear tips; {{the front of}} the pectoral fin is separate from the <b>head,</b> <b>forming</b> a triangular lobe. The two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape, and are positioned far back on the body. The anal fin is absent. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the upper. The dermal denticles have rounded bases and three horizontal ridges. There is a distinctive band of larger thorns running along the midline of the back, from the nape to the caudal peduncle. The dorsal coloration varies from greenish or bluish gray to reddish brown, with a scattering of small, darker spots and sometimes irregular splotches; the underside is uniformly pale. This species reaches [...] in length and at least [...] in weight.|$|E

Other tops include Seatallan, Haystacks and Kirk Fell. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. Wastwater, located in this part, is England's deepest lake.|$|E
2500|$|Stingarees are {{modestly}} sized, {{ranging from}} [...] long. They have greatly enlarged pectoral fins fused to the <b>head,</b> <b>forming</b> a disc {{that may be}} nearly circular, to oval, to rhomboid in shape. The snout is usually short and does not protrude much from the disc. The eyes are placed atop the disc and usually fairly large; immediately posterior are teardrop-shaped spiracles (auxiliary respiratory openings). There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils, formed from the fusion of the anterior nasal flaps, that reaches the mouth. There are varying numbers of papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor of}} the mouth and sometimes also on the outside of the lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small, with rhomboid bases and blunt to pointed crowns; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern and number less than 50 rows in either jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are short and located beneath the disc.|$|E

60|$|The {{foremost}} beam, {{crossing the}} gunwales, extended some twelve feet beyond {{the side of}} the dais; and at regular intervals hereupon, stout cords were fastened, which, leading up {{to the head of the}} mast, answered the purpose of shrouds. The breeze was now streaming fresh; and, as if to force down into the water the windward side of the craft, five men stood upon this long beam, grasping five shrouds. Yet they failed to counterbalance the pressure of the sail; and owing to the opposite inclination of the twin canoes, these living statues were elevated high above the water; their appearance rendered still more striking by their eager attitudes, and the apparent peril of their position, as the mad spray from the bow dashed over them. Suddenly, the Islanders threw their craft into the wind; while, for ourselves, we lay on our oars, fearful of alarming them by now coming nearer. But hailing them again, we said we were friends; and had friendly gifts for them, if they would peaceably permit us to approach. This understood, there ensued a mighty clamor; insomuch, that I bade Jarl and Samoa out oars, and row very gently toward the strangers. Whereupon, amid a storm of vociferations, some of them hurried to the furthest side of their dais; standing with arms arched over their heads, as if for a dive; others menacing us with clubs and spears; and one, an old man with a bamboo trellis on his <b>head</b> <b>forming</b> a sort of arbor for his hair, planted himself full before the tent, stretching behind him a wide plaited sling.|$|E
6000|$|... ยง LV. This, I repeat, {{is as much}} as may ever be granted, {{but this}} ought always to be granted, to the honor and the affection of men. The tomb which stands beside that of Can Grande, nearest it in the little field of sleep, already shows the traces of erring ambition. It is the tomb of Mastino the Second, in whose reign began the decline of his family. It is {{altogether}} exquisite {{as a work of}} art; and the evidence of a less wise or noble feeling in its design is found only in this, that the image of a virtue, Fortitude, as belonging to the dead, is placed on the extremity of the sarcophagus, opposite to the Crucifixion. But for this slight circumstance, of which the significance will only be appreciated as we examine the series of later monuments, the composition of this monument of Can Mastino would have been as perfect as its decoration is refined. It consists, like that of Can Grande, of the raised sarcophagus, bearing the recumbent statue, protected by a noble foursquare canopy, sculptured with ancient Scripture history. On one side of the sarcophagus is Christ enthroned, with Can Mastino kneeling before Him; on the other, Christ is represented in the mystical form, half-rising from the tomb, meant, I believe, to be at once typical of His passion and resurrection. The lateral panels are occupied by statues of saints. At one extremity of the sarcophagus is the Crucifixion; at the other, a noble statue of Fortitude, with a lion's skin thrown over her shoulders, its <b>head</b> <b>forming</b> a shield upon her breast, her flowing hair bound with a narrow fillet, and a three-edged sword in her gauntleted right hand, drawn back sternly behind her thigh, while, in her left, she bears high the shield of the Scalas.|$|E

30|$|Each node in {{the network}} is {{connected}} in a single-hop communication to its corresponding cluster head in the above hierarchy level using link correlation, whereas in level-k hierarchy multi-hop communication is adopted between cluster heads. The level-k cluster <b>heads</b> <b>form</b> the bottleneck zone of the sink which has heavy traffic flow. This results in faster depletion of its energy reducing the network life time. To overcome it, the heterogeneous nodes are adopted as level-k cluster head, since it have more energy compared to normal nodes. After establishing a level-k cluster hierarchy using link correlation as described in section 3.1, the level-k cluster <b>head</b> <b>forms</b> a TDMA time slot for its corresponding a level-(k- 1) cluster head, while the level-(k- 1) cluster <b>head</b> <b>forms</b> a TDMA time slot for a level-(k- 2) cluster head and it is followed for all the sub-clusters. The TDMA time slot adopted between cluster heads in subsequent levels of hierarchy helps to remove the data collision and cutback the data aggregation (DA) time.|$|R
