40|$|Original held by National Archives of Australia: M 1416. This series {{comprises}} special subject {{files of}} correspondence maintained in the Prime Minister's Office from 1942 {{to the end}} of 1944, when John Curtin was Prime Minister. In general the files relate to a major public issue or aspect of government business. The 1944 files also reflect the increasing role of F M (Frank) Forde as Acting Prime Minister in the latter period of the Curtin Government. However, there are no files covering the last six months of Curtin's term of office until his death in July 1945. Most files contain representations from community groups, local <b>government</b> authorities, <b>trade</b> <b>organisations</b> or individuals on a particular issue, e. g. wartime restrictions on alcohol, legalisation of the Communist Party, J T Lang, racing. Rather than being sent directly, these letters were often forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office by the correspondent's local member of federal parliament. Other files contain material relating to general government business, e. g. Defence Act, Russia, invitations accepted and declined, correspondence with state Premiers. Many of these items contain copies of correspondence from departmental files kept by the Prime Minister's Department...|$|R
40|$|When the Pacific Islands Forum was {{established}} in 1971, regional economic integration was high on the policy agenda. Over the four decades since, a political commitment to regional integration has waxed and waned. This paper explores past and present prospects for economic cooperation {{through the lens of}} regional trade negotiations. Into the new millennium, Pacific <b>governments</b> lobbied World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation</b> (WTO) members to recognise their trade-related challenges, and sought special treatment in trade negotiations with the EU and with Australia and New Zealand. Despite these efforts, current trade negotiations among all Forum members—to extend the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER-Plus) —look unlikely to result in unique measures intended to help Pacific states take advantage of international trade. In this context, consideration should be given to downscaling formal trade negotiations in favour of other regional trade policy initiatives...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{reactions}} of the Curtin Labor <b>Government,</b> employer <b>organisations,</b> <b>trade</b> unions, the Communist Party of Australia and other labour movement groups, to the entry of women workers into 2 ̆ 7 men 2 ̆ 7 s jobs 2 ̆ 7 on munitions production and {{other areas of the}} metal industry during the Second World War. Motivated primarily by their concern that the employment of cheap female labour threatened male jobs and wage standards, the union movement demanded that the women entering industry receive the same pay rates as the men they were replacing. Rather than institute equal pay by regulation, however, the Govemment decided on the compromise solution of establishing a special wage-fixation tribunal, the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Employment Board, and empowering it to award pay rates between 60...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{transition}} to democracy, South African public works programmes {{have been designed to}} involve community participation, and have aimed to target the poor. This article examines the targeting performance of seven programmes in Western Cape Province, and analyses the role of <b>government,</b> community-based <b>organisations,</b> <b>trade</b> unions and the private sector in explaining targeting outcomes. These programmes were not well targeted geographically in terms of highest poverty, unemployment or infrastructure needs. Within localities, jobs went to the poor and unemployed, though not always the poorest, and did well in reaching women, despite gender bias. Targeting guidelines of the state are mediated by diverse and sometimes conflicting priorities that emerge in programmes with multiple objectives, by local perceptions of need and entitlement, and by competing voices within civil society.

50|$|Aarong's export {{business}} {{started in}} 1986, {{with an initial}} order from Traidcraft, a UK-based fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisation.</b> Aarong is a recognised fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisation</b> and a provisional member of IFAT, the global network of fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisations.</b> Based on Aarong's reputation as a social business, it has successfully grown its export customer base over the last 20 years through {{the addition of a}} number of fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisations</b> in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In 2007, nearly five per cent of sales came from exports, approximately 85 per cent of which were to fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisations</b> and the remaining 15 per cent to commercial organisations.The fair <b>trade</b> <b>organisations</b> are mostly wholesalers that channel products to retail outlets such as world shops or fair trade shops. Goods sold in this form are usually marketed under the importers' brand; however, retailers tend to attach stories in the tagline or promotional materials about Aarong and the social and financial benefits it provides {{for the development of the}} underprivileged artisans. Aarong maintained a London-based franchise that accounted for approximately 11 per cent of the total export sales in 2007. Aarong franchised itself in London to cater to the needs of the large Bangladeshi community living in the region. However, the franchise was not continued after 2010 in anticipation of launching an e-commerce website. In 1991 and 1992, Aarong opened its own retail outlets in Vancouver and London. Due to poor management and inventory control both locations were closed in 1994; however, Aarong remains focused on a long term strategy to enter the mainstream Western markets..|$|R
