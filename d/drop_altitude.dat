5|$|Miller, the vice-captain of the team, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. The {{servicemen}} arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. Miller scored 46 in a drawn match. The Australians headed to Delhi, but Miller missed the tour match due to food poisoning. He then led the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay with Hassett being rested. Miller top-scored with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Miller took two wickets: Rusi Modi in the first innings and Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the second. The match ended in a high-scoring draw with Miller unbeaten on 15 as Australia were 1/31 in pursuit of 112 for victory. At this point, {{with most of the}} team suffering from dysentery, some of the Australians became disenchanted with the long train journeys across the subcontinent, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was rejected, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of the}} leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team.

When this was refused, they threatened to abandon the tour or replace Lindsay Hassett, an Australian Imperial Force member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots if their wish was not granted.

50|$|While {{aircraft}} slipping and skidding {{are often}} undesired in a usual turn that maintains altitude, slipping {{of the aircraft}} {{can be used for}} practical purposes. Intentionally putting an aircraft into a slip is used as a forward slip and a sideslip. These slips are performed by applying opposite inputs of the aileron and rudder controls. A forward slip allows a pilot to quickly <b>drop</b> <b>altitude</b> without gaining unnecessary speed, while a sideslip is one method utilized to perform a crosswind landing.|$|E

50|$|Bomber Command forms {{a special}} {{squadron}} of Lancaster bombers, 617 Squadron, {{to be commanded by}} Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and tasked {{to fly the}} mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the <b>drop</b> <b>altitude</b> to be reduced to 60 ft. With only a few weeks to go, he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} for the B77 required Full Fusing Options (FUFO) {{and the ability}} for a low altitude, transonic laydown delivery, {{as well as a}} free fall from supersonic speeds and altitudes of 60,000 feet delivery. To achieve the low-level delivery capability, the B77 employed a gas generator for roll control and a lifting parachute as the initial part of a two-stage parachute system. This combination would actually lift the bomb from a <b>drop</b> <b>altitude</b> of 100 feet to 300 feet for main parachute opening. The roll control/parachute system was tested at Mach 2.2. From a delivery altitude of 100 feet at mach 2.2, the B77 could be slowed to 40 mph allowing the delivery aircraft to be 2.3 miles past ground zero. Actual detonation time could be varied after the laydown had occurred.|$|E

50|$|Viet Minh forces under General Võ Nguyên Giáp {{surrounded}} and besieged the French, {{who were}} unaware of the Viet Minh's possession of heavy artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. The attack that formally began the battle was launched 13 March 1954. French artillery outposts fell within hours, and a dismal trickle of wounded survivors into Dien Bien Phu’s garrison hospital began. The French tried to hit back with artillery and airpower, including some 30 US C-119 Flying Boxcars which had modified to drop napalm on the Viet Minh artillery and flown mainly by American employees of Civil Air Transport, the contract airline founded by Maj. Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, {{the head of the}} World War II Flying Tigers. Dien Bien Phu could be supplied only via airdrop, and dropping and retrieving supplies became a nightmare as Viet Minh artillery shrank the effective size of the drop zone. On 27 March, French Col. Jean Louis Nicot, {{the man in charge of}} the aerial resupply effort, had to raise the <b>drop</b> <b>altitude</b> from 2,000 feet to 8,000 feet. Drop zone accuracy declined, and some supplies inevitably fell into Viet Minh hands. The French, with the encouragement of some US officials based in Saigon, pressed hard for the US to launch an overwhelming air strike to save Dien Bien Phu.|$|E

50|$|When an {{aircraft}} slows to below its stall speed, it {{is unable to}} generate enough lift in order to cancel out the forces that act on the aircraft (such as weight and centripetal force). This will cause the aircraft to <b>drop</b> in <b>altitude.</b> The <b>drop</b> in <b>altitude</b> may cause the pilot to increase the angle of attack (the pilot pulls on the stick), because normally increasing the angle of attack (pulling up) puts the aircraft in a climb. When the wing however exceeds its critical angle of attack, an increase in angle of attack (pulling up) {{will lead to a}} loss of lift and a further loss of airspeed (the wing stalls). The reason why the wing stalls when it exceeds its critical angle of attack is that the airflow {{over the top of the}} wing separates.|$|R

Although these bombs directly penetrated only around seven feet of concrete, the remaining thickness was blown in by the detonation of the bombs' enormous explosive charge. The roof of Valentin had been penetrated by two Grand Slams before the war ended but, as there was no detonation inside the bunker, there was little damage to the complex aside from the large holes in the roof; post-war examination revealed installations inside the bunker remained comparatively unscathed. The conclusion of Project Ruby was that none of the bombs tested was completely suitable, {{and the development of a}} new concrete–penetrating bomb was recommended.
