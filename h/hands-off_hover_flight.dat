In order to understand <b>hovering</b> <b>flights</b> of insects, aerodynamic lifting force and flow field around a flapping machine was measured by using time-series analysis of PIV and numerical simulation. PIV measurements were carried out with the flapping machine which was 10 times expanding model of real insects. Experimental results showed a flapping airfoil holds a strong vorticity near the bottom dead center. The leading-edge vortex and the wake-capture process were observed by the PIV measurement, which are important to understand insect’s flight. Moreover, these processes generate large amount of aerodynamic force compare to the sinusoidal flapping motion.

40|$|The inverse {{problem of}} <b>hovering</b> <b>flight,</b> that is, {{the range of}} wing {{movements}} appropriate for sustained flight at a fixed position and orientation, was examined by developing a simulation of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Inverse problems arise when one is seeking the parameters that are required to achieve a specified model outcome. In contrast, forward problems explore the outcomes given a specified set of input parameters. The simulation was coupled to a microgenetic algorithm that found specific sequences of wing and body motions, encoded by ten independent kinematic parameters, capable of generating the fixed body position and orientation characteristic of <b>hovering</b> <b>flight.</b> Additionally, we explored the consequences of restricting the number of free kinematic parameters and used this information to assess the importance to flight control of individual parameters and various combinations of them. Output from the simulated moth was compared to kinematic recordings of <b>hovering</b> <b>flight</b> in real hawkmoths; the real and simulated moths performed similarly {{with respect to their}} range of variation in position and orientation. The simulated moth also used average wingbeat kinematics (amplitude, stroke plane orientation, etc) {{similar to those of the}} real moths. However, many different subsets of the available kinematic were sufficient for <b>hovering</b> <b>flight</b> and available kinematic data from real moths does not include sufficient detail to assess which, if any, of these was consistent with the real moth. This general result, the multiplicity of possible hovering kinematics, shows that the means by which Manduca sexta actually maintains position and orientation may have considerable freedom and therefore may be influenced by many other factors beyond the physical and aerodynamic requirements of <b>hovering</b> <b>flight.</b> Supplementary material available online a...|$|R

40|$|Fixed-wing {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{with the}} ability to hover combine the speed and endurance of traditional fixed-wing fight with the stable hovering and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities of helicopters and quadrotors. This combination of abilities can provide strategic advantages for UAV operators, especially when operating in urban environments where the airspace may be crowded with obstacles. Traditionally, fixed-wing UAVs with hovering capabilities had to be custom designed for specific payloads and missions, often requiring custom autopilots and unconventional airframe configurations. With recent government spending cuts, UAV operators like the military and law enforcement agencies have been urging UAV developers to make their aircraft cheaper, more versatile, and easier to repair. This thesis discusses the use of the commercially available ArduPilot open source autopilot, to autonomously transition a fixed-wing UAV to and from <b>hover</b> <b>flight.</b> Software modifications were made to the ArduPilot firmware to add <b>hover</b> <b>flight</b> modes using both Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) Control and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) with the goal of making the controllers robust enough so that anyone in the ArduPilot community could use their own ArduPilot board and their own fixed-wing airframe (as long as it has enough power to maintain stable hover) to achieve autonomous hover after some simple gain tuning. Three new <b>hover</b> <b>flight</b> modes were developed and tested first in simulation and then in flight using an E-Flight Carbon Z Yak 54 RC aircraft model, which was equipped with an ArduPilot 2. 5 autopilot board.
