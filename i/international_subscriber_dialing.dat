5000|$|... 1976 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of <b>International</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Dialling</b> (ISD) enabling local <b>subscribers</b> to <b>dial</b> direct to over 250 million telephones in 26 countries. However, ISD was not available from coin boxes until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel radio paging system, which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|R
5000|$|DDD was {{the term}} used when the North American Numbering Plan was {{implemented}} in the 1950s. In the United Kingdom {{and other parts of}} the Commonwealth of Nations, the equivalent terms are or were [...] "STD", for <b>subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialing,</b> and [...] "ISD" [...] for <b>international</b> <b>subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the Strowger step-by-step system as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group Switching Centres which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of International Direct Dialling (IDD), initially referred to as <b>International</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Dialling</b> (ISD) within the UK, Group Switching Centres were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|R

50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as <b>subscriber</b> toll <b>dialling)</b> is a {{telephone}} system allowing <b>subscribers</b> to <b>dial</b> trunk calls without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be dialled directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be dialled.|$|R
50|$|Until 1999, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda {{shared a}} {{telephone}} numbering plan, in which subscribers were only required to dial the trunk code, area code and number. In that year, Tanzania adopted a new numbering plan. Calls to Kenya and Uganda require a regional prefix {{rather than having}} to use full international dialling. To call Kenya from Tanzania, <b>subscribers</b> <b>dial</b> 005 instead of +254, while to call Uganda, they dial 006 rather instead of +256. To call Tanzania from Kenya and Uganda, <b>subscribers</b> <b>dial</b> 007 instead of +255.|$|R
5000|$|Landlines: Written as AAA-BBBBBBB, where AAA is the <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialing</b> code (long {{distance}} code) and BBBBBBB is {{the phone}} number. The total {{length of the}} <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialing</b> code and the phone number is 10 digits.|$|R
50|$|The dialing codes used by trunk {{operators}} to connect calls were originally assigned and established to ensure speed with pulse dialing equipment. With {{the advent of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialed</b> calls, numbering patterns were reassigned to provide for mnemonic methods of improving customer performance. <b>Subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD) codes all began with 0. The largest cities, which had seven digit local numbers, were allocated special codes - London, 01; Birmingham, 021; etc. Smaller towns were typically allocated a code based on the first letters of their name, translated into digits on the telephone dial. For example, OXford translated into 09 on the British phone dial, so the original STD code for Oxford was 0096. However, because of <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialing</b> errors, there was an early decision to eliminate codes that began with 00 and Oxford soon became 0865, the sequence 86 designating the first two letter of university.|$|R
5000|$|To call Kenya from Tanzania and Uganda, <b>subscribers</b> must <b>dial</b> 005, {{followed}} by the area code and number. To call Uganda from Kenya, <b>subscribers</b> must <b>dial</b> 006, {{followed by}} the area code and number, while calls to Tanzania require the prefix 007.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a linefinder connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the <b>subscriber</b> a <b>dial</b> tone to show that it was ready to receive <b>dialed</b> digits. The <b>subscriber's</b> <b>dial</b> pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{subsequently}} augmented and superseded by a Transit Switching Centre (TSC) {{equipped with a}} crossbar switching system (TXK4) which formed part of the Transit Network. It parented two {{of the first three}} GSCs at Worcester and Wolverhampton [...] to go-live when the transit network was inaugurated in 1971 which eventually provided universal UK automatic <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialling</b> and was completed in 1979.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between trunk and toll became irrelevant when <b>subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD) was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1999, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda {{shared a}} {{telephone}} numbering plan, in which subscribers were only required to dial the trunk code, area code and number. In that year, this was discontinued following Tanzania's {{adoption of a}} new numbering plan, although calls between the three countries only required regional prefixes rather than international dialling. To call Uganda from Tanzania and Kenya, <b>subscribers</b> <b>dial</b> 006 instead of +256.|$|R
25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed <b>subscribers</b> to <b>dial</b> their own long-distance calls.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialled</b> the {{required}} number and as each digit was received it was stored in electronic circuits within the register, which will {{call for the}} MCU after each digit and ask for instructions. Until sufficient digits have been received to determine the outgoing route from the exchange, the instruction will be [...] "apply again after the next digit" [...] and the MCU returned to serving other demands.|$|R

50|$|The {{phone service}} {{began with a}} manual {{exchange}} in the Post Office. A <b>subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialling</b> system came circa 1981.|$|R
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>dialed</b> digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all step-by-step and crossbar switches in the Bell System.|$|R
50|$|Telephone administrations {{in other}} {{countries}} implemented similar programs, {{such as in the}} United Kingdom, which led to <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialling</b> (STD).|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialling,</b> most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly dialled. Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> Trunk <b>Dialling</b> albeit on a reducing basis as direct dialled routings became increasingly available until universal direct <b>dialling</b> between U.K <b>subscribers</b> became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|R
50|$|Phone {{numbers in}} Lesotho are eight digits long, {{the first two}} digits being the area code. Previously, Lesotho had area codes, which were {{integrated}} into the South African telephone numbering plan, and calls could be made from South Africa using the regional code 050. For example, to call a number in Maseru, <b>subscribers</b> would <b>dial</b> 0501, while to call a number in Mazenod, they would dial 05022. From {{the rest of the}} world, <b>subscribers</b> would <b>dial</b> +266 1.|$|R
5000|$|Montreal's local {{calls were}} {{originally}} handled manually by operators; a called party was requested by name {{before the first}} (four-digit) local numbers were assigned in July 1881. In 1898, exchange names ("Main", [...] "Westmount", [...] "Uptown" [...] or [...] "East") were added before the number. The initial rotary dial exchange, [...] "Lancaster", was deployed April 25, 1925. <b>Subscribers</b> <b>dialled</b> two letters of an exchange name and four digits (2L+4N), so [...] "Lancaster 1234" [...] became LA-1234 (or 52-1234).|$|R
