5000|$|... <b>dry</b> <b>offset</b> {{printing}}, {{a printing}} process {{which uses a}} metal backed photopolymer relief plate, similar to a letterpress plate, but, unlike letterpress printing where the ink is transferred directly from the plate to the substrate, in <b>dry</b> <b>offset</b> printing the ink is transferred to a rubber blanket before being transferred to the substrate. This method is used for printing on injection moulded rigid plastic buckets, tubs, cups and flowerpots.|$|E
40|$|Printing; is {{the process}} of {{reproduction}} rapid transfering of the images, inscriptions, figures and graphics on to a surface in the original format. The dampened system offset printing is the smooth printing system. Smooth printing is based on the principal of repelling of the water by the oil inside the ink and not to be mixed with. The printed and unprinted surfaces on the plate has a chemical characteristic. The process of printing occurs in the way that. The unprinted areas captures water and repell ink, the printed areas captures ink and repell water. The <b>dry</b> <b>offset</b> system is; the combination of the flexo and dampened system offset methods. In the method the relief part of the plate transfers the image to the smooth surfaced rubber printing cylinder and the image is transferred to the material by the cylinder. Water is not needed for humidification. So the plate is not wetted before printing. The pictures or positive dias are not printed by dry ofset method but, the hand dravings, very detailed desings and quite small texts could be printed to the range of six colors. In this study, an evaluation of the comparison of the process stages and reproduction results of the two techniques is conducted...|$|E
5000|$|Advantage: The {{areas where}} less ink is used are regions of high ink use, so the {{potential}} for <b>drying</b> and <b>offset</b> problems is reduced.|$|R
50|$|The loss of glaciers {{not only}} {{directly}} causes landslides, flash floods and glacial lake overflow, but also increases annual variation in water flows in rivers. Glacier runoff {{declines in the}} summer as glaciers decrease in size, this decline is already observable in several regions. Glaciers retain water on mountains in high precipitation years, since the snow cover accumulating on glaciers protects the ice from melting. In warmer and <b>drier</b> years, glaciers <b>offset</b> the lower precipitation amounts with a higher meltwater input.|$|R
50|$|Sempervivum arachnoideum, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} cobweb house-leek, is {{a species of}} flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to the Alps, Apennines and Carpathians. Growing to 8 cm tall by 30 cm wide, it is a rosette-forming succulent perennial, valued in cultivation {{for its ability to}} colonise hot, <b>dry</b> areas via <b>offsets.</b> Its name arachnoideum refers to its furry central rosettes, resembling spider webs. It flowers in July, with pink flowers that are raised on stems and are hermaphrodite (having both male and female organs).|$|R
5000|$|The pairing {{worked so}} well that on October 29, 1956, the two took over NBC's {{flagship}} nightly newscast, with Huntley in New York City and Brinkley in Washington, D.C., for the newly christened Huntley-Brinkley Report. Brinkley's <b>dry</b> wit <b>offset</b> the serious tone set by Huntley, and the program proved popular with audiences {{turned off by the}} incessantly serious tone of CBS's news broadcasts of that era. Brinkley's ability to write for the ear with simple, declarative sentences gained him {{a reputation as one of}} the medium's most talented writers, and his connections in Washington led CBS's Roger Mudd to observe, [...] "Brinkley, of all the TV guys here, probably has the best sense of the city--best understands its moods and mentality. He knows Washington and he knows the people." [...] Most often described as [...] "wry," [...] Brinkley once suggested on the air that the best way to resolve the controversy over whether to change the name of Boulder Dam to [...] "Hoover Dam" [...] was to have former president Herbert Hoover change his name to [...] "Herbert Boulder".|$|R
40|$|Biosolids {{produced}} by {{wastewater treatment plants}} are often stored in stockpiles and can be {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gases (GHG). Growing trees in shallow stockpiled biosolids may remove nutrients, keep the biosolids <b>drier</b> and <b>offset</b> GHG emissions through C sequestration. We directly measured methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) flux from a large biosolid stockpile and two shallow stockpiles, one planted with Salix reichardtii (willow) trees, from December 2009 to January 2011. All stockpiles emitted large annual amounts of GHG ranging from 38 kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1) dry biosolid for the large stockpile, to 65 kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1) for the unplanted shallow stockpile, probably due to the greater surface area to volume ratio. GHG emissions were dominated by N 2 O and CO 2 whilst CH 4 emissions were negligible (< 2 %) from the large stockpile and the shallow stockpiles were actually a CH 4 sink. Annual willow tree growth was 12 Mg dry biomass ha(- 1), but this only offset 8 % of the GHG emissions from the shallow planted stockpile. Our data highlight that biosolid stockpiles are significant sources for GHG emissions but alternate management options such as shallow stockpiles or planting for biomass production will not lead to GHG emission reductions.

40|$|Leaf {{attributes}} of four savanna tree species were measured along a rainfall gradient (1650 - 950 mm per annum) in the Australian monsoon tropics. As the mean annual rainfall decreased, leaf thickness increased {{for three of}} these four species. However, a corresponding decrease in leaf density for two species meant that leaf mass per area increased significantly only for one species. Physiological measurements were made during both the wet and dry seasons on comparable stands of vegetation near the extremes and middle of this gradient. Assimilation per unit mass was similar at all three sites but assimilation per leaf area was higher at the drier sites because leaves were thicker with higher mass per area. These results probably reflect reduced tree density and leaf area index at the <b>drier</b> sites, which <b>offsets</b> the lower rainfall, potentially allowing similar rates of assimilation per unit carbohydrate invested in leaves...|$|R
40|$|The {{factors that}} control the {{influence}} of deep convective detrainment on water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere are examined using observations from multiple satellites {{in conjunction with a}} trajectory model. Deep convection is confirmed to act primarily as a moisture source to the upper troposphere, modulated by the ambient relative humidity (RH). Convective detrainment provides strong moistening at low RH and <b>offsets</b> <b>drying</b> due to subsidence across a wide range of RH. Strong day-to-day moistening and drying takes place most frequently in relatively dry transition zones where the frequency of deep convective events is neither very high nor very low. Many of these strong moistening events can be directly attributed to detrainment from recent tropical convection. The temporal and spatial limits of the convective source are estimated to be about 36 – 48 h and 600 – 1500 km, respectively, consistent with the lifetimes of detrainment cirrus clouds. Larger amounts of detrained ice and smaller ice particle sizes are both associated with enhanced upper tropospheric moistening...|$|R
5000|$|Web-fed {{refers to}} the use of rolls (or [...] "webs") of paper {{supplied}} to the printing press. Offset web printing is generally used for runs in excess of five or ten thousand impressions. Typical examples of web printing include newspapers, newspaper inserts or ads, magazines, direct mail, catalogs, and books. Web-fed presses are divided into two general classes: coldset (or non-heatset) and heatset offset web presses, the difference being how the inks <b>dry.</b> Cold web <b>offset</b> printing <b>dries</b> through absorption into the paper, while heatset utilizes drying lamps or heaters to cure or [...] "set" [...] the inks. Heatset presses can print on both coated (slick) and uncoated papers, while coldset presses are restricted to uncoated paper stock, such as newsprint. Some coldset web presses can be fitted with heat dryers, or ultraviolet lamps (for use with UV-curing inks), thus enabling a newspaper press to print color pages heatset and black & white pages coldset.|$|R
40|$|Raised bogs have {{accumulated}} more atmospheric carbon {{than any other}} terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i. e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of <b>drying</b> becoming increasingly <b>offset</b> by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications fo...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{stresses}} are {{stresses that}} develop in woody plants. The release of growth stresses generates splits and distortions in both logs and lumber. Therefore, {{high levels of}} growth stress in the tree may reduce lumber quality and cause processing problems. This study investigated the effect of surface longitudinal growth strains (GS), sawing patterns and stud position in the tree on warp of yellow poplar 2 by 42 ̆ 7 s. A sample of trees was harvested during August and processed by the SDR process and the CANT sawing pattern. All the sawn pieces {{were exposed to the}} same drying conditions. After air drying, the flitches produced by the SDR process were ripped using a straight-line ripsaw to produce the 2 by 4 studs. Top logs were used to assess the idea that <b>drying</b> stresses can <b>offset</b> growth stresses resulting in straighter lumber. The level of GS increased significantly from May to September. Therefore, harvesting and processing the trees before the dormant period should result in lower levels of GS and perhaps less warping. GS averages for the butt logs were significantly lower than the second logs. Trees with large GS differences between the butt and the second log generated a higher level of green warping with minor increases following drying. After ripping, the studs from the SDR process presented lower levels of warping; however no significant differences were detected after the planing process. Studs with a flat grain pattern presented a higher level of bow and a lower level of crook than those with a quarter grain pattern. However, crook, twist and long checks in quarter sawn studs from the juvenile zone were critical for the market. By acting against each other, growth and drying stresses may help to produce straighter/split free glued pieces from the juvenile core. Log end splits generated in upper crosscuts of the tree bole were found to be good predictors of GS levels in trees and logs and of subsequent warping of the lumber produced from them. It is likely that genotypes of yellow poplar presenting low level of end splitting will reduce growth stress associated problems. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the coming}} century, {{climate change is}} {{projected}} to impact precipitation and temperature regimes worldwide, with especially large effects in drylands. We use big sagebrush ecosystems as a model dryland ecosystem to explore the impacts of altered climate on ecohydrology {{and the implications of}} those changes for big sagebrush plant communities using output from 10 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We ask: (1) What is the magnitude of variability in future temperature and precipitation regimes among GCMs and RCPs for big sagebrush ecosystems, and (2) How will altered climate and uncertainty in climate forecasts influence key aspects of big sagebrush water balance? We explored these questions across 1980 – 2010, 2030 – 2060, and 2070 – 2100 to determine how changes in water balance might develop through the 21 st century. We assessed ecohydrological variables at 898 sagebrush sites across the western US using a process-based soil water model, SOILWAT, to model all components of daily water balance using site-specific vegetation parameters and site-specific soil properties for multiple soil layers. Our modeling approach allowed for changes in vegetation based on climate. Temperature increased across all GCMs and RCPs, whereas changes in precipitation were more variable across GCMs. Winter and spring precipitation was predicted to increase in the future (7 % by 2030 – 2060, 12 % by 2070 – 2100), resulting in slight increases in soil water potential (SWP) in winter. Despite wetter winter soil conditions, SWP decreased in late spring and summer due to increased evapotranspiration (6 % by 2030 – 2060, 10 % by 2070 – 2100) and groundwater recharge (26 % and 30 % increase by 2030 – 2060 and 2070 – 2100). Thus, despite increased precipitation in the cold season, soils may dry out earlier in the year, resulting in potentially longer, drier summer conditions. If winter precipitation cannot <b>offset</b> <b>drier</b> summer conditions in the future, we expect big sagebrush regeneration and survival will be negatively impacted, potentially resulting in shifts in the relative abundance of big sagebrush plant functional groups. Our results also highlight the importance of assessing multiple GCMs to understand the range of climate change outcomes on ecohydrology, which was contingent on the GCM chosen...|$|R
