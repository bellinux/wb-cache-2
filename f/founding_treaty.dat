40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the failure of}} subsidiarity as a judicial review principle and its somewhat more successful record as a legislative review principle in the European Union. Although the <b>founding</b> <b>Treaties</b> make clear that subsidiarity is a legally binding principle, the European Court of Justice has adopted an excessively deferential approach to its judicial enforcement. The Treaty provisions have been rendered essentially meaningless platitudes so far as judicial enforcement is concerned. The European Court 2 ̆ 7 s under-en- forcement of subsidiarity should be contrasted with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s history of judicial activism. While the Court has often fashioned novel legal doctrines without express support in the <b>founding</b> <b>Treaties,</b> {{in the case of}} subsidiarity an express guarantee in the Treaties has been emptied of content by judicial interpretation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article author {{analyzes}} the institutional framework of the Customs Union of the EU and the modernized Customs Code of the EU. Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic Community. The EU Customs Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation of the customs union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field of customs cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU Customs Code occupies rules aimed at regulating the customs debt and guarantees. The provisions of the new Customs Code (Section 3 of the modernized Customs Code EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union. In conclusion, author notes that all matters relating to customs policy of the European Union are regulated in the <b>founding</b> <b>treaties</b> and the rules of the Customs Code only detail the provisions of the EU <b>founding</b> <b>treaties.</b> Author also concludes that the application of the modernized Customs Code of the European Union outside the context of the <b>founding</b> <b>treaties</b> of the European Union is impossible...|$|R

European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), European Economic Community (EEC) and European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) were the real beginning of the current European union. European Union was settled by <b>founding</b> <b>treaties</b> of above mentioned institutions. Further milestones were provisions of <b>founding</b> <b>treaties</b> and new treaties of so called primary source of the EU law, of which the final goal {{was supposed to be the}} Constitution of the European Union. This constitution was approved in a modified version excluding constitutional symbols and it is called the Lisbon Treaty.
