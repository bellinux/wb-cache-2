25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} can find it difficult to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>their</b> policy covers. and at what cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E

500|$|Following the leak, Kravitz {{discussed}} {{the song in}} a video he uploaded to the social networking site Twitter.

5000|$|Information {{access is}} {{considered}} a [...] "linchpin right" [...] on which other human rights depend, because information is essential for supporting an informed citizenry that <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>their</b> rights are and <b>what</b> <b>their</b> government is doing, or not doing, to respect those rights.

2500|$|Miletski {{believes}} that [...] "Animals {{are capable of}} sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way." [...] It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes {{that as far as}} cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and [...] "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human." [...] Animal owners normally <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>their</b> own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.|$|E

And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>their</b> intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel.
