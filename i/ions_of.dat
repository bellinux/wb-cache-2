5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process.

5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the <b>ions</b> <b>of</b> the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter <b>ions</b> <b>of</b> carbon and nitrogen.

Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer.

5|$|The weak {{magnetosphere}} around Venus {{means that}} the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, <b>ions</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, {{are more likely to}} be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.|$|E

5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing <b>ions</b> <b>of</b> sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua <b>ions</b> <b>of</b> the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E
