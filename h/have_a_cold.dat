25|$|In 2006, a debris {{field was}} {{discovered}} in orbit around this star using infrared observations by the Spitzer telescope. This debris {{is thought to be}} an asteroid belt. The measured temperature of the debris is 110K, which places it in an orbit between 4 and 6 AU from the star, or about the same distance where Jupiter orbits the Sun. This debris disk may have been created by the breakup of a single, 100km diameter planetesimal through a collision. The star system does not show any excess emission at 70 μm, indicating it does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> outer dust disk.|$|E
