40|$|For a {{space heating}} {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit, when its outdoor coil surface {{temperature}} is below both the air {{dew point temperature}} and the freezing point of water, frost will form on its outdoor coil surface. Frosting affects its operational performance and energy efficiency. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for ASHP units is reverse cycle defrost. The energy that should have been used for space heating is used to melt frost, vaporize the melted frost off outdoor coil surface and heat ambient air during defrosting. It is therefore necessary to study the sources of heat supplies and the end-uses of the heat supplied during a reverse cycle defrost operation. In this paper, firstly, an experimental setup is described and experimental procedures are detailed. This is followed by reporting the experimental results and the evaluation of <b>defrosting</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the experimental ASHP unit. Finally, an evaluation of defrosting heat supplies and energy consumptions during a revere cycle defrost operation for the experimental ASHP unit is presented.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{performance}} of defrost systems applied to household refrigerators was experimentally evaluated through a purpose-built testing apparatus. The test bench is comprised of a calorimeter, a refrigerated cabinet and a humidifying system. Three distinct types of electrical heaters (distributed, calrod and glass tube) and three actuation modes (integral power, power steps and pulsing power) were investigated. The experiments were carried out under controlled conditions {{in order to ensure}} the same frost accumulation pattern over the evaporator. It was found that the <b>defrost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the three types of heaters is practically the same for each operating mode. The highest efficiency of approximately 48 % was obtained with the glass tube heater operating in power steps. However, this heater reached the highest temperature levels. The calrod heater seems to be the most appropriate not only because of its efficiency, which is compatible with the other options, but also due to its low cost and easy installation.

Investigation into the different defrost modes were carried out for chamber set point conditions of - 20, - 12, 0 oC, for a number of defrost rated inputs between 0. 5 and 3. 9 kW.

40|$|For an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit with a {{vertically}} installed multi-circuit outdoor coil, it is rarely {{possible to make}} the frost accumulations on each circuit's surface equal, leading to different frosting evenness values (FEVs) as a reverse cycle defrosting operation starts. On the other hand, uneven defrosting phenomenon was found and reported as many methods were developed to improve defrosting performance of ASHP systems, which may be attributable to the reverse cycle defrosting starting at an uneven frosting. Understanding of defrosting performance of an ASHP unit with a multi-circuit outdoor coil at different FEVs is of importance for ASHP units' application, but studies are scarce in the open literatures. In this paper, we report an experimental study on defrosting performance when frost accumulated on the surface of outdoor coil at different FEVs.

40|$|For an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit with a {{vertically}} installed multi-circuit outdoor coil, many parameters would affect system defrosting performance, especially the uneven distribution of refrigerant for each circuit and downwards flowing of melted frost {{due to gravity}} from up circuit(s) to down circuit(s). Currently, the negative effects of melted frost have been demonstrated and quantitatively studied, without however giving a fundamental study on the effects of uneven refrigerant distribution due to gravity and tube internal resistance for an ASHP unit with a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil.

40|$|When frost {{forms and}} accumulates over the outdoor coil's surface {{in an air}} source heat pump (ASHP) unit, system {{operating}} performance will be adversely affected. Currently, reverse cycle defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. A previous related study suggested that, for an ASHP unit with a multi-circuit outdoor coil, water collecting trays installed between circuits could eliminate the negative effects of downwards flowing melted frost due to gravity. However, for a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil with separations, there is also a lot of melted frost remained on the downside surface of each circuit due to surface tension. The remained water would consume energy, and thus deteriorate system defrosting performance. To quantitatively study the negative effects of surface tension, in this paper, an experimental study changing the vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil into horizontally installed in an ASHP unit was conducted. Compared with the surface tension kept, defrosting duration could be shorted from 186 s to 167 s, or 20 s less, and <b>defrosting</b> <b>efficiency</b> improved from 49. 4 % to 61. 4 %, or 12. 0 % more, when the remained water cleaned as the surface tension destroyed.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2013. Advisor: Francis A. Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 236, appendices A-G. Major: Mechanical Engineering. An important {{problem in the}} refrigeration industry is the formation and removal of frost layers on sub-freezing air coolers. The frost layer, a porous structure of ice and air, directly diminishes the performance and efficiency of the entire cooling system by presenting resistances to air flow and heat transfer in the air cooler. To return the system to pre-frosted performance the layer must be removed through a defrost cycle. The most common defrost cycle uses heat applied at the heat exchanger surfaces to melt the frost. Current methods of defrosting are inherently inefficient, {{with the majority of}} the heat being lost to the surrounding environment. Most studies have concentrated on the formation of the frost layer, and not the melting phenomena during the defrost cycle. In this study, direct measurements and a fundamental model to describe the melting process of a frost layer on a vertical heated surface are presented. The experimental facility provides the first direct measurements of heat and mass transfer during defrost. The measurements confirmed the multistage nature of defrost. The multistage model characterized the different thermal and mass transport processes that dominate each stage. The first stage is dominated by sensible heating of the frost layer. Both the experiment and model showed that heat and mass transfer through sublimation during the initial stages are insignificant, accounting for less than 1 % of the total energy transfer. The second stage of defrost is dominated by the melting of the frost layer. The melt rate model generally predicts the front velocity within 25 % of the velocity determined using the digital image analysis technique. Higher heat transfer rates resulted in faster melt velocity, and thus shortened defrost times. Evaporation of the melt liquid from the surface dominates the final stage. The heat transfer model for this stage predicts the heat transfer coefficient within Â± 25 % of the experiment. The overall <b>defrost</b> <b>efficiency</b> was found to be primarily dependent on the initial frost thickness, with thicker layer having less heat lost to the ambient space and a higher efficiency...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2017. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Francis Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 144 pages. Frost formation and anti-icing methods are studied {{in a variety}} of areas for decades. In refrigeration systems, a number of studies are focused on the influence of surface treatment on delaying the time of frost formation. There are far fewer studies on the effect of surface wettability on the defrost process. Some of the literature show experimental results on defrost time for different surfaces, but the results could be different based on individual experimental conditions. In this study, the influences of surface wettability on the defrost process are investigated analytically. The melting process is divided into three stages based on the behaviors of the meltwater. The water saturation and meltwater draining velocity are formulated for absorption and drainage stages separately. The comparison among the melting rate, the permeation rate, and the draining velocity determines the meltwater behavior, which influences the defrost process and defrost mechanisms. The slumping condition is a special phenomenon in the melting process and can be a potential method for frost removal. Water accumulation at the surface decreases the adherence strength of the frost column to the surface. A slumping criterion is formulated based on the analysis of interfacial forces and the body force on the frost column. The slumping condition of the model depends on the contact angle on hydrophilic surfaces and on the contact angle hysteresis on hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments of frost and defrost process on vertical surfaces with different wetting conditions are conducted on a lab-build setup. The experimental results show that <b>defrost</b> time and <b>efficiency</b> are determined by the system design, the heating methods, the heat flux applied at the surface and the surface wettability. Defrost mechanisms vary with surface wettability. During the defrost process, a frost column detaches from a superhydrophobic surface and falls off as a whole piece. While on the superhydrophilic and plain surfaces, frost melts, and water film or retention evaporates. <b>Defrost</b> time and <b>efficiency</b> are not significantly different on the tested surfaces at the point that frost melts and water film/retention droplets remain on the surfaces. However, <b>defrost</b> time and <b>efficiency</b> are improved noticeably on the superhyrophobic surface for a complete defrost process in which the water evaporation time is included. This research serves as a supplement to current studies on the effect of surface wettability in refrigeration systems. In application, the preference to the different surface wettability depends on the practical operation requirements and the actual system design...|$|R
40|$|Frost {{formation}} {{will occur}} when air-source heat pumps {{operate in a}} cold and humid climate. Defrosting is necessary since the frost lowers {{the performance of the}} heat pump. There are several methods for defrosting and it is usually carried out by heating from the inside of the tubes. The results from previous tests of heat pumps have shown that defrosting takes place even though not required. Unnecessary defrosts should be avoided since this is an energy demanding process and may cause wear of the heat pump. A method for optimized initiation or defrosting has been experimentally evaluated. The optimization was made for one cycle including frosting and defrosting. In this method defrosting is initiated when the maximum average COP is reached. The criterion for defrosting was applied on data from previous tests and the results showed a potential for improvement of COP as well as energy savings when using this optimization. The optimization can also be done regarding the cooling capacity which is of interest when the heat pump does not cover the whole heating requirement. The optimized control was tested in a climate chamber with a heat pump using hot gas defrost as defrosting method. The heat pump was also tested with the regular defrosting control. The tests were carried out at specified conditions for inlet air, + 2 Â°C with two different levels of humidity and - 7 Â°C. An evaluation according to SS-EN 255 - 2 was carried out for each test. The results from the optimized control did not come out as expected. It gave the best COP at - 7 Â°C but the regular control gave the better COP at + 2 Â°C. The optimized control {{turned out to be a}} sub optimization. It gives the maximal COP given a particular duration of defrosting. However, this COP may not necessarily be the best achievable with given heat pump and defrosting method. The optimized control showed a longer duration of defrosting for all tests and that contributes to the lower COP average. The cycle time was longer as well but it is limited by the frosting and was not able to compensate the longer defrosting. This was not the case in the one test with - 7 Â°C. When the optimized method was applied on data from the test with regular control, it shows room for improvement of COP in all tests, if the cycle time is prolonged. To reach the maximum COP in all conditions further optimization is necessary regarding <b>defrosting</b> duration and <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) {{operates}} in heating mode, frost can be accumulated {{on the surface}} of its finned outdoor coil. Frosting deteriorates the operation and energy efficiency of the ASHP and periodic defrosting becomes necessary. Currently the most widely used standard defrosting method for ASHPs is reverse cycle defrost. On the other hand, electronic expansion valves (EEVs) are commonly used in heat pump/refrigeration systems, including ASHP units, as throttle regulators of refrigerant flow. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the performance of a reverse cycle defrost operation for a 6. 5. kW experimental heating capacity residential ASHP whose outdoor coil had four-parallel refrigerant circuits, and with an EEV as the refrigerant flow throttle regulator. The detailed descriptions of the experimental ASHP unit and the experimental procedures of ASHP are firstly presented. This is followed by reporting the comparative experiments of two control strategies for the EEV to investigate their effects on defrosting performance: the EEV being fully open and the EEV being regulated by a degree of refrigerant superheat (DS) controller. Experimental results revealed that when the EEV was regulated by the DS controller during defrosting, a higher <b>defrosting</b> <b>efficiency</b> and less heat wastage would be resulted in.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{experimental study}} reported that the defrosting performance could be increased when the defrosting process started at a higher frosting evenness value (FEV) for an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit with a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil. In that study, to calculate the FEVs and thus fix the opening degrees of stop valves, melted frost of each circuit was collected by using water collecting trays installed between circuits. Thereafter, these trays were taken away to model a regular multi-circuit outdoor coil. However, during defrosting, the downward flowing melted frost from up circuit(s) along the surface of coil due to gravity would adversely affect the defrosting performance of down circuit(s). Different negative effects of downward flowing melted frost would make the effects of FEV on defrosting performance hard to qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed. Therefore, in this study, an experimental study on defrosting performance for an ASHP unit at different FEVs with melted frost local drainage was carried out. Finally, experimental results indicated that the defrosting duration could be shortened by about 11. 2 % and <b>defrosting</b> <b>efficiency</b> increased by about 5. 7 % as the FEV increased from 79. 4 % to 96. 6 %.

40|$|For an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit, reverse cycle {{defrosting}} operations are always conducted {{to solve the}} undesired frosting problem. Previous studies verified that, uneven refrigerant distribution (URD) and melted frost downwards flowing (MFDF) along the vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil would degrade system defrosting performance. However, it is hardly possible to separate the URD and MFDF effects in a practical multi-circuit outdoor coil. In addition, it is a fundamental coupled problem of uneven heat and mass transfer. Consequently, to investigate the coupled effects of MFDF and URD on system defrosting performance, a sequential experimental study is carried out and reported in this paper. Firstly, a special testing facility and tailor-made three-circuit outdoor coil were introduced. This is followed by two experimental cases designed, with frost evenly accumulated on the surface of each circuit by adjusting the stop valvesâ€™ opening degrees. After the experimental results compared, basing on refrigerant evenly and unevenly distributed into each circuit, energy analysis was also given.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{is used for}} space heating at a low ambient {{temperature}} in winter, frost may be formed on its outdoor coil surface. Over time, frost accumulation on coil surface may become sufficient to restrict air passage through the coil and increase the heat transfer resistance between ambient air and coil surface, leading to performance degradation for the outdoor coil, or even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for an ASHP unit is reverse cycle defrosting. During a standard reverse cycle defrosting (SRCD) operation, the indoor coil in an ASHP unit actually acts as an evaporator. Because the indoor fan is usually turned off during defrosting, there is an insignificant amount of energy from indoor coil, leading to a number of associated operational problems such as a longer defrosting duration and the risk of having a lower air temperature inside a heated space during defrosting, etc. To solve the fundamental problem of insufficient heat available during defrosting while ensuring the efficient and safe system operation, a novel reverse cycle defrosting (NRCD) method which is thermal energy storage-based using sub-cooling energy of refrigerant for ASHPs has been developed. Comparative experiments using both the SRCD method and the NRCD method were carried out on an experimental ASHP unit with a nominal 2. 5 kW heating capacity. Experimental results clearly suggested that when using the NRCD method, the discharge and suction pressures were increased by 0. 56 and 0. 12 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the defrosting duration and heating-resumption duration were shortened by 30. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, and the defrosting energy consumption was reduced by 13. 9 %, compared to those when using the SRCD method. Practical application: ASHPs have been widely used worldwide due to their significant energy-saving potentials. However, frost can be formed on the outdoor coil surface when an ASHP unit operates for space heating. Frost accumulation on coil surface reduces the coil's efficiency, or causes even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Reverse cycle defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. This paper presents the reverse cycle defrosting performance for an ASHP unit with a PCM-HE acting as both a sub-cooler during heating operation and a heat source during defrosting operation, which could help to ensure the safe operation and achieve a higher <b>defrosting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the ASHP unit.
