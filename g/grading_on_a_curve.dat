40|$|The {{provision}} of non-pecuniary incentives in {{education is a}} topic that has received much scholarly attention lately. Our paper contributes to this discussion by investigating the effectiveness of grade incentives in increasing student performance. We perform a direct comparison {{of the two most}} commonly used grading practices: the absolute (i. e., criterion-referenced) and the relative (i. e., norm-referenced) grading schemes in a large-scale field experiment at a university. We hypothesize that relative grading, by creating a rank-order tournament in the classroom, provides stronger incentives for male students than absolute grading. In the full sample, we find weak support for our hypothesis. Among the more motivated students we find evidence that men indeed score significantly higher on the test when graded on a curve. Female students, irrespective of their motivation, do not increase their scores under relative grading. Since women slightly outperform men under absolute grading, <b>grading</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>curve</b> actually narrows the gender gap in performance...|$|E

Our main conclusion is that if students care primarily about their status (relative rank) in class, they are often best motivated to work not by revealing their exact numerical exam scores (100, 99, [...] ., 1), but instead by clumping them into coarse categories (A,B,C). When student abilities are disparate, the optimal absolute grading scheme is always coarse. Furthermore, it awards fewer A’s than there are alpha-quality students, creating small elites. When students are homogeneous, we characterize optimal absolute grading schemes {{in terms of the}} stochastic dominance between student performances (when they shirk or work) on subintervals of scores, show­ing again why coarse grading may be advantageous.

Both effects are large and do not disappear after the first semester, but non-English speaking background predicts substantially more of a reduction in marks than international student status.

How should the employer combine both incentive devices to generate an optimal pay schedule? When workers' abilities are disparate, the optimal wage schedule creates different grades than we found with status incentives alone. The very top type should be motivated solely by money, with enormous salaries going to a tiny elite. Furthermore, if the population of workers diminishes as we go up the ability ladder and their disutility for work does not fall as fast, then the optimal wage schedule exhibits increasing wage differentials, despite the linearity in production. When workers are homogeneous, the same status grades are optimal as we found with status incentives alone. A bonus is paid only to scores in the top status grade.

40|$|Various political, economic, {{and social}} changes {{within the past}} 20 years have been {{accompanied}} by a myriad of novel ethical questions and concerns {{that are relevant to}} teaching. For example, technological advances (e. g., text readers, computer programs, etc.) have led to an increased number of students attending colleges and universities who might otherwise have been excluded from that opportunity due to a physical disability. Although the inclusion of these students has led to a richer and more diverse learning environment, a number of ethical (and indeed legal) questions arise as {{to the extent to which}} an instructor must adapt basic core requirements to accommodate the needs of any individual student while maintaining an equitable learning environment for other students in the class. In addition, faculty members are aware of the potential political and legal consequences of their actions now more than ever. This situation creates an environment of increased accountability and performance. On the other hand, it may be argued that the consequences have led some instructors to adopt decisions that are based more <b>on</b> <b>a</b> perceived need to reduce the risk of sanctions than on moral values. In an attempt to respond to teaching-related ethical dilemmas such as those just described, we sought colleague consultation and looked for guidance in the literature. As psychologists, we examined the codes of ethics of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations, both of which contain sections directly pertaining to teaching. Although each of the codes' principles present general direction for ethical teaching practices, there appeared to be no specific guidance with respect to many questions faced by those who teach. Furthermore, Tabachnick, Keith-Spiegel, and Pope (1991) cited a number of concerns that are only rarely addressed in the literature (e. g., <b>grading</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> strict <b>curve</b> regardless of class performance level, selling unwanted complimentary textbooks to used book vendors). This paucity of direction led us to the idea of guest editing a special issue addressing teaching-related ethical concerns that have not been addressed extensively in the literature to date. Clearly, it would be impossible to address every specific situation that might arise in terms of the ethics of teaching. We hope, however, that the articles contained in this issue will promote further discussion and investigation with regard to recurring ethical concerns. We also hope that this special issue will facilitate decision making and illustrate that other instructors and academics may experience dilemmas that are similar to those of many readers...|$|R
40|$|When we {{released}} our inaugural Report Card on State Price Transparency Laws in 2013, it was {{the first}} time policy makers, consumer advocates, and other health care leaders had a comprehensive resource showing how readily consumers could find health care prices in every state across the country. With so many states earning only a failing grade, it was clear a lot more action had to be taken by states to ensure consumers have reliable information on which to make important health care decisions. We were pleased, therefore, to see the 2013 Report Card start a dialogue and in some cases, prompt lawmakers to introduce legislation, even if some bills were not voted into law. With consumers taking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rising share of their health care costs, access to meaningful price information is more important than ever. In this year's Report Card, we decided to raise the bar, no longer <b>grading</b> state laws <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>curve,</b> as we did in 2013. We also decided to take a deeper look at whether these laws were achieving the ultimate goal [...] ensuring consumers have access to meaningful information about the price of their health care. For this reason, we expanded the scope of our inquiry to examine not only state laws on the books, but also states' price transparency regulations, price transparency websites, and all-payer claims databases, the ideal source of data for these websites. Some states have robust price transparency laws and regulations, requiring them to create a publicly available website with price information based on real paid claims information; but in reality, the public can't readily access that information because the website is poorly designed, or poorly functioning. Given that so many state-mandated websites are inadequate, once we included websites into our review and grading, no state received an "A" in this year's Report Card. Unfortunately, New Hampshire [...] a state that received an A in last year's Report Card [...] dropped to an F this year, because its website is inoperative and may remain so for an extended period. Several states have "voluntary price transparency websites," hosted by hospital associations, foundations, or nonprofits. While these sites can be a valuable resource to consumers, if they are not legislated they can be short-lived, dependent on the good will and resources of the organization that hosts them. For this reason, we did not factor in these websites when awarding the 2014 state grades; however, we did provide a review of them in Appendix I for comparison purposes. This Report Card on State Price Transparency Laws is a joint effort between Catalyst for Payment Reform and Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute to examine consumers' access to price information in all 50 states, using well-defined grading criteria applied to laws, regulations, and state-mandated websites.

40|$|In {{tertiary}} {{institutions in}} Australia, {{and no doubt}} elsewhere, there is increasing pressure for accountability. No longer are academics assumed a priori to be responsible and capable of self management in teaching and assessing the subjects they run. Procedures are being dictated more from the ‘top down’. Although academics may not always appreciate ‘top down’ policies on teaching and learning, they should at least {{be open to the}} possibility that the policies may indeed have merit. On the other hand, academics should never be expected to blindly accept policies dictated from elsewhere. Responsible academics generally also need to evaluate for themselves the validity and legitimacy of externally introduced new policies and procedures. At one Australian tertiary institution, the Academic Board recently endorsed a new assessment policy, to implement criterion referenced assessment (CRA) throughout the university. This new policy is being promoted by the university’s teaching and learning support services and is to be implemented gradually throughout the university. As stated in the university’s manual of policies and procedures (MOPP) the ‘fundamental approach’ to the assessment of students was to be one based on ‘criterion referencing’. Such Assessment was to be free of any notion of awarding <b>grades</b> dependent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bell <b>curve,</b> and the criteria against which a student’s work was to be assessed would have to be communicated in a detailed and clear way in advance of the actual assessment. Thus, for each piece of assessment, criteria must be given to students, with performance standards for each criteria detailing clearly what standard must be reached on each criterion to achieve a certain result. It is stated in the MOPP that CRA will give the assessment process ‘a great deal of objectivity’ and will contribute to the ‘reliability and validity of the assessment task’. Moreover, it is stated that high, but attainable, standards will ‘motivate students and focus their energy on learning rather than on competition with peers’. The teaching team of the final year Information Technology Project Management subject had a strong commitment to continuous improvement processes in the presentation and running of the subject. Given that the university had endorsed a new assessment policy that would soon relate to third year courses, the team decided to apply for, and were subsequently awarded, a faculty grant to implement and test the possible benefits of the endorsed CRA policy. An independent project, funded at faculty level, was undertaken to evaluate the effect of the new assessment policy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> final year unit. The project took a team-based approach to studying the use and effectiveness of criterion referenced assessment. All seven members of the unit’s teaching and marking groups were included in the decision making surrounding the design, development, and implementation of CRA and an environment was created in which the team members could openly communicate their experience of CRA. Members of the group initially held a variety of beliefs about CRA that ranged from a dismissal of CRA as merely the latest teaching and learning fad, to keen interest in how it might practically operate in the unit. This diversity of thought was regarded as valuable and in keeping with the attempt to take an impartial ‘warts and all’ view of the CRA implementation, noting equally its positive and negative impacts. It was found that many of the purported advantages attributed in the literature to CRA were not forthcoming. Moreover, some unexpected results were uncovered. While prior research suggests that CRA's failures are due to implementation errors, our work suggests that {{the real problem is that}} the assumptions behind CRA are flawed.
