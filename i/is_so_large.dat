5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>large</b> that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>large</b> that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>large</b> that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>large</b> and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

25|$|Quite often, {{textbook}} {{problems will}} treat the population standard deviation {{as if it}} were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student's t-distribution.
