40|$|A sensitive, specific, {{high-performance}} liquld-chromatographic {{method for}} {{the determination of}} <b>iosulamide</b> in plasma and urine is described. The method {{was used to determine}} pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>iosulamide</b> after Intravenous administration to rhesus monkeys. The mean (±SE) distribution and disposition half-lives were 0. 19 (± 0. 03) and 1. 5 (± 0. 3) hr, respectively. The mean (±SE) model-dependent and model-independent volumes of distribution at steady state were 0. 41 (± 0. 078) and 0. 49 (± 0. 039) liters/kg, respectively. Total urinary excretion of <b>iosulamide</b> represented a mean (±SE) of 1 2. 5 (±O. 6) % of the administered dose and was virtually complete in 3 hr. The results of the pharmacokinetic study indicate that <b>iosulamide</b> is rapidly cleared from the body and that renal clearance is a minor route of elimination from the body. lodinated radiopaque media have been widely used for diag-nostic purposes, to provide visualization of internal structures, fo...|$|E
