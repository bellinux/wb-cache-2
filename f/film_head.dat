50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the head gap that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin <b>film</b> <b>heads.</b> Thin <b>film</b> <b>heads</b> were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin <b>film</b> <b>heads</b> were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin <b>film</b> <b>heads</b> allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|R
