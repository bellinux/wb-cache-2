We walked into Jon Avnet’s office that first day and he said, ‘What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> the production?’ and we said $3million.

[...] A meeting was duly arranged.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must speak}} {{a little more}} plainly," [...] Wolfenden said; [...] "you are {{altogether}} too vague. What help <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> and <b>for</b> what purpose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You want money," [...] the {{solicitor}} said in surprise. [...] "What {{on earth}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> money <b>for?</b> and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it why don't you ask your mother for it? How much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here are {{the twenty}} pounds each, in gold, lads," [...] Colonel Warrener said, [...] "that I told you I could get for <b>you.</b> Now what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it <b>for?</b> <b>You</b> would {{not tell me}} at Cawnpore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That looks feasible. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, {{and coffee}} {{will be all}} that is necessary, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, Hubbard! I {{beg your}} pardon. If you say it's all right, I am {{bound to be}} satisfied. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’How much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> ’im?’ ses Ted Reddish, arter Ginger ’ad got ’is leg away, {{and taken}} {{it to the}} winder to look at it.|$|E
6000|$|He did not answer, {{but said}} in his heart: [...] "All right; if I'm a child of four, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>for?</b> I don't <b>want</b> another mother." [...] But he said nothing to her, and there was silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fortunate," [...] said Drakesford. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a gun <b>for,</b> anyway? Plugging one of {{the troopers}} wouldn't help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> {{remember}} that, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know <b>for,</b> Una? You can't possibly recollect your Torquay visit, surely!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{are three}} or four others quite as good," [...] Jerry said carelessly. [...] "Now, chief, how many blankets, how much powder and lead, and what else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> those two horses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hey-day!' {{interposed}} Mr. Mann, 'I suppose you're {{going to}} say that <b>you</b> <b>DO</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> something, now? Why, you little wretch--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What {{the thunder}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your {{trousers}} <b>for,</b> {{in the middle}} of the night?” he asked indignantly. “Why don’t you lie down, and go to sleep?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are two {{meetings}} {{pretty well}} every day,' one said, 'sometimes three, {{and a man}} cannot be at them all. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> him <b>for?</b> If {{it is to get}} money out of him, you won't find the job a very easy one, unless he has happened to strike on a vein of luck. You had much better take the odds from me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak for yourself, sir!" [...] she leaped lightly from Mrs. Beale. [...] "I'm {{good and}} I'm clever. What more <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> <b>For</b> you, I'll spare your blushes {{and not be}} personal--I'll simply say that you're as {{handsome}} as you can stick together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{be welcome}} {{everywhere}} for her sake. She {{is a kind}} mistress, and greatly beloved. It is a pity that she married a Russian, though they say {{he is a good}} fellow. Tell me, can I do anything for you? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The rider drew rein and the {{landlord}} introduced {{me as the}} man who was in need of a mount. Each moment my desire to own the horse deepened, but I was afraid to show even approval. [...] "How much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> him?" [...] I asked indifferently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do hate books," [...] she continued. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be <b>for</b> ever {{talking about}} your feelings? That's what I can't make out. And poetry's all about feelings--novels are all about feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Bill, 'he's ugly enough. He looks fierce. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a dog, he's {{the sort}} of dog <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> one <b>for?</b> It seems to me it's {{a lot of trouble}} to take, when there's no need of any trouble at all. Why not do what I've always wanted to do? What's wrong with just fixing the dog, same as it's always done, and walking in and helping yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> my help <b>for?</b> What {{have you}} been doing?" [...] Staniford paused, and {{suddenly}} added: [...] "Have you been making love to Lurella?" [...] He said this in his ironical manner, but his smile was rather ghastly.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've had {{something}} else to do than to get book-learning." [...] said Mr. Cohen,--"I've had to make myself knowing about useful things. I know stones well,"--here he pointed to Deronda's ring. [...] "I'm not afraid of taking that ring of yours at my own valuation. But now," [...] he added, with a certain drop in his voice to a lower, more familiar nasal, [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want them, and I <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> I haven't {{the heart}} to drag Uncle out anymore, and you know I never go with any gentleman but those of my own family." ...|$|R
6000|$|He did {{not like}} the {{intelligence}} of their meeting, and hoped no one had seen it; then, when reassured on this score, he hummed a little and exclaimed, 'Poor old Flossy Houghton!

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mrs. Condrip confessed, [...] "I {{do think}} it dangerous; but how can I speak of him otherwise? I dare say, I admit, that I shouldn't speak of him at all. Only I <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> once, as I said just now, to know." ...|$|R

[...] "How much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>for</b> that gold apple of yours, girl?" [...] said she, opening the window. [...] "It can't be bought either for gold or money," [...] {{answered}} the girl. [...] "If it cannot be bought either for gold or money, what will buy it? You may say what you please," [...] said the Princess.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Baby' is {{eighteen}} {{and has a}} beau," [...] laughed Esme. [...] "And I give you fair warning that she insists on being called Laura now. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to come <b>for</b> a walk with me--down under the beeches to the old lane gate? I came out {{to see if the}} fresh air would do my bit of a headache good. I shall have to help with the supper later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awfully {{sorry you}} won't marry Roy," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a sister. But you are quite right. He would bore you to death. I love him, {{and he is}} a dear sweet boy, but really he isn't a bit interesting. He looks as if he ought to be, but he isn't." ...|$|R
