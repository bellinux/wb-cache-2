5|$|The Mutoscope {{worked on}} the same {{principle}} as a flip book, with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user-operated <b>hand</b> <b>crank.</b> The cards were lit by electric light bulbs inside the machine, a system devised by Arthur Marvin's brother, Henry, {{one of the founders}} of the Biograph company. Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{prepared}} old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, {{which may}} be prepared by simply adding cold water to the mix. Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a <b>hand</b> <b>crank,</b> drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the <b>hand</b> <b>crank.</b> The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E

25|$|Kitchen pasta machines, {{also called}} pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make {{large amounts of}} fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand, and by turning a <b>hand</b> <b>crank,</b> extrudes the pasta through a machine 'comb' that shapes the pasta noodles as they are extruded.|$|E
25|$|The main antenna {{consisted}} of two lead weighted 120-meter-long wires deployed by electric motor or <b>hand</b> <b>crank.</b> The emergency antenna was a 40-meter wire stretched from a ring on the airship hull. Three high-quality, six-tube receivers served the wavelength ranges 120 to 1,200m (medium frequency), 400 to 4,000m (low frequency) and 3,000 to 25,000m (overlapping low frequency and very low frequency). The radio room also had a shortwave receiver for wavelengths 10 to 280m (high frequency).|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a small <b>hand</b> <b>crank</b> (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the <b>hand</b> <b>crank</b> would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline cars became ever {{easier to}} operate {{thanks to the}} {{invention}} of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a <b>hand</b> <b>crank</b> for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks {{to the use of the}} muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, most {{winemaking}} technology advances {{were made}} by religious orders (particularly in France and Germany) who owned vast amounts of vineyard land and produced large quantities of wines in their abbeys and bishoprics. It was here that the basket press became popular. The press included large cylindrical basket made of wood staves bound together by wood or metal rings with a heavy horizontal disc fitted at the top. After the grapes were loaded into the basket, the disc would depress towards the bottom with juice seeping out between the staves into a waiting basin or tray. In some presses, added pressure would come from a giant lever or manual <b>hand</b> <b>crank.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{automobile}} self-starter is {{an electric}} motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the <b>hand</b> <b>crank</b> used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, {{but none of them}} were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of {{an electric motor}} attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.|$|E
25|$|Later, timpani {{were adopted}} into other {{classical}} music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Unlike concert timpani, marching versions had fiberglass shells {{to make them}} light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a <b>hand</b> <b>crank.</b> Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and performed more like conventional timpani, yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations' allowance for timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This {{was the beginning of}} the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage. Timpani are still used by the Mounted Bands of the Household Division of the British Army.|$|E
500|$|To {{assist in}} moving objects around the {{exterior}} of the station during EVAs, Mir featured two Strela cargo cranes mounted to the sides of the core module, used for moving spacewalking cosmonauts and parts. The cranes consisted of telescopic poles assembled in sections which measured around [...] when collapsed, but when extended using a <b>hand</b> <b>crank</b> were [...] long, meaning that all of the station's modules could easily be accessed during spacewalks.|$|E
5000|$|Even in {{the silent}} film era, films were shown with sounds, often with musical accompaniment by a pianist or an {{orchestra}} keeping time with the screen action. The first synchronization was a turning recording device marked with a white spot. As the white spot rotated, the cameraman <b>hand</b> <b>cranked</b> the camera {{to keep it in}} sync with the recording. The method was then repeated for playback, but with the projectionist <b>hand</b> <b>cranking</b> the film projector. [...] "Single-system" [...] sound recorded sound optically to part of the original camera film, or magnetically to a stripe of magnetic coating along the film edge.|$|R
