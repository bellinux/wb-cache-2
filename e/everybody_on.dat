25|$|Until 2002, the UDF spanned a {{somewhat}} wide ideological spectrum on the centre-right. A tongue-in-cheek characterisation of UDF's membership {{is that it}} was the union of <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> the right that was neither far-right nor a Chirac supporter. However, the UDF suffered for its lack of cohesion, in contrast to the RPR. The economic policies proposed by UDF's leaders ranged from left-leaning, in favor of social justice, to strongly laissez-faire economics. Such divergences led the laissez-faire advocates of Liberal Democracy, such as Alain Madelin, to split out of UDF on 16 May 1998. This departure followed the elections of UDF politicians for the presidents of 4 regional councils with the votes of FN elects. Indeed, the Liberals refused to condemn these alliances.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the final}} episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> the set was excited {{in a manner that}} she likened to {{students}} {{on the last day of}} school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces on her toes at the end of the [...] "fake crying" [...] talking head, and she taps the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx.|$|E

500|$|In {{describing}} the album, Clarke said, [...] "Technically, it's a Stanley Clarke record, but it's {{very much a}} band-oriented record at the same time". Comparing the album to a ship, he said, [...] "I'd be the one steering the ship and keeping <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> course. But all hands were definitely on deck, and everyone {{played an important role}} in getting us to our destination". Clarke has said that this will be his last electric album for a while. Clarke co-produced the album with Lenny White who played drums on Clarke's 2009 album Jazz in the Garden.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. <b>Everybody</b> <b>on</b> the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|Woods {{continued}} {{to excel in}} 2007 and {{the first part of}} 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour. Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18 hole playoff, after which Mediate said, [...] "This guy does things that are just not normal {{by any stretch of the}} imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> one leg." [...] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it [...] "my greatest ever championship." [...] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie.

500|$|Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene {{were then}} called by Nosanchuk. George Darby {{told the court}} that in his conversations with Lamb the {{defendant}} had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E
500|$|A promotional teaser was {{released}} before the full {{release of the}} video; it saw Roberts walking on the New York City pavements, {{with a pair of}} backing dancers gaining looks from men. It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time. I liked it, and <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> the team liked it on the day. It was 120 degrees, so anything longer, I'd have died." ...|$|E

500|$|Sports journalists Damien Cox and Stephen Brunt {{wrote about}} Bure during the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs {{that he was}} a [...] "two-way dynamo," [...] {{accounting}} for [...] "several bodychecks he handed out on the night" [...] and for his defensive abilities as he stayed on the ice in the last minutes of a one-goal playoff match against the Toronto Maple Leafs. They spoke highly of his creativity as well, recognizing him as [...] "someone who sees in his game a world of possibilities that just never occur to others," [...] praising his [...] "sheer elegance and imagination" [...] and characterizing his hockey sense as [...] "ho-hum brilliance from the most explosive player in the sport". Brunt called him [...] "a , a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Charlie Parker". During the 1993-94 season, Bure demonstrated his strong playmaking abilities, helping linemate and friend Gino Odjick score a career-high 16 goals in a single season, more than twice the number of goals Odjick would score in any other year separated from Bure, and doubling his career goal totals up to that point in his career. According to teammate Cliff Ronning in 1994, [...] "we play a much sounder game defensively when Pavel's flying, as he was in the first period". Former Canuck teammate Jyrki Lumme spoke of Bure as a player and teammate, [...] "That guy does something spectacular every time ... it's frustrating to go against him in practice because he's all over the place. He makes <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> our team better." ...|$|E
