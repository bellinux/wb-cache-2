This report documents an approach that provides precise, coordinated maneuver control during excursions from a hypersonic cruise <b>ight</b> path and observes the necessary <b>ight</b> condition constraints. The approach istoachieve speci ed guidance commands by resolving altitude and cross-range errors into a load factor and bank angle command by using a coordinate transformation that acts as an interface between outer- and inner-loop <b>ight</b> controls. This interface, referred to as a, &quot; applies constraints on angle-of-attack and dynamic pressure perturbations while prioritizing altitude regulation over cross range. An unpiloted test simulation, in which the resolver was used to drive inner-loop <b>ight</b> controls, produced time histories of responses to guidance commands and atmospheric disturbances at Mach numbers of 6, 10, 15, and 20. These time histories are used to illustrate {{the manner in which the}} overall control system incorporates <b>ight</b> condition constraints and accounts for high-speed <b>ight</b> e ects.
