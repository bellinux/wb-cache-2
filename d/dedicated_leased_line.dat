40|$|Security {{decisions}} {{are based on}} a number of foundational assumptions. The effectiveness of any decision depends on the soundness of the underlying assumptions. To ensure that security is adequate and will work, these assumptions need to be examined. Any time we hear that "A" is secure (or insecure) because of "B", we need to ask some questions. Why that is true? How do we know? What do we know about "B" that makes "A" secure or not? This questioning must be done without bias and without assuming that the conclusion is known in advance. One assumption frequently heard is that a wide area network (WAN) is secure because its sites are linked using <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> Many people believe that these lines are inherently secure. Some providers of these lines certainly advertise them as secure. It is unsound to assume without question that <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> are secure. This paper examines the properties of <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and the reality about their security. The main focus is the risk of loss of secrecy of information transmitted on <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> (The discussion of other aspects of security of <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the analysis and risk-mitigation related to loss of service, will be left to others.) This paper reviews the evolution of <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and discusses how this influences their security. It examines the decisions made by telephone companies in response to competitive pressures and how these decisions may impact security. The examples here are commonly used point-to-point services with DS 1 and DS 3 lines (T 1 and T 3). Not discussed is the security of the end-points, which is essentially the same irrespective of the line type.

As a result, fast and accurate centralized control of femtocells is not possible. Therefore, horizontal handovers between femtocells {{are difficult to}} arrange, and vertical handover to overlaying macrocell is supported instead. Furthermore, due to privacy reasons the femtocell access can be restricted to household members.

When the connection used a telecommunications provider, the connections were called a <b>dedicated,</b> <b>leased,</b> or private <b>line.</b> The ARPANET used <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> to provide point-to-point data links between its packet-switching nodes, which were called Interface Message Processors.|$|R
5000|$|IPTV {{delivers}} television content using signals {{based on}} the Internet protocol (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the [...] "last-mile" [...] telecom company acting only as the Internet service provider (ISP). As described above, [...] "Internet television" [...] is [...] "over-the-top technology" [...] (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a packet-switched network to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system—a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company. In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional circuit switched analog or digital television channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both {{the old and new}} systems, subscribers have set-top boxes or other customer-premises equipment that communicates directly over company-owned or <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to limited}} crew {{availability}} to support {{science and the}} large number of experiments to be operated simultaneously, telescience is key to a successful International Space Station (ISS) science program. Crew, operations personnel at NASA centers, and researchers at universities and companies around the world must work closely together to per orm scientific experiments on-board ISS. The deployment of reliable high-speed Internet Protocol (IP) -based networks promises to greatly enhance telescience capabilities. These networks are now being used to cost-effectively extend the reach of remote mission support systems. They reduce the need for <b>dedicated</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and travel while improving distributed workgroup collaboration capabilities. NASA has initiated use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to supplement the existing mission voice communications system used by researchers at their remote sites. The Internet Voice Distribution System (IVoDS) connects remote researchers to mission support "loopsll or conferences via NASA networks and Internet 2. Researchers use NODS software on personal computers to talk with operations personnel at NASA centers. IVoDS also has the;capability, if authorized, to allow researchers to communicate with the ISS crew during experiment operations. NODS was developed by Marshall Space Flight Center with contractors & Technology, First Virtual Communications, Lockheed-Martin, and VoIP Group. NODS is currently undergoing field-testing with full deployment for up to 50 simultaneous users expected in 2002. Research is being performed in parallel with IVoDS deployment for a next-generation system to qualitatively enhance communications among ISS operations personnel. In addition to the current voice capability, video and data/application-sharing capabilities are being investigated. IVoDS technology is also being considered for mission support systems for programs such as Space Launch Initiative and Homeland Defense...|$|R
50|$|In electronics, {{a circuit}} is a path between {{two or more}} points along which an {{electrical}} current can be carried. (A circuit breaker is a device that interrupts the path when necessary to protect other devices attached to the circuit - for example, {{in case of a}} power surge.)  In telecommunications, a circuit is a discrete (specific) path between two or more points along which signals can be carried. Unless otherwise qualified, a circuit is a physical path, consisting of one or more wires (or wireless paths) and possibly intermediate switching points. A network is an arrangement of circuits. In a dial-up (switched) connection, a circuit is reserved for use by one user {{for the duration of the}} calling session. In a <b>dedicated</b> or <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> arrangement, a circuit is reserved in advance and can only be used by the owner or renter of the circuit.|$|R
40|$|The paper evolves a data {{transfer}} mechanism, {{with a view}} to arrive at the best performance in the minimum bandwidth path of a wired Virtual Private Network (VPN). It orients to establish a service similar to that of a private <b>dedicated</b> network with <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> for the endpoints of the VPN. The methodology adequately provisions the hose model of the VPN to allow an acclaimed degree of performance across a shared architecture. The data packets are routed through independent paths in order to ensure secure communication among the network users in the customer sites. The scheme attempts to extricate an admirable class of service over transfer of increasing data size and project its large scale communicating capability. It includes NS 2 based simulation results to illustrate the merits of the developed methodology and reveal the suitability of VPN for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} data transfer scheme {{with a view to}} sufficiently provision the hose model of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and accomplish the desired degree of performance. The basic idea is to extract a service comparable to that of a private <b>dedicated</b> network with <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> for the endpoints of the VPN. The service providers are expected to guarantee the required bandwidth, in order to address Quality of Service (QoS) issues while employing a VPN over a shared network. Thus a tree based mechanism is generated through which well defined resource management procedures are devised to optimize the available bandwidth. The data packets forwarded through such predetermined paths serve to ensure secure communication between customer sites. The NS 2 based simulation results are included to demonstrate the merits of the designed approach and highlight the suitability of VPN for real time applications...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{and compares}} various techniques for creating corporate Wide Area Networks (WANs), based on Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology. VPN {{technology is the}} comprehensive term for techniques that use public or shared networks for connecting sites or users together. VPNs can be contrasted with actual private networks, created by a system of owned or <b>leased</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>lines.</b> The main benefits of VPNs over private networks are {{that they are more}} scalable and reduce costs, without impairing security. VPNs can be categorized as either secure or trusted VPNs, Customer Edge (CE) or Provider Edge (PE) based VPNs, or client-based or web-based VPNs. These categories often overlap each other. The main purpose of the report is to serve as a basis when choosing among VPN technologies. The report will show that a combination of technologies (i. e. a hybrid solution) is usually the best solution. Säker företagskommunikation över VPN-baserade WA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. If {{your company}} is like most {{businesses}}, you lease equipment. A U. S. Department of Commerce report states that 80 % of all businesses lease equipment. Leasing {{is one of}} many financial tools available to businesses whether they are publicly traded corporations or family owned private companies. Leased assets include the full range of equipment necessary for a company to conduct business. Our research indicates that there are three areas in which all companies can improve their leasing processes, decrease total financing costs and save time. To accomplish this, companies need to understand the language of leasing, improve their lease negotiation skills and develop more detailed RFPs that include enhanced lease requirement sections. Very large organizations with extensive annual leasing needs should consider a RFP that is entirely <b>dedicated</b> to <b>leasing.</b> This RFP is separate from the equipment request and only deals with the financing. Many municipalities, corporations, service businesses and not-for-profits seek out a <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit that will cover all equipment acquired during a specific period of time, usually a calendar or fiscal year. The <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit may be renewed annually if both parties are satisfied with the working relationship. Using a <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit means a company negotiates a Master Lease document only once, saving valuable staff and legal time investments. Companies who choose to use this approach should have a well organized budgeting process, accurate product and market forecast models and open channels of communication between procurement, finance and operations...|$|R
50|$|An Internet <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> is {{a premium}} {{internet}} connectivity product, normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical speeds with full duplex. It {{is also known}} as an ethernet <b>leased</b> <b>line,</b> <b>dedicated</b> line, data circuit or private line. For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24 DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice communications, or multiplex the channels into a single data circuit. <b>Leased</b> <b>lines,</b> as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.|$|R
