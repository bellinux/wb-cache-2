Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program <b>know</b> <b>most</b> of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we <b>know</b> <b>most</b> about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E
500|$|Etymologiae {{presents}} in abbreviated form much of {{that part}} of the learning of antiquity that Christians thought worth preserving. Etymologies, often very far-fetched, form the subject of just one of the encyclopedia's twenty books (Book X), but perceived linguistic similarities permeate the work. An idea of the quality of Isidore's etymological knowledge is given by Peter Jones: [...] "Now we <b>know</b> <b>most</b> of his derivations are total nonsense (eg, he derives baculus, 'walking-stick', from Bacchus, god of drink, because you need one to walk straight after sinking a few)".|$|E

500|$|A [...] "supreme {{defensive}} shortstop", Rollins has {{won four}} Gold Glove Awards, and only Omar Vizquel {{has a better}} fielding percentage among shortstops who have played at least 10 seasons. Rollins attributes some of his defensive prowess to experience, noting that he has played in MLB for a long enough time to <b>know</b> <b>most</b> hitters' tendencies and {{to learn how to}} read swings, both of which help him appropriately position himself to get to as many balls as possible. In their 2011 season preview, Lindy's Sports commented that Rollins is an upper-echelon shortstop [...] "with soft hands, excellent agility and plus range left and right", going on to praise his strong throwing arm, especially from the hole.|$|E

Angus said the options were not to deliver the message that fans would need to purchase all covers.

One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of {{his days as a}} barrier-breaker. [...] "You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name.

500|$|Gillard, as a Member of Parliament, {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have legalised {{same-sex}} marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated [...] "the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman" [...] and that marriage being between a man and woman [...] "has a special status". The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the [...] "course of human history now is that we are going to see same-sex marriage here and in, you <b>know,</b> <b>most</b> parts of the developed world." [...] She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{entering}} the campaign with relatively low poll numbers, the NDP recovered and increased their support significantly after Layton's {{performance in the}} leaders debates.

The Globe and Mail described Layton's attack as a [...] "knock-out punch" [...] while the Toronto Star stated it was the [...] "pivot in the debate [...] {{was a turning point}} in the federal campaign".

Lead writer Darby McDevitt said that Revelations, won't answer all the burning questions clouding the series, stating [...] "Well, we won't answer everything because Desmond's story continues. But fans will definitely <b>know</b> <b>most</b> of the important details of Ezio and Altair's lives, and how they fit into the grand scheme." [...] McDevitt also stated that 85 percent of Assassin's Creed's overarching plot is already [...] "mapped out". McDevitt claimed original Creed protagonist Altair had his story arc written for two years, and that Ezio's ultimate fate was planned during the development of Brotherhood.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Hyun Jin Kim {{suggested}} that [...] "from the names {{that we do}} <b>know,</b> <b>most</b> of which seem to be Turkic... the Hunnic elite was predominantly Turkic-speaking." [...] He also suggests that the Xiongnu, who had originally spoken Yeniseian, flipped to Oghur Turkic when they absorbed the Dingling and crossed into Central Asia, like the later Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate. He noted that, beside Hunnic, people in Attila's court also spoke Gothic and Latin, {{and that in the}} western part of the Empire, where subjected Goths lived, people described as Huns probably spoke both the Hunnic and Gothic languages. An example would be the Germanic or Germanized names of noted Huns like Laudaricus.|$|E
2500|$|Panizza's first {{collection}} of fiction, Dämmrungsstücke, appeared in 1890, received a modest amount of critical acclaim {{in the press}} and brought him to the attention of Germany's leading literary figures.

They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out.

2500|$|The Liberals had {{considerable}} momentum when the writ was dropped, and Ignatieff successfully squeezed NDP leader Jack Layton out of media attention, by issuing challenges to Harper for one-on-one debates. In {{the first couple}} weeks of the campaign, Ignatieff kept his party in {{second place in the}} polls, and his personal ratings exceeded that of Layton for the first time. However opponents frequently criticized Ignatieff's perceived political opportunism, particularly during the leaders debates when Layton criticized Ignatieff for having a poor attendance record for Commons votes saying [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>most</b> Canadians, if they don't show up for work, they don't get a promotion". Ignatieff failed to defend himself against these charges, and the debates were said to be a turning point for his party's campaign. Near the end of the campaign, a late surge in support for Layton and the NDP relegated Ignatieff and the Liberals to third in the polls.|$|E
2500|$|Vinnie {{was raised}} Roman Catholic in {{southern}} Philadelphia. Although his family practiced Catholicism, Vinnie felt {{disconnected from the}} religion.

As an adult, he gradually converted to Islam, and remains a Muslim to this day. In an interview with Jason Goss, Paz stated; [...] "Growing up yeah, I'm Italian and from Philly, so obviously my family is Roman Catholic. Religion and spirituality are a strange thing, ya <b>know?</b> <b>Most</b> people just grow up and accept the propaganda that their parents pushed on them. Christian families produce Christian kids, Jewish families produce Jewish kids, and so on. Not many people break that mold.

St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it.
