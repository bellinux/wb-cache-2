25|$|March Laumer {{was one of}} {{the first}} authors to {{continue}} the Oz series after the Famous Forty. His books were written with the permission of Contemporary Books, who owned Reilly & Lee, the original publisher. His canon includes everything he knew of that was set in the land of Oz, including Volkov's Russian Oz, the MGM movie, the Disney sequel, and many of Baum's own books that most <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not consider canonical.|$|E
25|$|In Hannah Montana: The Movie, Hannah reveals {{herself as}} Miley during {{a concert in}} her {{hometown}} of Crowley Corners, Tennessee, but her <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not want her to stop being Hannah, and so they promise to keep her secret. This event is actually mentioned in For (Give) a Little Bit during an argument between Miley and Jackson, meaning that the movie would fit {{right in the middle of}} season 3 as if it were a part of the season.|$|E
25|$|A broad {{consensus}} amongst fans is {{that the}} Star Trek franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s due to over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of TOS felt it also could be formulaic and repetitive). The release in May 2009 of Star Trek, a reboot involving characters from the original series and set in an alternate timeline, was developed with the partial hope to resurrect the franchise.|$|E

25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> {{this because they}} feel like they shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} Cambuur caused FC Groningen {{to be the}} nearest Eredivisie team and soon it became rivals with Heerenveen. Strikingly, both {{northern}} sides used to maintain more or less of a friendship in the past. Therefore, this Northern Derby rivalry is only based on geographical location. Because most Heerenveen fans have always considered Cambuur as main rivals, this derby {{is often referred to}} as a surrogate derby. However, Groningen <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> consider Heerenveen as main rivals, which created a situation in which there is hatred from Groningen towards Heerenveen, but not vice versa. Traditionally, the winner claims the title Pride of the North.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not care about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even remember that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and care more about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

25|$|According to the musicologists, the Lacanist {{psychoanalysis}} of the subculture {{indicate that}} the fascination to the singer's voice (the lack of understanding amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on international scale. The female fans (bangyaru) show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, as there several furi (movements) like tesensu (arm fan), gyakudai (reversed dive), hedoban (headbang), saku (spread hands in the air). The explicit fan fiction, and homoerotic acts on the stage by some musicians called fan sabisu (fan service; a sexual term borrowed from manga culture), {{are related to the}} Lacanian man's type of desire (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not desire the musician himself, but his desire, kind of cultural social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.|$|E
500|$|Earlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy {{attend an}} in-store {{appearance}} {{as part of}} the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, [...] "Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?" [...] This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency.|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|When Ward {{decided to}} try out for the {{football}} team as a sophomore, Michigan track fans worried that Ward would be injured. The Associated Press reported: “University of Michigan track <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> a lot of worrying these days because a Negro boy from Detroit insists on playing football. Willis Ward, they believe, will be the greatest track man ever to compete for the Maize and Blue—if he doesn’t get hurt. [...] … Ward is a good football player and loves the game[...] [...] [...] Well wishers even have told him about the advantages of competing only in track and staying away from the gridiron, but he is determined to play on the eleven, and he is good enough to make the grade.” [...] Michigan’s track coach, Chuck Hoyt, noted that “Ward is his own boss and football is his recreation.” ...|$|E
500|$|All of Stefan Hutchinson's Halloween {{comic books}} {{take place in}} the Halloween H20 timeline, which retconned Halloween 4–6 from continuity. Hutchinson {{comments}} that, while the retcon was unpopular with [...] "a lot of fans" [...] for ignoring previous movies, he preferred the [...] "simplicity of this storyline, over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last two films had created". However, he admits that one of the downsides of the H20 timeline is that <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after Halloween II. To remedy this, Hutchinson pitched Halloween: Sam as a way of paying tribute to the character. Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsiss Marcus Smith, Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during World War II. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in hospital, and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure.|$|E

500|$|The Jonas Brothers are parodied in [...] "The Ring" [...] {{and play}} a {{prominent}} role in the episode's plot. In a television column written before [...] "The Ring" [...] was broadcast, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested Parker and Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the thirteenth season debut as a means of improving the show's ratings; Comedy Central executives insisted Jonas Brothers <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not fit into South Parks demographic of males between the ages 18 and 49. The scenes with the Jonas Brothers using hoses to shoot foam into the faces of their female fans were inspired by actual scenes in Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. Matt Stone said some viewers found it so unusual they believed the writers made it up themselves. [...] The Walt Disney Company, the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured, and spoofed, in the episode; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people, he follows up most sentences with the character's trademark high-pitched [...] "Ha-ha!" [...] laugh, which in context comes off like a nervous tic.|$|E
500|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} Fullmetal Alchemists anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna. Mignogna {{has stated that}} {{performing}} Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar {{and that he did}} not plan to sound like her. Additionally, in the upcoming live-action of the series, Edward will be portrayed by Ryosuke Yamada. Yamada thinks his short starture might be work as an advantage due to one of Edward's most common characteristics is his low height. Studying Arakawa's manga, Yamada tried imitating Edward's other signature actions such the way he runs. A fan of the series, the actor expressed happiness with the role he was given. Nevertheless, in Anime Expo 2017 if anything from him looked [...] "weird" [...] which resulted in praise from the audience. During questions, Yamada said {{that one of the most}} difficult scenes about his acting is interacting with Alphonse as a result of the latter being CGI. As a result, in the shooting of some scenes the staff had a person in Alphonse's place [...] so that Yamada had a better way to act.|$|E

2500|$|In Japanese hip hop, a {{subculture}} of hip-hoppers {{subscribe to}} the burapan style, and {{are referred to as}} blackfacers. [...] The appearance of these blackfacers is evidence of the popularity of the hip-hop movement in Japan despite what is described as racist tendencies in the culture. Some Japanese fans of hip-hop find it embarrassing and ridiculous that blackface <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> this because they feel like they should not change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|During the Braves' rise to {{prominence}} in the early 1990s, their long-standing ethnic nickname came under much closer scrutiny, even being protested in Minneapolis when the Braves visited the Twins for Game 1 of the 1991 World Series. The team was especially criticized for selling plastic and foam tomahawks, encouraging the so-called tomahawk chop and the accompanying war cry emitted by the fans. The war cry and tomahawk chop are similar, if not identical, to what Florida State University <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> at their games. Initially, the war chant music was played by the Braves' organist, but in recent years, a recording of the FSU band has been used instead. [...] This tradition {{can be traced back}} to the arrival of former Seminole Deion Sanders, who also played for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons at the time (he would go on to play both sports simultaneously in San Francisco for one year).|$|E
2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw me coming. I had a big old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and <b>fans</b> <b>do</b> not believe that the crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E
