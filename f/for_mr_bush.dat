The first lady’s personal reply stated, “I firmly believe that we cannot tolerate discrimination against any individuals or groups in our country.

5000|$|In 2003, Parini {{along with}} Julia Alvarez and Galway Kinnell {{were invited to}} read their poetry at the White House. However, First Lady Laura Bush {{canceled}} the event after learning the poets were intending to protest against the Iraq War. Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman <b>for</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> said: “While <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> respects the right of all Americans to express their opinions, she, too, has opinions and believes {{it would be inappropriate}} to turn a literary event into a political forum.” Parini was disgusted by this decision: [...] "For poets to remain silent at a time of national crisis is unconscionable," [...] he said. Fellow poet Julia Alvarez added: [...] "Why be afraid of us, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush?</b> You're married to a scarier fellow." [...] Parini said it was naive for organizers to think he and other poets would check their politics at the door of an event sponsored by the first lady. In response to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush's</b> decision, Parini joined a group of poets that took part in a reading on February 16, 2003 at the Congregational Church in Manchester, Vermont, called [...] "A Poetry Reading in Honor of the Right to Protest as a Patriotic and Historical Tradition". The event was attended by over 700 people, and received national attention, bringing in over 50 reporters and warranting coverage by C-SPAN and 60 Minutes.|$|R

After selling the house in Tanglewood, the Bushes declared a room in The Houstonian Hotel in Houston as their official voting address. The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke <b>for</b> comedians. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, [...] "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan."

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (<b>MR)</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The semi-active bushing {{is intended to be}} used to isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs. This optimization technique is also applied to tune selected model parameters of existing two degree of freedom hydraulic bushings. This thesis also details the development of a <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> design retrofits an existing bushing with a pressure driven flow mode valve on the inertia track. A new efficient valve design is selected and developed for the application. The <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing</b> is designed, mathematically modeled, and numerically simulated. The simulation results show that the <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> tends to increase the low frequency dynamic stiffness magnitude while simultaneously decreasing the phase. The next stage of the project is fabrication and testing of the semi-active bushing. The performance of the manufactured <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> is tested on a base excitation apparatus. Varying the current input to the MR valve was found to have a small effect on the response of the suspended mass. The results are in agreement with the effects demonstrated by the dynamic stiffness numerical simulation...|$|R
