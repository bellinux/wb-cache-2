The system of three coupled differential equations comprising two equations of motions of plates and the wave equation, is solved exactly. Vibrations of plates are axisymmetric and time-harmonic with a single excitation frequency. The initial phase difference of excitations can be nonzero. Attenuation due to fluid loading and material damping is included. Kirchoff-Love and Kelvin-Voigt theories are applied.

For each, the anterior and posterior {{portions of the}} menisci were trimmed to provide relatively <b>flat</b> surfaces for <b>clamping</b> (Fig.  2). Menisci were clamped in a materials testing machine such that the axis of tension was perpendicular to the simulated tear (Fig.  2 c). After preloading to 5  N, the construct was cyclically loaded from 5 to 20  N for 500  cycles {{at a rate of}} 20  mm/min, pausing after 250  cycles to tighten the clamps. Thereafter, the construct was loaded to failure at the same rate. Residual elongation (indicative of gap formation) was determined after 1, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500  cycles. Ultimate load, ultimate elongation, and stiffness were determined from the load to failure.|$|R
40|$|A modal basis {{selection}} technique for a reduced-order nonlinear numerical simulation with application to two-dimensional structures {{is presented as}} a two-step procedure. A system identification analysis is first performed using proper orthogonal decomposition. Using these results, a set of load-invariant bases consisting of the normal modes is next selected. Two criteria for making the basis selection are offered; one using the modal assurance criterion and the other using the modal expansion theorem. The quality of the subsequent reduced-order analyses are examined through comparison with computationally intensive finite element nonlinear simulations in physical degrees-of-freedom. A <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> isotropic plate under a random acoustic loading is considered to demonstrate the procedure. It is found that the subject procedure enables formation of an accurate and computationally efficient reduced-order system applicable to a broad range of loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|Sliding clamps are ring-like multimeric {{proteins}} that encircle duplex DNA {{and serve as}} mobile DNA-bound platforms that are essential for efficient DNA replication and repair. Sliding clamps are placed on DNA by clamp loader complexes, in which the clamp-interacting elements are organized in a right-handed spiral assembly. To understand how the <b>flat,</b> ring-like <b>clamps</b> might interact with the spiral interaction surface of the clamp loader complex, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of sliding clamps (proliferating cell nuclear antigen from the budding yeast, humans, and an archaeal species) {{in which we have}} removed one of the three subunits so as to release the constraint of ring closure. The simulations reveal significant structural fluctuations corresponding to lateral opening and out-of-plane distortions of the clamp, which result principally from bending and twisting of the β-sheets that span the intermolecular interfaces, with smaller but similar contributions from β-sheets that span the intramolecular interfaces within each subunit. With the integrity of these β-sheets intact, the predominant fluctuations seen in the simulations are oscillations between lateral openings and right-handed spirals. The tendency for clamps to adopt a right-handed spiral conformation implies that once opened, the conformation of the clamp can easily match the spiraling of clamp loader subunits, a feature that is intrinsic to the recognition of DNA and subsequent hydrolysis of ATP by the clamp-bound clamp loader complex...|$|R

The described experiment is performed in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Göttingen (DNW-TWG) within a Mach number domain of 0. 7 < M∞ < 1. 2. This forced motion experiment is used for obtaining the aerodynamic response {{over a wide range}} of frequencies and amplitudes of the plate’s motion. Beside the measurement of the panel deformation by means of a stereo camera marker tracking system, the flow response over the panel is measured by high sensitive miniature pressure transducers.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a transparent WDM ring network design immune to accumulated power transients where simultaneous bidirectional operation is achieved {{on a single}} fiber. This allows cost effectiveness, flexible traffic re-routing, and network operation. We demonstrate that add/drop of 15 out of 16 channels gen- erate negligible (< 0. 15 dB) power excursion on the surviving channel. These results have been obtained by using new high-gain erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers in an innovative gain-clamped configuration that allows bidirectional operation. The glass-on-sil- icon waveguide optical amplifiers are able to achieve a <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> gain of 15 dB on full C-band with up to 0 -dBm input power. This is the highest output power ever reported for an erbium-doped waveguide amplifier.

40|$|Capacitive (condenser) MEMS {{microphones}} {{have been}} developed using various design and fabrication techniques to improve performance. Mechanical sensitivity of a condenser MEMS microphone can be increased by reducing the residual stress of the diaphragm using several design approaches including corrugated diaphragms, and in recent years, various spring type diaphragms. The electrical sensitivity of the condenser microphone {{is proportional to the}} deflection of the diaphragm, however, the parabolic deflection of the diaphragm, and thus its effective diaphragm area, has reduced the sensitivity of parallel plate type capacitor on a condenser MEMS microphone. This paper presents the numerical analysis on the effective diaphragm area of several condenser MEMS microphone designs of 1. 1 mm x 1. 1 mm square. The analysis shows that the effective area of a spring-supported diaphragm is about 20 % higher, and its capacitance value thus electrical sensitivity, is about 170 % higher than a fully <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm of an equal size. In addition, a flat deflection and higher effective diaphragm area of a spring-supported diaphragm can be achieved by carefully designed spring mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Capacitive {{microphones}} (condenser microphones) work on {{a principle}} of variable capacitance and voltage by the movement of its electrically charged diaphragm and back plate in response to sound pressure. There has been considerable research carried out to increase the sensing performance of microphones while reducing their size to cater for various modern applications such as mobile communication and hearing aid devices. This paper reviews the development and current performance of several condenser MEMS microphone designs, and introduces a microphone with spring supported diaphragm to further improve condenser microphone performance. The numerical analysis using Coventor FEM software shows that this new microphone design has a higher mechanical sensitivity compared to the existing edge <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm condenser MEMS microphone. The spring supported diaphragm is shown to have a flat frequency response up to 7 kHz and more stable under the variations of the diaphragm residual stress.

40|$|International audienceStatic {{instability}} of flexible structures forced by a parallel flow, a. k. a. divergence, {{has been the}} subject of a relatively small amount of studies, unlike flutter. In order to prepare future studies of the collective behaviour of several slender structures coupled by the fluid in axial flow, the canonical case of a <b>flat</b> flexible plate <b>clamped</b> at both ends is investigated numerically and experimentally. The onset of divergence is determined throughout a series of calculation of the fluid forces generated by a prescribed deformation of the plate. Using the Galerkin method, these fluid forces are expanded in the basis of the natural modes; they exactly balance the mechanical forces when the fluid velocity reaches the instability threshold. The instability velocity can be determined by an eigenvalue calculation involving the fluid force expansion and the modal stiffnesses of the plate. Comparisons are provided with 2 D analytical calculations and with an experiment performed with a 0. 3 m× 0. 03 m mylar plate at Reynolds numbers varying between 10 4 and 10 5. A fair agreement is observed between the 3 D potential calculation and the experiments, whereas the 2 D analytical solution underestimates the instability velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{weighted}} sum of spatial gradients (WSSG) control minimization parameter is developed {{for use in}} active structural acoustic control (ASAC) on a <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> rectangular plate. The WSSG minimization parameter is measured using four accelerometers grouped closely together on the test structure. In previous work, WSSG was developed on a simply supported flat rectangular plate and showed promise as a control metric. The displacement on the clamped plate has been modeled using an approximate analytical solution assuming shape functions corresponding to clamped-clamped beams. From the analytical formulation, weights, which {{were found to be}} the reciprocal of the wave number squared, have been derived to produce a uniform WSSG field across the plate. In active control simulations, this quantity has been shown to provide better global control of acoustic radiation than volume velocity. Analysis is presented which shows that comparable control, regardless of the sensor location, can be achieved using WSSG. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that WSSG works effectively in practice, with results similar to the simulations. The results show that minimization of WSSG can be used as an effective control objective on clamped rectangular plates to achieve attenuation of acoustic radiation...|$|R
40|$|Laser welding, unlike {{conventional}} arc or gas welding, can {{be effectively}} utilised to produce high quality, clean and tough welds in {{high carbon steel}}s. Results of welding high carbon steel are presented. The weld characteristics related to the fast cooling rate were critically evaluated and methods to reduce the rate of cooling were developed. The grain size produced in the fusion and narrow heat affected zones significantly affected the mechanical properties of the welded joint. Three lasers were used: Nd:YAG, CO 2 and a high power laser diode (HPDL). The investigations were carried out using a pulsed, 400 W, Nd:YAG laser, a CW, 1. 2 kW, CO 2 laser and a CW, 1. 4 kW high power diode laser. For the Nd:YAG laser, the dual beam delivery system was achieved with a step index fibre to produce in-line process heat-treatment during welding. The spatial and temporal temperature distribution was controlled in the weld region to generate the desired mechanical properties, without losing the benefits of this low distortion joining process. For the CO 2 laser system, a dual beam system was successfully designed, fabricated {{and the performance of}} the multiple beam system was evaluated. The welding quality was characterised by quantifying the effect of different laser parameters and welding geometry, including <b>flat,</b> angular, <b>clamped</b> and unclamped. The welding performance of the Nd-YAG laser was dependent on the welding speed, pulse width and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The effect of varying the laser parameters was quantified by measuring the hardness profiles, tensile strength, weld width, weld penetration and the rare of weld volume formation. Furthermore, microscopic examination was conducted at the welded joint. The quality of the welds was improved by increasing the pulse width and pulse repetition frequency (PRF), achieving a deeper penetration, wider weld width and greater weld volume formation rate and a tougher weld. At a slower welding speed, and for the higher pulse width and PRF, the hardness profiles were greatly reduced due to the greater spatial overlap of laser beam on the workpiece...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} experimental studies on different active vibration control (AVC) sys-tems concepts for <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> plates using Hinf-feedback controller. For a comparative performance evaluation of different control strategies {{in terms of}} global vibration reduction and system complexity, a generic set-up is used. The placement of piezoelectric actuators and different types of sensors (accelerometer, piezoelectric patch sensors) is performed with regard to controllability and observability criteria. In addition to the common multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) model from all actuators to all sensors a so called generalized plant with extended number of performance outputs is used to design a Hinf-controller. The extended number of performance outputs is generated by offline laser scanning vibrome-ter (LSV) measurements using a fine grid of LSV scan points. To evaluate the different control performances {{in comparison to the}} system complexity the number of transducers is varied. To identify the key trends more than 100 centralized and decentralized control-lers are studied experimentally and the global vibration reduction is quantified using LSV measurements. For systems with a higher complexity, it can be shown that the use of an extended generalized plant can significantly improve global vibration attenuation. Further, it can be observed that mixed sensor configurations lead to an improved broadband per-formance. The final evaluation is based on criteria such as controller performance, stabil-ity, modularity and system complexity...|$|R
40|$|The variable-pressure washer (VPW) is a {{proposed}} device {{that is so}} named because (1) it would play the role similar to that played by an ordinary washer, except that (2) the clamping pressure applied by it would vary with either circumferential or radial position. In a typical contemplated application, the radially varying clamping pressure {{would be used to}} obtain more nearly uniform compression on a pair of concentric seals (e. g., an O-ring or a gasket) in an assembly that experiences larger deformations normal to the sealing surface for locations around the outer diameter of the attachment flange when compared to locations around the inner diameter. The VPW (see figure) would include two interlocking channel rings pushed axially away from each other by compression spring-like components located at two or more radial positions. Each spring would have a different stiffness based on the radial location. Overlapping splits in each interlocking channel ring would allow for the non-uniform deformation in the rings. Each spring would be held in place by retaining cups attached to the inner flat surfaces of the channel rings. A plunger attached to one channel ring on the central axis would be captured in a plunger housing attached to the other channel ring: The capture of the plunger would hold the VPW together. When the VPW was <b>clamped</b> between two <b>flat</b> surfaces, the <b>clamping</b> force would be distributed unevenly across the face of the washer in the radial direction. The different stiffnesses of the springs would be chosen, in conjunction with other design parameters, to obtain a specified radial variation of clamping pressure {{in the presence of a}} specified clamping force...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with <b>clamps.</b> <b>Flat</b> and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
