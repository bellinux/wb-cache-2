5000|$|While ISTDP {{accepts the}} {{presence}} of faulty cognitions, the causality {{is thought to be}} reversed. The ISTDP therapist would posit that unconscious emotions lead to unconscious anxiety, which is managed by unconscious defences. These defences can certainly include hopeless, helpless, or self-deprecating cognitions. Rather than examining evidence for and against a thought like, [...] "I am unable to know my own true feelings," [...] an ISTDP therapist might say, [...] "If you adopt that position, which is essentially a position of helplessness, we will not get to the engine driving your difficulties.

40|$|Foot {{complications}} {{account for}} 20 % of all diabetes-related admissions in the North American population. They {{are a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes and of increasing health-care costs. Appropriate interventions can prevent diabetic foot ulcers and, thereby, reduce mortality and the rate of amputation. 1 Finding high-risk patients A history and physical examination can reveal much about a patient’s risk. Previous foot ulceration (relative risk [RR] 1. 6), prior lower extremity amputation (RR 2. 8), a diabetes history longer than 10 years (odds ratio [OR] 3. 0), a hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) > 9 % (OR 3. 2), impaired vision defined by an acuity < 20 / 40 (RR 1. 9), feet structural abnormalities (e. g., calluses and claw toes), increasing pressure points, diminished joint mobility, fissured skin, onychomycosis, tinea and inap-propriate shoes increase the risk. 2, 3 Screening for sensitive neuropathy helps target the group that is unaware of tissue injury because of lack of painful feedback. This {{is one of the major}} risk factors (RR 2. 2 to OR 15. 2) contributing to multiple repetitive injuries and postponing the discovery of the lesion. 2, 3 Loss of protective sensation can be easily assessed by monofilament and a tuning fork. Absent ankle and patellar reflexes can suggest a neuropathy. The 5. 07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament is made of nylon. It applies a 10 -g pressure when the filament bulges, and inability to perceive it is indicative of a clinically sig-nificant large-fibre neuropathy. The patient is asked if he feels the monofilament bulging on his foot in a “yes ” or “no ” fashion. It should be used in at least four spots (pulp of the great toe and the plantar surface of the first, third and fifth metatarsal heads).
