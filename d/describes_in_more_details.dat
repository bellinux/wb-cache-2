40|$|In {{order to}} apply the microseismic {{monitoring}} concept to study mechanical instabilities of rock masses, INERIS developed SYTMIS, a comprehensive Software package to design very low-cost but high performance, digital, monitoring and back-analysing Systems, based on Standard PC and/or Werkstation technologies. Designed to fulfil most field situations, SYTMIS also permit multiple moni-toring from an unique central site, whether äs a standalone Computer or local area network. The paper <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> how controlling seismic regime of rock masses is important, how SYTMIS works {{and some of its}} current applications. Any redistribution of Stresses (of mechanical, triermal, hydraulic origin) in a rock mass can result in irreversible deformations of the rock matrix and in anelastic readjustment of pre-existing discontinuities. It is possible to draw a distinction between quasi-static (or aseismic) deformations and dynamic deformations for which part of the elastic energy released by the fracture is propagated in the form o...|$|E
40|$|The {{plane wave}} imaging {{challenge}} (PICMUS) {{has been introduced}} {{for the first time}} to IUS in order to encourage participants to compete and share their knowledge in medical ultrasound plane wave imaging. To participate in this challenge, we have chosen the contrast enhanced delay and sum (CEDAS) post signal processing method. This technique have been used to improve B-mode image contrast to noise ratio (CNR) without effecting the image spatial resolution. With CEDAS the energy of every envelope signal is calculated, mapped, and clustered in order to identify the cyst and clutter location. CEDAS significantly reduces the clutter inside the cyst by attenuating it from envelope signals before the new B-Mode image is formed. This paper <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> the techniques and parameters we have been using for the challenge. Results obtained for CEDAS shows that it outperforms conventional DAS by 18. 33 % in experiment and 79. 24 % in simulation for CNR...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Proton beams {{in medical}} {{applications}} deal with relatively thick targets like the human head or trunk. Thus, the fidelity of proton computed tomography (pCT) simulations {{as a tool}} for proton therapy planning depends in the general case on the accuracy of results obtained for the proton interaction with thick absorbers. GEANT 4 simulations of proton energy spectra after passing thick absorbers do not agree well with existing experimental data, as showed previously. Moreover, the spectra simulated for the Bethe-Bloch domain showed an unexpected sensitivity to the choice of low-energy electromagnetic models during the code execution. These observations were done with the GEANT 4 version 8. 2 during our simulations for pCT. This work <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> the simulations of the proton passage through aluminum absorbers with varied thickness. The simulations were done by modifying only the geometry in the Hadrontherapy Example, and for all available choices of the Electromagnetic Physics Models. As the most probable reasons for these effects is some specific feature in the code, or some specific implicit parameters in the GEANT 4 manual, we continued our study with version 9. 2 of the code. Some improvements in comparison with our previous results were obtained. The simulations were performed considering further applications for pCT development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} these lectures is to give a {{pedagogical}} overview of cosmological pertur-bation theory, following the lectures given during the school. The topics treated are: I – The background II – Scalar/Vector/Tensor decomposition and the gauge issue III – The example of the tensor modes IV – Density fluctuations, transfer function and power spectrum V – Initial condition theory: quantum vacuum fluctuations Most of the material presented here is available in many well-written reviews or textbooks, {{so in order to}} avoid unnecessary heavy presentation as well as to make sure I forget nobody, I will only cite the review paper [1] as well as the book [2] from which most of the figures have been taken. Useful extra information and different perspectives can be also found in [3] (in particular the review articles by A. Linde on inflation, J. Martin on the quantum aspect of initial condition and their subsequent squeezed evolution and C. Ringeval on the numerical evolution of perturbations). Ref. [4] provides a personal vision of S. Weinberg with many original proofs to well-known results, and [5] <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> the relevant physics for calculating the quantities actually to be compared with the data. Finally, all numerical figures are taken from the Particle Data Group [6] whose latest update is always available on the linked site...|$|E
40|$|The Specialized Commission for Economy of Czech Foundrymen Society in the Czech Republic {{systematically}} {{follows a}} solution of particular phases of castings production from iron and non-ferrous metals already for eighth years. These separate studies are uniformly aimed at cost analysis of chosen phases of castings production. The analysis of cost heftiness and recommendations for concrete remedies for particular foundries are the results. The contribution is aimed at transparent description of topics of the PROJECTS I – VII. Further on it <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> the PROJECT VIII, especially the costs of preparation of moulding mixtures. The team solving this problem gathers the results of costs comparison of preparation of fifteen moulding mixtures in five Czech foundries in this project. The inquiry topics are bentonite moulding mixtures (unit, pattern, and heap), further on the self-setting mixtures (with waterglass and furane). The inquiry is closed with Cold-Box-Amine core mixture. The evaluation is aimed both at own cost comparison, and at prediction of moulding mixture costs resulting from knowledge of their structure. Further on it deals with the future growth of waste costs. Subsequently, the possibilities of costs specification concerning to power consumption are viewed. Very interesting results are described for studying the relations of costs of moulding mixtures and particular castings. Questions of determining the price of used return moulding mixture are remarkable too. The way to achieve another costs reduction is also the investigation of costs changeableness for mixing the mixtures. The work ends with summary suggestion of next progress...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} two VLSI Fuzzy chips designed to run at very high speed: 50 Mega Fuzzy Inference per Second (MFIPS) at least. The two projects differ {{in the number of}} inputs; one processes 2 - 4 seven bit inputs while the other one 8 - 16 seven bit inputs. The two chips have been designed for applications in High Energy Physics Experiments (HEPE) where the apparatus, called trigger device, needs to discriminate different nuclear events in few microseconds. So far most of the fuzzy logic applica-tions do not require high speed because not required by the industrial applications, therefore they have been done by implementing the fuzzy system on microprocessors, DSPs, or on commercial fuzzy chips which do not have very high speed performances like those necessary for HEPE. In the first phase of our research 1. 0 ym VLSI fuzzy chip [11, [2] prototype with four 7 bit inputs and one output running at 50 MFIPS was designed and constructed whose processing rate depends upon the number of rules of the fuzzy system. To further increase the speed we have faced the problem of processing, when possible, only the active fuzzy rules which are a few percent of the total ones. The research carried out on this prototype allowed us to extract some general conclu-sions:- for applications with no more than 4 inputs only the active rules are processed. Our design has a processing rate of 320 ns for 4 inputs, whichever is the fuzzy system. The process-ing rate is higher if less than 4 inputs are processed and reaches 100 ns for two inputs. - for applications which need 8 - 16 inputs an Active Rule Selector (ARS) has been designed to increase the process-ing speed which is 20 ns times the number of processed rules. The ARS is able to reject most of the non active rules. This paper starts with a concise description of the design of the first chip, already constructed and running, then <b>describes</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>details</b> the two new projects which are designed in 0. 7 ym CMOS technology with ES 2 foundry standard cells...|$|E
