25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of vandalism to curbside mailboxes, numerous vandal-resistant boxes made of composite plastic or <b>heavy-gauge</b> steel or aluminum plate have also entered the market. Some composite mailboxes made of resilient polymer plastics and mounted on ground spikes can resist severe impacts from baseball bats or even being {{run over by a}} vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} {{mailboxes}} with improved construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside mailboxes to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking mailboxes are generally constructed of <b>heavy-gauge</b> steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|E
2500|$|Lennon contributed vocals {{and guitar}} to [...] "Son Song", on the Soulfly album Primitive. [...] He {{can be heard}} in the final seconds of the song talking about how Soulfly guitarist/vocalist Max Cavalera's <b>heavy-gauge</b> strings hurt his fingertips.|$|E
2500|$|James Jamerson used La Bella <b>heavy-gauge</b> (.052–.110) flatwound strings {{which were}} never replaced, unless a string broke. He did not {{particularly}} {{take care of}} the instrument, as he stated: [...] "The gunk keeps the funk". The neck may have eventually warped, as many claimed it was impossible to play. While this made it more difficult to fret, Jamerson believed it improved the quality of the tone. Early in the '70s, a producer attempted to modernize James Jamerson's sound by asking the bassist to switch to brighter-sounding roundwound bass strings, but Jamerson politely declined.|$|E
2500|$|A {{class of}} heavier, more {{elongated}} pieces, probably produced in Africa, are often labelled by collectors as [...] "King" [...] or [...] "Queen" [...] manillas. Usually with flared ends {{and more often}} copper than brass, they show {{a wide range of}} faceting and design patterns. Plainer types were apparently bullion monies, but the fancier ones were owned by royalty and used as bride price and in a pre-funeral [...] "dying ceremony." [...] Unlike the smaller money-manillas, their range was not confined to west Africa. A distinctive brass type with four flat facets and slightly bulging square ends, ranging from about -, was produced by the Jonga of Zaire and called 'Onganda', or 'onglese', phonetic French for [...] "English.". Other types which are often called manillas include early twisted <b>heavy-gauge</b> wire pieces (with and without [...] "knots") of probable Calabar origin, and heavy, multi-coil copper pieces with bulging ends from Nigeria.|$|E
2500|$|Westland {{put forward}} their P.14, {{essentially}} {{an adaptation of}} Westland's Whirlwind fighter layout (and a more experimental twin, the P.13) to meet Air Ministry Specification F.4 of 1940 for a high altitude fighter. The most obvious feature was the enormous high aspect ratio wing, with a span on the production aircraft of [...] The compact but troublesome Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines of the Whirlwind were replaced by the more powerful two-stage Rolls Royce Merlin Mk.76/77. However, the most significant feature was a pressurised cockpit. The last item required {{the majority of the}} effort in designing what would become the Welkin. After extensive development a new cockpit was developed that was built out of <b>heavy-gauge</b> duraluminium bolted directly {{to the front of the}} main spar. The cockpit hood used an internal layer of thick perspex to hold the pressure, and an outer thin layer to form a smooth line. Heated air was blown between the two to keep the canopy clear of frost.|$|E
2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely to become tangled in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a top rail of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a mesh fence. [...] Mesh fencing needs to be <b>heavy-gauge</b> wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heavy-gauge</b> forming {{utilizes}} {{the same}} basic process as continuous thin-gauge sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many <b>heavy-gauge</b> forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret windows spurred the advance of <b>heavy-gauge</b> forming technology during World War II. <b>Heavy-gauge</b> parts are used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles, trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas, and shower enclosures, and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most thin-gauge thermoformed parts, <b>heavy-gauge</b> parts are often hand-worked after forming for trimming to final shape or for additional drilling, cutting, or finishing, depending on the product. <b>Heavy-gauge</b> products typically are of a [...] "permanent" [...] end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food item or product. <b>Heavy-gauge</b> thermoforming is typically used for production quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product development than competing plastic technologies like injection molding.|$|E
50|$|Use <b>heavy-gauge</b> {{conductors}} - Up to 19 gauge (approximately {{the gauge}} of pencil lead), which is costly and bulky. The <b>heavy-gauge</b> cables yielded far fewer pairs per cable {{and led to}} early congestion in cable routes, especially in bridge crossings and other areas of limited space.|$|E

50|$|The {{more than}} US$10 billion North American market has {{traditionally}} been ¾ thin gauge and ¼ heavy gauge. In 2003 there were about 150 thin-gauge thermoformers in North America. Sixty percent formed proprietary products. Thirty percent were custom formers and 10 percent were OEMs with in-house forming capability. There were nearly a dozen thin-gauge formers having annual sales of at least US$100 million. The largest had annual sales in excess of $1,000 million. There were about 250 <b>heavy-gauge</b> formers in North America. Nearly all were custom formers. Only two or three <b>heavy-gauge</b> formers had annual sales of more than $100 million. The largest had annual sales of about $140 million.2 Beaverton, Michigan, {{is known as the}} Plastic Thermoforming capital of the world fueled by the proximity of Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Michigan.|$|E

5000|$|Bending, {{especially}} wide bending, requires specialized finger strength. It is {{not uncommon}} for bending to be awkward or tiring for the hands. However, with proper practice, this subsides. String gauge also plays a big role; typically thicker strings are more difficult to bend. Notable guitarists who used very <b>heavy-gauge</b> strings while still producing musical bends include Stevie Ray Vaughan and Peter Green.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, modern house-construction {{techniques}} include light-frame construction (in {{areas with}} access to supplies of wood) and adobe or sometimes rammed-earth construction (in arid regions with scarce wood-resources). Some areas use brick almost exclusively, and quarried stone has long provided walling. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional building materials. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include insulating concrete forms (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with oriented strand board or fiber cement), and light-gauge steel framing and <b>heavy-gauge</b> steel framing.|$|E

5000|$|However, in {{the quiet}} of a studio, with {{sensitive}} recording equipment, this same buzz or hum would be unacceptable. As such, studio musicians use pro-grade guitar amplifiers that have ground lift switches, which can be toggled to remove ground loop hum. Similarly, whereas a working guitarist can use standard quality plastic case effect pedals and preamplifiers, session musicians typically use expensive boutique pedals which have <b>heavy-gauge</b> metal chassis (which prevent noise from nearby magnetic fields from affecting the sound), true bypass switching, studio-grade preamps, discrete Class-A signal paths, opto-couplers for noiseless switching, and isolated transformers to prevent buzz and hum.|$|E
50|$|The {{slide of}} the P220 series is a <b>heavy-gauge</b> sheet metal {{stamping}} with a welded-on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion is a machined insert attached to the slide {{by means of a}} roll pin visible from either side. The frame is of forged alloy with a hard-anodized coating. The SIG P220 series incorporates a hammer-drop lever {{to the rear of the}} trigger on the left side, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H before World War I. After chambering a round, the hammer will be cocked, so for safe carriage the hammer drop is actuated with the thumb, dropping the hammer in a safe manner.|$|E
50|$|This {{system is}} the first {{alternative}} culture system. Named SARGO™ Fin Farm System, the system was established in 1994 for intensive finfish production in both marine and freshwater environment. The system consists of six circular bags that are made of a <b>heavy-gauge</b> plastic installed in a steel frame floating at the surface and {{held in place by}} anchors {{in the same way as}} the net-pens. Electrical upwelling pumps continuously pump fresh seawater into the bags, and portable liquid oxygen tanks are used to provide oxygen to the cultured fish. A specially designed outlet is used to exit the waste-water and entered the marine environment untreated.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} IBC is the {{one-time}} use plastic composite IBC—a white/translucent plastic container (typically polyethylene) housed within a tubular galvanized iron cage that {{is attached to}} a pallet. IBCs can be made from many materials depending upon the needs of the shipper and the legal requirements that must be met. In addition to the plastic composite IBC, intermediate bulk containers are also made of fiberboard, wood, heavy gauge plastic, aluminum, carbon steel, and galvanized iron. <b>Heavy-gauge</b> plastic IBCs are made of reinforced plastic that requires no steel cage; they have a pallet molded into the bottom so the entire unit is a single piece.|$|E
