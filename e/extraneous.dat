5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an <b>extraneous</b> cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the <b>extraneous</b> cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|Yet more <b>extraneous</b> {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further {{ordinances}} in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all <b>extraneous</b> records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of <b>extraneous</b> tools.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks {{to give effect to}} the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much <b>extraneous</b> material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.|$|E
5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly <b>extraneous,</b> due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of the senators. Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of <b>extraneous</b> material in bills before the Senate. Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all <b>extraneous</b> weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain <b>extraneous</b> plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him to tell a broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided <b>extraneous</b> details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of stones increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number of stones had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the <b>extraneous</b> stones removed.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was <b>extraneous</b> to the agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on <b>extraneous</b> plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E
25|$|Using agents which {{mimic the}} {{cellular}} receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP antibodies, receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, <b>extraneous</b> receptor and synthetic receptor mimics.|$|E
25|$|For autoclaving, {{cleaning}} is critical. <b>Extraneous</b> biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can {{be achieved}} through physical scrubbing, sonication, ultrasound or pulsed air.|$|E
25|$|Dolpopa further {{expressed}} the viewpoint that the Buddha-nature transcends {{the chain of}} dependent origination. It is not empty of its own ultimately real essence, but only of <b>extraneous,</b> transitory and relative phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent to the Art Nouveau {{movement}} was the Wiener Moderne, during which some architects shunned {{the use of}} <b>extraneous</b> adornment. A key architect of this period was Adolf Loos, whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the Kärntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the Steiner House (1910).|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of Parliament has caused some controversy, as its work takes place {{not only in}} Strasbourg but also in Brussels and Luxembourg city. The split arrangement has caused financial, environmental and practical difficulties, with the Strasbourg location usually (though not universally) being cited as the <b>extraneous</b> location rather than Brussels.|$|E
25|$|By the rank–nullity theorem, {{a system}} of n vectors (matrix columns) in k linearly {{independent}} dimensions (the rank of the matrix {{is the number of}} fundamental dimensions) leaves a nullity, p, satisfying (p=n'k), where the nullity is the number of <b>extraneous</b> dimensions which may be chosen to be dimensionless.|$|E
25|$|The optimization, {{sometimes}} performed automatically by an optimizing compiler, is {{to select}} a method (algorithm) that is more computationally efficient, while retaining the same functionality. See algorithmic efficiency {{for a discussion of}} some of these techniques. However, a significant improvement in performance can often be achieved by removing <b>extraneous</b> functionality.|$|E
25|$|Thucydides omits {{discussion}} of the arts, literature or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he himself grew up. He saw himself as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable lengths to exclude what he deemed frivolous or <b>extraneous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution that judges, rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking <b>extraneous</b> matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to be mindful of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter lies not in which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded <b>extraneous</b> considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E
25|$|Hyperdontia is the {{development}} of <b>extraneous</b> teeth. It occurs in 13% of Caucasians and is more frequent in Asians. About 86% of these cases involve a single extra tooth in the mouth, most commonly found in the maxilla, where the incisors are located. Hyperdontia is believed to be associated with an excess of dental lamina.|$|E
25|$|The other {{required}} actor was Carl Herman Unthan (credited as Charles Unthan), a Prussian violinist who {{had been}} born without arms and learned to use his feet as hands. He {{played the role of}} Arthur Stoss, an armless virtuoso. Although his abilities were impressive, critics of Atlantis felt his appearance in the film was simply <b>extraneous</b> and non-integral to the story.|$|E
25|$|An automixer, or {{automatic}} microphone mixer, is a {{live sound}} mixing device that automatically reduces {{the strength of}} a microphone's audio signal when it is not being used. Automixers lower the hiss, rumble, reverberation and other <b>extraneous</b> noise that occur when several microphones operate simultaneously. They may also be used to mix sound from non-microphone signals such as playback devices.|$|E
25|$|This {{chapter is}} halakhic, dealing mainly with the Mishna. Other laws {{to do with}} idolatry {{discussed}} include sacrificing to an idol(51), food and vessels associated with idolatry(52), the exchange for an idol(54), {{and the status of}} a Gentile child in rendering idolatrous wine(57). <b>Extraneous</b> halakhic material includes the activities allowed and forbidden in the Sabbatical Year and cases of Rabbis making rulings for specific communities following their own opinion(59).|$|E
25|$|Another meta-study {{examined}} the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing {{effect on the}} patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or <b>extraneous</b> noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves {{as a sort of}} mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{instability}} phenomena are {{of particular}} concern for plasmid manufacture, DNA vaccination and gene therapy. Accessory regions pertaining to the plasmid backbone may engage {{in a wide range}} of structural instability phenomena. Well-known catalysts of genetic instability include direct, inverted and tandem repeats, which are conspicuous in many commercially available cloning and expression vectors. Therefore, the reduction or complete elimination of <b>extraneous</b> noncoding backbone sequences would pointedly reduce the propensity for such events to take place and consequently the overall plasmid's recombinogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|Other main {{controversy}} {{issues of}} Malaysian National Service include the selection system {{where the government}} computer database system picks up the trainees randomly without even knowing about their social status. Some cases include poor teenagers who need to work for their living and young mothers with newborn babies who were selected for the program, which are considered as inhumane. However, selected trainees with <b>extraneous</b> circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E
25|$|Forum trolls are users that {{repeatedly}} and deliberately breach the netiquette of an established online community, posting inflammatory, <b>extraneous,</b> or off-topic messages to bait or excite users into responding or {{to test the}} forum rules and policies, and with that the patience of the forum staff. Their provocative behavior may potentially start flame wars (see below) or other disturbances. Responding to a troll's provocations {{is commonly known as}} 'feeding the troll' and is generally discouraged, as it can encourage their disruptive behavior.|$|E
25|$|Mulland took Gustav Sohon with him, and in October 1862 {{made the}} {{difficult}} stagecoach journey from San Francisco to St. Louis again. Mullan found {{working at the}} Topographical Engineers difficult. He wanted to work from home, but was forced {{to work in an}} office. He hired staff to assist him without authorization, tried to include <b>extraneous</b> material in his report, and began pressing for new funds to rebuild part of the Mullan Road. An exasperated department ordered him to complete his report as swiftly as possible.|$|E
25|$|Investigations {{have been}} {{conducted}} into whether experts can objectively focus on feature information in fingerprints without being misled by <b>extraneous</b> information, such as context. Fingerprints that have previously been examined and assessed by latent print experts to make a positive identification of suspects have then been re-presented to those same experts in a new context which makes it likely {{that there will be}} no match. Within this new context, most of the fingerprint experts made different judgments, thus contradicting their own previous identification decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{biologic}} {{survival of}} autologous fat tissue {{depends upon the}} correct handling of the fat graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove <b>extraneous</b> blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat-tissue grafts to an adequately vascularized recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25–50 per cent of the fat graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Coercive {{citation}} is {{a practice}} {{in which an}} editor forces an author to add <b>extraneous</b> citations to an article before the journal will agree to publish it, in order to inflate the journal's impact factor. A survey published in 2012 indicates that coercive citation has been experienced by one in five researchers working in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines, and it {{is more common in}} business and in journals with a lower impact factor. However, cases of coercive citation have occasionally been reported for other scientific disciplines.|$|E
25|$|The same {{test for}} Wednesbury {{unreasonableness}} {{was referred to}} in other cases like Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2006), and City Developments Ltd. v. Chief Assessor (2008). However, the courts also considered whether the decision-makers had taken irrelevant factors into account in deciding whether the decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. This is not necessarily inconsistent with Wednesbury unreasonableness as Lord Greene said that taking <b>extraneous</b> factors into account could be seen an aspect of such unreasonableness.|$|E
25|$|An orthographic method called La Graphie de Conflans has {{achieved}} fairly wide acceptance among speakers residing in Bresse and Savoy. Since {{it was first}} proposed by the Groupe de Conflans of Albertville, France in 1983, it has appeared in many published works. This method perhaps most closely follows the International Phonetic Alphabet, omitting <b>extraneous</b> letters found in other historical and contemporary proposals. It features {{the use of a}} combining low line (underscore) as a diacritic to indicate a stressed vowel in the penult when it occurs, for example: toma, déssanta.|$|E
25|$|Judicial {{independence}} from the other branches of government allows the judiciary {{to act as a}} check and balance on the exercise of legislative and executive power, and thus enhances the separation of powers. The extent of judicial independence in Singapore can be examined by reference to the way judges are appointed, and, in particular, the independence of the judiciary of the State Courts. These two aspects relate specifically to the protection of the judiciary as an institution from <b>extraneous</b> influences, rather than the protection of individual members of the judiciary from external pressures.|$|E
