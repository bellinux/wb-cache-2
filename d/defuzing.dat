50|$|The use of {{mechanically}} operated {{systems to}} dismantle APM. The different technologies are available, {{as noted above}} are: Pull Apart, <b>Defuzing</b> and Depriming. In contrast to manual disassembly, mechanical disassembly has the advantages of high production rates, it is an efficient system of work and has low staff requirements. It is environmentally friendly for {{this stage of the}} demilitarisation cycle and the technology is readily available. A major disadvantage, however, is the requirement for high capital investment. This is further complicated by the need {{for a wide range of}} equipment necessary to cope with all pre-processing requirements.|$|E
5000|$|It is may be {{necessary}} to disassemble or breakdown anti-personnel mines prior to the destruction process. This is necessary because of limitations on the amount of contained explosive that can be incinerated, the anti-personnel mine design or the requirement for different components to have separate destruction methods. All of these methods require the movement of exposed bare explosive to the final destruction facility. Available technology includes: manual disassembly, mechanical disassembly (pull apart, <b>defuzing</b> and depriming), robotic disassembly, mechanical breakdown (bandsaw, guillotine, cracker mill, rock crusher, punch), cryofracture, hydro abrasive cutting, laser cutting, and microwave explosive melt-out. The following are brief descriptions of these techniques: ...|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, Plasticine {{was used}} by bomb {{disposal}} officer Major John P. Hudson R.E. {{as part of the}} <b>defuzing</b> process for the new German [...] "Type Y" [...] battery-powered bomb fuze. The [...] "Type Y" [...] fuze has an anti-disturbance device that had to be disabled before the fuze could be removed. Plasticine was used to build a dam around the head of the fuze to hold some liquid oxygen. The liquid oxygen cooled the battery down to a temperature at which it would no longer function; with the battery out of commission, the fuze could be removed safely. When an engine is being tuned for higher performance, different pistons and higher lift camshafts are often installed. This creates a risk that the valves might strike the piston, causing serious damage. Valve-to-piston clearance can be measured by placing a piece of Plasticine on top of a piston, replacing the cylinder head, and rotating the engine manually through a full cycle. When the cylinder head is removed, the valves will have made an impression in the Plasticine. The thickness of this impression is measured to give the valve to piston clearance.|$|E
50|$|At {{a rate of}} 500 bombs a {{week they}} were <b>defuzed</b> and {{individually}} coated in a waxy preservative to seal them. Seventy-two irreparable devices were neutralised on-site by being drained into individual pits filled with caustic soda crystals. Despite being given a preservative covering the bombs continued to suffer in the damp Welsh climate and in 1951 twenty-one 'Bellman' hangars were erected on the site to store the bombs. Finally in June 1954 {{it was decided to}} dispose of the entire stock because by then it was recognised that not only did the weapons have no military value but they had actually become a liability, which could only become worse as time passed.|$|R
50|$|Southall {{also wrote}} Softly Tread the Brave, {{describing}} the cold-blooded courage of Australian bomb-disposal officers, Hugh Syme and John Mould, {{serving in the}} Royal Australian Volunteer Naval Reserve, in England, when German bombers used parachutes to drop massive sea-mines on British cities. A sea-mine contained far more explosive than steel-plated bombs and could devastate a city block. To prevent an unexploded sea-mine from being <b>defuzed,</b> the mines were fitted with extremely complicated and sensitive fuzes. Some were light-sensitive, others were magnetically triggered, others were fitted with trembler-triggers. Southall later published {{a version of this}} story for younger readers under the title Seventeen Seconds â€” the time available to run in case the fuse of the mine was accidentally triggered while the bomb-disposers were trying to dismantle the fuse.|$|R
5000|$|Minority {{entrepreneurship}} {{entered the}} national agenda in 1927 when Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover set up a Division of Negro Affairs to provide advice, and disseminate information to both white and black businessman on how to reach the black consumer. Entrepreneurship {{was not on the}} New Deal agenda after 1933. However, when Washington turned to war preparation in 1940, the Division of Negro Affairs tried to help black business secure defense contracts. Black businesses were not oriented toward manufacturing in the first place, and generally were too small to secure any major contracts. President Eisenhower disbanded the agency in 1953. With the civil rights movement at full blast, Lyndon Johnson coupled black entrepreneurship with his war on poverty, setting up special program in the Small Business Administration, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and other agencies. This time there was money for loans designed to boost minority business ownership. Richard Nixon greatly expanded the program, setting up the Office of Minority Business Enterprise (OMBE) in the expectation that black entrepreneurs would help <b>defuze</b> racial tensions and possibly support his reelection [...]|$|R
