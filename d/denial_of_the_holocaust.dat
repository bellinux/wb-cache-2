25|$|Revisionist {{attempts}} to challenge or affirm claims of genocide are illegal in some countries. For example, several European countries ban the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> or the Armenian Genocide, while in Turkey {{referring to the}} mass killings of Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and Maronites as genocides may be prosecuted under Article 301.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, Argentina {{expelled}} Richard Williamson, an excommunicated Roman Catholic bishop. Williamson, {{who headed}} a seminary near Buenos Aires, {{was ordered to}} leave for 'concealing true activity' (he had entered the country as an employee of a non-governmental group, not a priest). The decision also cited his <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Muslim commentators, {{including}} Ehsan Ahrari of the Asia Times, have pointed at laws in Germany, France, Austria, and seven {{other countries in}} Europe which explicitly regard the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> as a crime, free speech considerations notwithstanding. They maintain that offensive imagery regarding the Jewish religion and the Jewish people is largely prohibited in the media in post-Holocaust Europe. The media in general practices self-restraint in this matter; therefore many Muslims say that {{a different set of}} standards applies for the Islamic faith.|$|E

25|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Porajmos and <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> was <b>the</b> extensive use <b>of</b> human subjects in medical experiments. <b>The</b> most notorious <b>of</b> these physicians was Dr. Josef Mengele, {{who worked in}} the Auschwitz concentration camp. His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change their eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes and various amputations and other brutal surgeries. <b>The</b> full extent <b>of</b> his work will never be known because <b>the</b> truckload <b>of</b> records he sent to Dr. Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was destroyed by von Verschuer. Mengele's own journals, consisting of some 3,300 pages, are likely never to be published, and they are suspected to contain <b>denials</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Subjects who survived Mengele's experiments were almost always killed and dissected shortly afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Denials</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> {{have been}} {{promoted}} by various Middle Eastern figures and media. Holocaust denial {{is sponsored by}} some Middle Eastern governments, including Iran and Syria. Prominent figures from the Middle East have rarely made publicized visits to Auschwitz—Israel's Arab community being the exception. In 2010, Hadash MK Mohammed Barakeh visited, following a previous visit of two other Arab-Israeli lawmakers, {{and a group of}} about 100 Arab-Israeli writers and clerics in 2003. Individuals from the Syrian government, the Palestinian Authority, and a number of Palestinian groups have all engaged in various aspects <b>of</b> Holocaust <b>denial.</b> In 2006 Robert Satloff writing in The Washington Post, reported that [...] "A respected Holocaust research institution recently reported that Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia all promote Holocaust denial and protect Holocaust deniers." [...] Hamas leaders have promoted Holocaust denial; Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi held that <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> never occurred, that Zionists were behind <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> Nazis, and that Zionists funded Nazism. A press release by Hamas in April 2000 decried [...] "the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis". In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> which it called [...] "a lie invented by the Zionists" [...] and referred to Holocaust education as a [...] "war crime". Nasser told a German newspaper in 1964 that [...] "no person, not even the most simple one, takes seriously <b>the</b> lie <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six million Jews that were murdered the Holocaust." ...|$|R

The Resolution urges every member nation of the UN to honor the memory of Holocaust victims, and encourages the development of educational programs about Holocaust history to help prevent future acts of genocide. It rejects any <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> as an event and condemns all manifestations of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief. International Holocaust Remembrance day is celebrated on 27 January, the day Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi camp.|$|E
25|$|The European Union's Executive Commission {{proposed}} a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed {{to agree on}} the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. An attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed European Union wide anti-racism laws on 29 January 2007.|$|E

On June 8, 2010, the newly elected Fidesz-dominated parliament changed <b>the</b> formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law to [...] "punish those, who deny the genocides committed by national socialist or communist systems, or deny other facts of deeds against humanity".

Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize genocide <b>denial.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> countries that ban Holocaust denial, some, such as Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Romania, were among <b>the</b> perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> and many <b>of</b> these also ban other elements associated with Nazism, such as <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> Nazi symbols.|$|R
5000|$|Some Afrocentric {{scholars}} {{prefer the}} term Maafa to African Holocaust, {{because they believe}} that indigenous African terminology more truly confers the events. The term Maafa may serve [...] "much the same cultural psychological purpose for Africans as <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> serves to name the culturally distinct Jewish experience of genocide under German Nazism." [...] Other arguments in favor of Maafa rather than African <b>Holocaust</b> emphasize that <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African people's humanity is an unparalleled centuries-long phenomenon: [...] "The Maafa is a continual, constant, complete, and total system of human negation and nullification." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{the author}} David Irving and his works {{have now become}} {{controversial}} for his <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> he is recognised as the historian who started the re-evaluation of Rommel. He was the first historian {{to gain access to}} a large number of Rommel's private letters, and his well-substantiated findings questioned Rommel's image as a [...] "chivalrous resistance fighter". This biography, however, has been criticized by other authors like Mitcham, Dowe and Hecht for misrepresentation of the subject or manipulation and misrepresentation of primary sources, and even invention of verbatim quotations with the aim of portraying Hitler in a better light.|$|E

5000|$|Negationism means <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> {{historical}} {{crimes against}} humanity. It {{is not a}} reinterpretation of known facts, but <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> known facts. <b>The</b> term negationism has gained currency as <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941-45, also known as <b>the</b> <b>holocaust</b> (Greek: complete burning) or the Shoah (Hebrew: disaster). Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history {{in such a way}} that <b>the</b> fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> is omitted.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2008, Prasquier led a CRIF {{delegation}} which {{met with}} Pope Benedict XVI in Paris during the Catholic pontiff’s visit to France. [...] "It {{was very important}} to us that that given his busy schedule he took the time out to meet with us on this special day, the Sabbath," [...] Prasquier was quoted as saying after the meeting. He also praised the pope for condemning anti-Semitism. However, a few months later, Prasquier criticized the Vatican for lifting <b>the</b> excommunication <b>of</b> Bishop Richard Williamson, who in an interview with Swedish television had question <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> “The <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shoah is not an opinion, but a crime,” Prasquier was quoted as saying.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> public memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish <b>Holocaust</b> at <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> Nazi Germans {{has become}} a {{reference}} point for debates about national identity and ethical responsibility {{on a global scale}} but nowhere more than in the Middle East. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> Israel bases its national identity narrative to a large extent on the Shoah, with the Yad Vashem museum and further Holocaust remembrance events and sites as symbolic “anchors” for the close linkage between <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Israel and <b>the</b> suffering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> victims as well as Jewish participation in the “struggle against the Nazi evil” (Declaration of Independence 1948). Reactions to this legitimising narrative of Israel’s national identity in the Arab and Palestinian public have ranged from <b>the</b> absolute <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish <b>Holocaust</b> to claims that since 1948, Palestinians have been suffering a new or, indeed, <b>the</b> only ‘true’ <b>Holocaust</b> in form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nakba and continuing occupation and victimization at <b>the</b> hand <b>of</b> Israel. Such claims have generated international sympathetic reactions (which even included West German terrorists’ attempts to justify anti-Jewish actions in Germany as proof of their solidarity with <b>the</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Palestinian holocaust”). In view of such far-ranging instrumentalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> as a topic of public discourse, it seems promising to investigate <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether Holocaust-memory has by now acquired <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> an identity-legitimizing metaphor scenario that is largely detached from its historical origins and is an obstacle to conflict resolution in Israeli-Palestinian relations...|$|R
2500|$|Pope Benedict XVI {{stated that}} he deplored all forms of {{antisemitism}} and that all Catholics must do the same. [...] The Pope expressed his [...] "unquestionable solidarity" [...] with the Jewish people, and stated his hope that [...] "the memory of the Shoah will induce humanity {{to reflect on the}} unpredictable power of hate when it conquers the heart of man", and [...] condemned the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Vatican officials stated that they had not been aware of Williamson's views prior to the lifting of the excommunication; as a result, in a July 2009 Vatican reorganization, the Pope tightened control and supervision over reconciliation efforts with SSPX.|$|E
