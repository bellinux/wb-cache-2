5|$|Elements {{took part}} in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok Atoll on 18 February 1944, code named Operation Catchpole. Because of the speed and success of the attack on Kwajalein, the attack was {{undertaken}} several months ahead of schedule. After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the atoll. The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> personally reviewed the division.|$|E

5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt.</b> Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|E

Truman stayed {{when he received}} the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and where Dwight D. Eisenhower heard the news of his first-ballot 1952 Republican presidential nomination. In all, guests have included at least 12 U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. During Kennedy's visit he was informed of the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command arrangements in the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March. Roosevelt proposed {{that the world would}} be divided into British and American areas of responsibility, with the United States having responsibility for the Pacific, where there would be an American supreme commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|With the 1950 mid-term {{elections}} drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning {{while the}} troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably George Elsey, came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party. In July 1944, President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. At this meeting, Roosevelt {{made the decision to}} attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war. It was a political triumph in an election year, refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe {{at the expense of the}} Pacific.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E

5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart. The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E
5|$|At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> {{signed the}} Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project {{to create a}} {{combined}} British, American and Canadian project. The British contribution to the Manhattan Project included assistance {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York, and the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. John Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Peierls, included scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton, and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a spy for the Soviet Union. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E

5|$|Born into a {{blue collar}} Irish-American family in upstate New York, LeHand studied {{secretarial}} science in high school, took {{a series of}} clerical jobs, and eventually began {{to work for the}} <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> vice presidential campaign in New York. Following the Democrats' defeat, FDR's wife Eleanor invited her to join the family at their home in Hyde Park, New York to clean up the campaign correspondence. FDR subsequently hired LeHand to work for him on Wall Street, where he was the partner in a law firm and also worked for a bonding company. After FDR was partially paralyzed in August 1921, LeHand became his daily companion and one of the main people to encourage him to return to politics, along with Eleanor and his political strategist, Louis McHenry Howe. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts and died after another stroke in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Judson Callaghan (July 26, 1890– November 13, 1942) was a United States Navy {{officer who}} {{received}} the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. In a career spanning just over 30 years, he served his country in two wars. He served on several ships during his first 20 years of service, including escort duties during World War I, and also filled some shore-based administrative roles. He later {{came to the attention}} of US President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> who appointed Callaghan as his Naval Aide in 1938. A few years later, he returned to command duties during the early stages of World War II. Callaghan was killed by an enemy shell on the bridge of his flagship, the , during a surface action against a larger Japanese force off Savo Island. The battle ended in a strategic victory for the Allied side.|$|E
5|$|George Washington sailed {{with her}} first load of troops 4 December 1917 and during the next 2 years made 18 round trip voyages {{in support of the}} American Expeditionary Forces. During this period she also made several special voyages. President Woodrow Wilson and the American representatives to the Paris Peace Conference sailed for Europe in George Washington 4 December 1918. On this {{crossing}} she was protected by , and was escorted into Brest, France, 13 December by ten battleships and twenty-eight destroyers in an impressive demonstration of American naval strength. After carrying 4000 soldiers back home to the U.S., George Washington carried Assistant Secretary of the Navy <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> and the Chinese and Mexican peace commissions to France in January 1919. On 24 February, she returned President Wilson to the United States. The President again embarked on board George Washington in March 1919; arriving France 13 March, and returned {{at the conclusion of the}} historic conference 8 July 1919.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the American {{television}} miniseries Eleanor and Franklin was released, starring Edward Herrmann as <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> and Jane Alexander as Eleanor Roosevelt; it {{was broadcast}} on ABC on January 11 and 12, 1976. It {{was based on}} Joseph P. Lash's biography from 1971 with the same title (and longer additional sub-title) based on their correspondence and recently opened archives. The film won numerous awards, including 11 Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and the Peabody Award. The director Daniel Petrie won a Primetime Emmy for Director of the Year – Special. In 1977 a sequel was released titled , with the same stars. It won 7 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Special of the Year. Daniel Petrie again won a Primetime Emmy for Director of the Year – Special for the second film. Both films were acclaimed and noted for historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, the Home Army Operational Command's Office of Information and Propaganda {{set up a}} Section for Jewish Affairs, {{directed}} by Henryk Woliński. This section collected data about {{the situation of the}} Jewish population, drafted reports, and sent information to London. It also centralized contacts between Polish and Jewish military organizations. The Home Army also supported the Relief Council for Jews in Poland (codenamed Żegota) as well as the formation of organizations of Jewish resistance under Nazi rule in Poland. One Home Army member, Witold Pilecki, was the only person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. The information that he gathered proved crucial in convincing the Western Allies about the fate of the Jewish population. In 1942 the Home Army sent Jan Karski on a secret mission to personally carry the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the mostly disbelieving Winston Churchill and <b>Franklin</b> <b>Roosevelt.</b> Before leaving, Karski visited the Warsaw Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp.|$|E
