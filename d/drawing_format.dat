50|$|Pro/DESKTOP (commonly {{referred}} to as Pro/D) formerly known as DesignWave, was a Computer-aided design (CAD) program from Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), that allowed users to design and model in 3D and create 2D drawings. It can transfer a 3D design into a 2D engineering <b>drawing</b> <b>format</b> and also create photo-realistic views using Album Views. It is part-compatible with Pro/ENGINEER, and uses the Granite kernel, but otherwise is a freestanding CAD system.|$|E

5000|$|This {{project began}} as drawn {{plans for a}} {{sculpture}} exhibited in 2003, but later became a unique, stand-alone series. The illustrations included in Local Ephemera [...] "depict various artifacts, both contemporary and historical, to reveal a world constantly in flux - the world of in between and inside out. It's a dynamic plane of shifting perception, but one framed within a technical <b>drawing</b> <b>format,</b> thus lending its structure while weaving themes often found in Ms. Awai's other work - of duality, location, and cultural reprocessing." [...] The artist describes this work as [...] "a parallel world" [...] where one can inspect [...] "in-between spaces, the slippage, around and beyond the boundaries." ...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{introduced}} 3 D games, game editors, {{along with}} gaming software offer {{great potential for}} delivering three-dimensional, collaborative virtual environments for online audiences. These capabilities have significant potential in architectural visualization. The University of Missouri-Columbiais Emerging Technology Group developed the Virtual Campus Project introducing the university campus to prospective students through the Internet. Fascinating quality, seamless real time rendering, and smooth navigation are enough to impress visitors. However, the developers had to use eye measures and guesses based on photos rather than architectural drawings for initial 3 D computer models. The absence of a precise scaling system as well as {{not being able to}} recognize a standard 3 D architectural <b>drawing</b> <b>format</b> in a virtual environment were the prime generators of this paper. One important goal for this paper is to suggest architects the potentials of using universal or exchangeable formats of 3 D models with accurate structure data to build virtual models. A second goal is to provide better understanding of potentials in 3 D game engines for virtual representation of architecture...|$|E
40|$|Computer aided design (CAD) is the {{earliest}} {{stage of the}} product cycle in a computerised manufacturing environment. CAD has the greatest role in helping to visualise the initial concept of a design with presenting the idea in a graphical view. The advanced of digital computer has eased the work of design drawing with generating the most complete design in 2 D (two dimensional) and 3 D (three dimensional) views. The generated drawing from CAD {{is not the end}} of the cycle of the product manufacturing process. The selected drawing will be sent to the manufacturing department for manufacturing process. The drawing created by CAD is just the description of geometrical features of the design component. This type of data cannot be used directly for the manufacturing process and normally intervention of human effort is needed to define all the manufacturing features from the component drawing again. As a result, a new system and database will be proposed. This system which has the ability to extract geometrical features from drawings and identify all the manufacturing features which is useful for manufacturing process. A neutral <b>drawing</b> <b>format</b> (ISO 10303 - 203) is as the input of the system. Then, a mechanism which consists of manufacturing feature extraction and feature recognition will be implemented and lastly, a new form of manufacturing feature-based data, ISO 10303 - 224 will be acquired for the subsequent manufacturing process...|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} {{the event of}} Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School, which has branches in over 120 cities worldwide. Dr Sketchy's combines the format of a life drawing class with burlesque performance, creating an event that focuses on both the performance {{and the creation of}} art by the attendees. Dr Sketchy's was begun in New York in 2005 by its creator Molly Crabapple, now an internationally recognized artist and popular alternative celebrity. I focus my study on the Christchurch branch of Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School, founded in June 2010 by Audrey Baldwin, a performance artist and Fine Arts graduate of the University of Canterbury. In my thesis I discuss the way Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School combines and compromises between the life <b>drawing</b> <b>format</b> and the burlesque performance, despite the differences and seeming incompatibilities between these two forms. I investigate Dr Sketchy's as a contemporary cultural performance which combines and to some degree inverts established genres of performance. I give a detailed history of burlesque performance and of life drawing within art education to allow a comprehensive comparison of the two traditions, particularly the way each has conceptualized the nude female body. I argue that the combination of the two forms allows Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School to transgress the traditional boundaries of each format and introduce influences that would otherwise endanger the status of life drawing and burlesque performance within their respective contexts. I also argue that the nude within Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School transgresses the traditional conception of the nude within life drawing by using burlesque as an acceptable reference for the transgressive elements of the show. The arguments put forward in this thesis are the product of extensive participant observation, interviews and literature reviews on the relevant art and performance traditions...|$|E
