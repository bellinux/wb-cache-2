50|$|Loncraine {{continued}} <b>directing</b> <b>pick-ups</b> into October; background {{scenes were}} shot in Washington, D.C. on locations including Pennsylvania Avenue and Constitution Avenue. During post-production, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd created {{two versions of}} the film with different aspect ratios; one has a 16:9 aspect for broadcast on HBO in the United States, and the other has a 1: 2.35 aspect for worldwide theatrical release. After filming the cinema version in the larger format, Ackroyd trimmed the picture for the television version using a pan and scan technique. The film's score was composed by Alexandre Desplat, who also worked on the music for The Queen. Final post-production mixing was carried out at Twickenham Film Studios, and was scheduled for completion in the second week of March 2010.|$|R

Because Hughes kept expanding {{what was to}} be re-shot, this phase of the production ended up taking almost seven weeks and costing over $1 million. Shooting wrapped in late November, but by March 1948, Hughes wanted more changes, and Ferrer came back to do re-shoots beginning on 27 March, with Hughes himself <b>directing</b> some <b>pick-up</b> scenes.|$|R
40|$|Former {{calculations}} {{showed that}} atomic N incident at energies {{of a few}} eV on N-covered Ag(1 1 1) forms N 2 molecules by the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism, i. e. by <b>direct</b> <b>pick-up</b> of adsorbates. Here, we calculate the azimuthal angle distributions and the rovibrational energies of those ER products. We observe a non-trivial angle dependence that may result in very low in-plane ER yield for some given incident azimuthal angles. We find {{that most of the}} energy released upon NN bond formation, about 7 eV, is stored in the rovibrational degrees of freedom independently of the incidence energy considered.

40|$|Mumps viruses show diverse {{cytopathic}} effects (CPEs) {{of infected}} cells and viral plaque formation (no CPE or no plaque formation in some cases) {{depending on the}} viral strain, highlighting the difficulty in mumps laboratory studies. In our previous study, a new sialidase substrate, 2 -(benzothiazol- 2 -yl) - 4 -bromophenyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-α-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosidonic acid (BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac), was developed for visualization of sialidase activity. BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac can easily and rapidly perform histochemical fluorescent visualization of influenza viruses and virus-infected cells without an antiviral antibody and cell fixation. In the present study, the potential utility of BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac for rapid detection of mumps virus was demonstrated. BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac could visualize dot-blotted mumps virus, virus-infected cells, and plaques (plaques should be called focuses due to staining of infected cells in this study), even if a CPE was not observed. Furthermore, virus cultivation was possible by <b>direct</b> <b>pick-up</b> from a fluorescent focus. In conventional methods, visible appearance of the CPE and focuses often requires more than 6 days after infection, but the new method with BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac clearly visualized infected cells after 2 days and focuses after 4 days. The BTP 3 -Neu 5 Ac assay is a precise, easy, and rapid assay for confirmation and titration of mumps virus...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) gradiometers based on the high temperature superconductor YBa sub 2 Cu sub 3 O sub 7 sub - subdelta (YBCO). A step-edge Josephson junction fabrication process was developed to produce sufficiently steep (> 60 deg) step-edges such that junctions exhibited RSJ-like current-voltage characteristics. The mean I sub C R sub N product of a sample of twenty step-edge junctions was 130 mu V. Step-edge dc SQUIDs with inductances between 67 pH and 114 pH were fabricated. Generally the SQUIDs had an intrinsic white flux noise in the 10 - 30 mu PHI sub 0 /sq root Hz range, with the best device, a 70 pH SQUID, exhibiting a white flux noise of 5 mu PHI sub 0 /sq root Hz. Different first-order SQUID gradiometer designs were fabricated from single layers of YBCO. Two single-layer gradiometer (SLG) designs were fabricated on 10 x 10 mm sup 2 substrates. The best balance and lowest gradient sensitivity measured for these devices were 1 / 300 and 308 fT/cm sq root Hz (at 1 kHz) respectively. The larger baseline and larger flux capture area of the pick-up loops in a large area SLG design, fabricated on 30 x 10 mm sup 2 substrates, resulted in significant improvements in the balance and gradient field sensitivity with 1 / 1000 and 50 fT/cm sq root Hz (at 1 kHz) measured respectively. To reduce the uniform field effective area of SLOs and therefore reduce the <b>direct</b> <b>pick-up</b> of environmental field noise when operated unshielded, a novel gradiometric SQUID (G-SQUID) device was developed. Fabricated from a single layer of YBCO, the G-SQUIDs with inductances of 67 pH, had small uniform field effective areas of approximately 2 mu m sup 2 - more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the uniform field effective areas of conventional narrow linewidth SQUIDs of similar inductance. Two designs of G-SQUID were fabricated on 10 x 10 mm sup 2 substrates. Due to their small effective areas, when cooled unshielded the...|$|R
