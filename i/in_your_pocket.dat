5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side}} of the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Baillie {{teamed up}} with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, {{alongside}} Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket,</b> about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren).

Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{coined the}} term 'Selsdon Man' {{to refer to the}} anti-interventionist {{policies}} of the Conservative leader Edward Heath, developed at a policy retreat held at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970. This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as Piltdown Man and Swanscombe Man, was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'. Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include [...] "the white heat of the [...] revolution", and [...] "a week is a long time in politics", meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly. In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: [...] "This {{does not mean that the}} pound here in Britain – <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> or purse – is worth any less...", and the phrase [...] "the pound in your pocket" [...] subsequently took on a life of its own.|$|E

Despite the stars' intense mutual dislike, and Fields's very real drinking problems, and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a box-office success, outgrossing Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940). Despite this, religious leaders condemned West as a negative role model, taking offense at lines such as [...] "Between two evils, I like to pick the one I haven't tried before," [...] and [...] "Is that a gun <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>pocket,</b> or are you just glad to see me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 1879, after {{previous}} {{efforts to}} restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty, Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with the Kid, who had witnessed {{the murder of a}} Lincoln County lawyer named Chapman. Wallace wanted the Kid to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but the Kid had killed others and wanted Wallace's protection from the outlaw gang and amnesty for his crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for the Kid to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> for all your misdeeds." [...] On March 20, the Kid agreed to testify against others involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for the Kid's arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. After the Kid testified in court on April 14, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. The Kid escaped from jail and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. The Kid was shot and killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
