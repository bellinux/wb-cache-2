5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue <b>factor</b> from damaged tissue. Tissue <b>factor</b> binds to circulating <b>factor</b> VIIa. The combination activates <b>factor</b> X to <b>factor</b> Xa and <b>factor</b> IX to <b>factor</b> IXa. <b>Factor</b> Xa (in the presence of <b>factor</b> V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (<b>factor</b> XIII, <b>factor</b> XI, <b>factor</b> V and <b>factor</b> VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by <b>factor</b> VIIa/tissue <b>factor),</b> antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, <b>factor</b> IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits <b>factor</b> Xa).|$|E

5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the <b>factor</b> V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. <b>Factor</b> V Leiden, which makes <b>factor</b> V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for <b>factor</b> V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk <b>factor.</b> Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand <b>factor</b> and <b>factor</b> VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E

5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} <b>factor</b> {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area.

Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed.
