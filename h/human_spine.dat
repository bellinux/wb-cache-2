25|$|The Hybrid III {{dummy for}} three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does not}} provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When {{using data from the}} real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the <b>human</b> <b>spine</b> upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like <b>human</b> <b>spine</b> curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliosis {{may be a}} {{byproduct}} of strong selection for bipedalism. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial. For instance, the <b>human</b> <b>spine</b> takes on an S-shaped curve with lumbar lordosis, which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk. Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged {{for a variety of}} different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages. It may increase viewing distance, which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans; it makes long distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting; and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses, trees, and bushes. Given the many benefits of bipedality which depends on a particularly formed spine, it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large {{role in the development of}} the spine as we see it today, in spite of the potential for [...] "scoliotic deviations". According to the fossil record, scoliosis may have been more prevalent among earlier hominids such as Australopithecus and Homo erectus, when bipedality was first emerging. Their fossils indicate that there may have been selection over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favoring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.|$|E

30|$|In {{cylindrical}} cages generally higher failure loads {{have been}} observed after axial compression tests in cadaveric <b>human</b> <b>spines</b> (Kandziora et al., 2002). For example, the failure load observed with a threaded, hollow, porous titanium BAK cage with a diameter of 15 [*]mm and a length of 24 [*]mm averaged 7.42 kN (Kandziora et al., 2002). However, several complications {{have been reported in}} the use of BAK cages, including risk for long-term subsidence and corrosive effects, that contribute to an increase in revision surgery (Beutler & Peppelman Jr., 2003). For this reason, interbody devices with large graft spaces for optimal bone fusion are warranted. Although vertical cages like the MAC cage have lower failure loads, they certainly provide larger graft spaces and might therefore prolong the survival of the PLIF construction. The MOSS vertebral body replacement spacer (“Harms mesh cage”) is another example of a vertical cage.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the anatomy of the lower cervical nerves and associated structures was undertaken, as these structures would most likely be affected by any stresses generated in the nerves of the brachial plexus during the upper limb tension test (ULTT).

The results {{support the hypothesis that}} the lower cervical nerves have a specialised anatomical arrangement which may protect them from forces generated in the upper limb and cervical spine by the ULTT. The fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves are securely attached to many structures as they emerge from the spinal cord to form the brachial plexus. Furthermore, the posterior longitudinal ligament anchors the nerve roots to the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs.

40|$|Background—The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD), {{characterized as a}} charged, hydrated soft tissue, is the largest avascular structure in the body. Mechanical loading to the disc results in electromechanical transduction phenomenon as well as altered transport properties. Electrical conductivity is a material property of tissue depending on ion concentrations and diffusivities, which are in turn functions of tissue composition and structure. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of mechanical loading on electrical behavior in human IVD tissues. We hypothesized that electrical conductivity in human IVD is strain-dependent, due to change in tissue composition caused by compression, and inhomogeneous, due to tissue structure and composition. We also hypothesized that conductivity in human annulus fibrosus (AF) is anisotropic, due to the layered structure of the tissue. Method of Approach—Three lumbar IVDs were harvested from three <b>human</b> <b>spines.</b> From each disc, four AF specimens were prepared in each of three principal directions (axial, circumferential, and radial), and four axial nucleus pulposus (NP) specimens were prepared.

Moreover, {{the results from the}} finite element model were used to calculate muscle forces that contribute in equilibrium of the head during rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes. To achieve this, a biomechanical model and the optimization algorithm were used to determine the relationship between required muscle forces and neck angle for the quasi-static condition. Finally, muscle forces were exerted on the finite element model to calculate internal forces. The results showed an excessive increase in internal loads by increasing the angle of rotation in all directions. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of higher cervical spine internal loads in non-neutral head postures, which can be a risk factor for neck pain and arthritis...|$|R
