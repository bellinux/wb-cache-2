500|$|PopMatters' David Gassman views Martin's {{selections}} as [...] "kind of twee and inconsequential" [...] and {{the four}} new songs on side one as [...] "fascinating", adding that [...] "The material's tossed-off origins give it a character unlike any other Beatles album." [...] While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Gassman writes: [...] "No matter <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> them, though, the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought {{to be part of}} any thinking Beatles fan's collection." [...] Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes: [...] "as a whole, Yellow Submarine is a delightful album, even if it's still a less-than-acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon", though he criticised the inclusion of Martin's score, which he felt should have been sold as a separate release.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{was a heavy}} smoker and drinker {{throughout}} his adult life, and suffered from heart disease. In 1961, aged 53, he {{suffered a heart attack}} and struggled to recuperate. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying [...] "I am sorry to trouble you chaps. I don't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." [...] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{was first}} to name Lopez {{as one of the}} many {{performers}} to take to the stage at the 2009 American Music Awards. which aired on November 22, 2009. She later confirmed this on a KIIS-FM interview with DJ SKEE, saying that the performance would debut her new single, [...] "Louboutins". The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage. Lopez performed in a boxing-like outfit and had a costume change halfway through the performance. The performance began in the ring and ended with Lopez walking through the audience. However the performance did not go as planned when the choreographed [...] "dramatic stunt of climbing up a human pyramid of semi-naked male dancers" [...] went wrong. [...] "She lost her balance after jumping off a dancer's back, and landed on her derriere." [...] In E! Online's [...] "Top Five Worst Concert Diggers", Lopez's fall was ranked at number five. However, according to The Daily Mail Natalie Trombetta, Lopez responded in a professional way, [...] "ever the professional, Jennifer quickly recovered her poise and carried on with the show." [...] Close friend and American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest, agreed calling it [...] "the greatest recovery ever!" [...] According to MTV, [...] "the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers". Becky Bain of 'Idolator' suggested that the tumble was more talked about than the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported {{that it was one of}} the most searched things on the internet. After the incident will.i.am praised Lopez for being a true entertainer. [...] "That shows she's a true entertainer and devoted, She came out of it and still rocked it. It doesn't matter how you fall– just <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up. She got up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions. According to Chomsky: [...] "he real work is being done by people who are not known, that's always been true in every popular movement in history...I don't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> that across in a film. Actually, come to think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don't see a lot of visual stuff, so I'm not the best commentator, but I thought Salt of the Earth really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time I thought {{that it was one of}} the really great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the team selection, controversy arose regarding the two teams selected. Michigan State QB Kirk Cousins, whose team failed {{to qualify for a}} BCS game because it did not finish in the top 14 of the BCS standings, criticized the potential selection of Michigan after his team's debilitating 42-39 loss [...] to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, [...] "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> punished for playing and someone else gets to sit on the couch and get what they want". Michigan State had defeated the University of Michigan 28-14 in East Lansing earlier that season. [...] Others criticized the selection of Virginia Tech, stating that both Kansas State and Boise State were more deserving of the bid and that the bowl committee had chosen a familiar team as opposed to a new one. [...] The bowl was considered the lowest-ranked match-up of two teams {{in the history of the}} BCS.|$|E
