5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} proposed regarding the development of modern human behavior, but in recent years the mosaic approach has been the most favored perspective in regards to the MSA, especially when taken in consideration with the archaeological evidence. Some scholars including Klein <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> for discontinuity, while others including McBrearty and Brooks <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that cognitive advances can be detected in the MSA and that the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250–300 ka.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Birrell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that {{immigration}} is creating social divisions and risks long-term national unity. Anthropologist and ethologist Frank Salter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that immigration}} is creating [...] "ethnic stratification" [...] in Australian society.|$|R
50|$|Bergmann {{has made}} two main {{contributions}} to economics. First, she <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that discrimination is a pervasive characteristic of labor markets.

50|$|Lax <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that Finland {{would be}} better off if it sought {{membership}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the time is now, and the option would not be available if the current peaceful situation changed.|$|R
5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made {{magnificent}} achievements {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime, or <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that there are serious problems with the official case.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{traditional}} gender associations, some scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the poem provides “both a language and models for critiquing sexual mores and social institutions” and encourages women {{to engage in}} scientific pursuits.|$|E
50|$|The detainees'defense <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not be}} used in Kuwaiti courts, because the detainees and interrogators hadn't signed them.Further, they <b>had</b> <b>argued,</b> the allegations the USA had directed at them weren't violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
5000|$|Schluter has founded two organisations which {{research}} relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. Schluter {{has also}} written several books on the subject. Schluter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that modern society takes very little account of relationships and <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the prevailing understanding of Capitalism in the West has [...] "built within it a framework of thinking that says {{the growth of the}} capital is more important than relationships." [...] He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that instead,society should focus on the importance of relationships whether that is in education or in companies.|$|R

5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav's deposition after the death of Asen. If he had been alive, Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E
5|$|Later scholars, however, <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Sycorax {{was saved}} from {{execution}} {{because she was}} pregnant. This was not uncommon, as many female criminals in Shakespeare's day got pregnant to avoid execution.|$|E
5|$|Lyn Wadley et al. <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} {{complexity}} of the skill needed to process the heat-treated compound glue (gum and red ochre) used to haft spears would seem to argue for continuity between modern human cognition and that of humans 70,000 BP at Sibudu Cave.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of this battle is not known. Whiteway <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that {{this place is}} identical with Amba Geshen, located far {{to the south of}} the Portuguese camp. More recently, however, C.F. Beckingham <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the battle took place in the eastern Semien Mountains near the left bank of the Tekezé River.|$|R
5|$|Scholars also {{debate the}} exact {{influence}} of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Durkheim's thought {{is a form}} of secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's home matches are {{presently}} {{covered by the}} pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list of sporting events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the digital switchover.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Buddhaghosa's writing evinces {{a strong}} but unacknowledged Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada {{thought in the}} wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition.|$|E
50|$|Wendy Davies <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} later medieval Welsh {{approach}} to property and estates was a Roman legacy, but {{this issue and}} others related to legacy are not yet resolved. For example, Leslie Alcock <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that that the approach to property and estates cannot pre-date the 6th century and is thus post-Roman.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Gavan McCormack <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> in Burchett's defence {{that his}} only {{dealings}} with Australian POWs were [...] "trivial incidents" [...] {{in which he}} [...] "helped" [...] them. With regard to other POWs, McCormack <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that their allegations were at variance with earlier statements which either explicitly cleared Burchett or blamed someone else.|$|R

5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid {{spent the}} three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He {{occasionally}} performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid {{may not have been}} allowed to return to Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Wilfrid was at Ripon.|$|E
