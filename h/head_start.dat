40|$|We {{analyze the}} revenue-enhancing {{potential}} of favoring specific contestants in complete information all-pay auctions and lottery contests with several heterogeneous contestants. Two instruments of favoritism are considered: <b>Head</b> <b>starts</b> that {{are added to}} the bids of specific contestants and multiplicative biases that give idiosyncratic weights to the bids. In the all-pay auction, <b>head</b> <b>starts</b> are more effective than biases while optimally combining both instruments even yields first-best revenue. In the lottery contest, <b>head</b> <b>starts</b> are less effective than biases and combining both instruments cannot further increase revenue. As all-pay auctions revenue-dominate lottery contests under optimal biases, we thus obtain an unambiguous revenue-ranking of all six combinations of contest formats and instruments...|$|R
