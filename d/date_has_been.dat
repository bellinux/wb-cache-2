5|$|Since the New Works Programme of the 1930s, London Transport and its successors {{have planned}} {{to extend the}} Bakerloo line south to a station on Camberwell Road.

Transport for London still intend to build this extension but no <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> set for this.|$|E

5|$|Opening of {{the first}} Federal Parliament, 9 May – The date 9 May is also {{sometimes}} suggested, the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in Melbourne in 1901, {{the date of the}} opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, and the date of the opening of the New Parliament House in 1988. The date has, at various times, found support from former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Tony Beddison, and Geoffrey Blainey. However, the <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> seen by some as being too closely connected with Victoria, and its location close to the start of winter has been described as an impediment.|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin is {{territorial}} {{during the}} breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2ha (0.6–3acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males {{have been seen}} to face one another 30cm to 1m (12–40in) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to <b>date</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> 36km (22mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower State Forest in northern Victoria.|$|E
