5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|In their ninth game, however, third-ranked Virginia Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. On a Thursday night game at home, the Hokies lost 277 to the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes. Normally, {{a loss to}} the division-rival Hurricanes would <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, as Miami had the tie-breaking head-to-head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games. But because Virginia Tech won {{the rest of its}} games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests, (Virginia Tech's only ACC loss was to Miami) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami.|$|E
5|$|During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Saratoga and Lexington {{were able}} to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two {{carriers}} were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San Diego to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.|$|E

5|$|On 31 March 1931, Lexington, {{which had}} been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, was ordered to aid {{survivors}} of an earthquake that devastated Managua, Nicaragua. By the following day, the ship {{was close enough to}} launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to Managua. During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Lexington and Saratoga were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932 without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Lexington was assigned to Black Fleet, defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and Saratoga. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward. Lexingtons aircraft were judged to have badly damaged two of Blue Fleet's battleships.|$|E

25|$|It {{would appear}} that the bow of Scorpion skidded upon impact with the globigerina ooze on the sea floor, digging a sizable trench. The sail had been dislodged, as the hull of the {{operations}} compartment upon which it perched disintegrated, and was lying on its port side. One of Scorpions running lights was in the open position, {{as if it had been}} on the surface at the time of the mishap, although it may have been left in the open position during the vessel's recent nighttime stop at Rota.

25|$|In March, United dropped {{points in}} the league with a 1–1 draw with Airdrie at Broomfield. The Scottish Cup quarter finals saw United go 1–0 up against Celtic at Parkhead through Owen Coyle, and with minutes {{remaining}} United looked to <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> out the holders. But {{just like in the}} finals of 1985 and 1988, two late goals for Celtic saw United lose out. United then went on a great run, scoring 17 goals in the next 4 matches, starting with another 2–0 win over Dundee at Tannadice, with McSwegan and Brewster scoring as Dundee's new signing Chic Charnley was sent off. Craig Brewster scored another hat-trick in a 6–0 win over Clydebank at Tannadice, before Andy McLaren scored in a 3–1 win over St Mirren at Love Street. At {{the end of the month}} Paddy Connolly was sold to Airdrie for £150,000 after over eight years at Tannadice.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini's {{entry into}} the war was at least {{bad news for the}} United Kingdom, as the Regia Marina would now oppose them in Mediterranean waters. Italian armies in Libya and East Africa could also {{potentially}} <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> British troops completely out of Egypt, having half a million men in Africa compared to the United Kingdom's fifty thousand. However, British troops took the initiative in Africa while Italy was still having trouble pacifying Ethiopia and General Wavell kept up a constantly moving front of raids on Italian positions that proved to be successful. On 14 June a successful surprise attack was made on Fort Capuzzo by the British, though it was not meant as a permanent gain as the British were using far more mobile tactics at the time. By mid-September, casualty listings indicate that Italy had lost 3,000 troops where the United Kingdom had only lost slightly over 490, despite Italy's land numbers and air superiority at the time.|$|E

25|$|While many fairies will confuse {{travelers}} on the path, {{the will}} o' the wisp {{can be avoided}} by not following it. Certain locations, known to be haunts of fairies, are to be avoided; C. S. Lewis reported hearing of a cottage more feared for its reported fairies than its reported ghost. In particular, digging in fairy hills was unwise. Paths that the fairies travel are also wise to avoid. Home-owners <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path, and cottages have been built with {{the front and back}} doors in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night. Locations such as fairy forts were left undisturbed; even cutting brush on fairy forts was reputed to be the death of those who performed the act. Fairy trees, such as thorn trees, were dangerous to chop down; one such tree was left alone in Scotland, though it prevented a road being widened for seventy years.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{dismissal}} in {{the morning}} session left Australia 331 for 7, and England should <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> {{over the last few}} wickets, but their inability to clean up the Australian tail cost them dearly. First Trevor Hohns with 21 off 38 balls, and then fast bowler Geoff Lawson with a career best of 74 off 94 balls provided the lower tail support Steve Waugh needed to go on with his innings. As the impetus of Waugh's innings grew, Lawson contented himself with spectating from the bowler's end, and playing defensively when he had to, although the 11 fours he struck during his innings testified to his ability to pick off the bad balls that were bowled to him. Lawson eventually fell to Emburey's off-spin for 74, but the damage had been done as he had supported Waugh to guide the Australian's past 500. With the fall of Terry Alderman's wicket, Australia ware all out for 528, a first innings lead of 242, with Steve Waugh once again not out on 152.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 2012, Hiddink agreed an 18-month deal {{to manage}} Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, his first {{permanent}} club post in six years.

In the quarter-finals of the same competition, having gone down to ten men 55 minutes into the second leg against Newcastle United, Anzhi came close to going through when Mbark Boussoufa's free kick hit the post before Papiss Cissé headed home the winner in the last seconds of the tie, meaning the Magpies won 1–0 on aggregate. This was the second time that the English side <b>have</b> <b>knocked</b> out a team managed by Hiddink in the competition, having beaten his PSV side 3–2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the 2003–04 season.

He finished 1991–92 with five goals in 24 games, and went on to help the [...] "Valiants" [...] to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. The club finished bottom of the Second Division, though the introduction of the Premier League meant that they were demoted to the Third Division, which was immediately re-branded as the Second Division. He scored six goals in 28 league games in 1992–93, and did not feature in the League Trophy final or the play-off final.
