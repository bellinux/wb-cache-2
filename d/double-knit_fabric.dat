5000|$|Double {{knit fabric}} became popular within 1970s fashion; in the 1988 Grammy Award-winning song [...] "Parents Just Don't Understand", Will Smith comically excoriates his mother for {{forcing him to}} wear outdated, 1970s-era [...] "double-knit {{reversible}} slacks". However, the <b>double-knit</b> <b>fabric</b> referred to is a machine-made double-thick construction with some similarities to handmade double knitting (durability, reversibility) {{but none of the}} unique colorwork and construction possibilities.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, {{the uniform}} was {{modified}} by a {{change to the}} double-knit synthetic fabric (the <b>double-knit</b> <b>fabric</b> first came into use by the Pittsburgh Pirates two years earlier). The jerseys were now pullover style instead of button down and the trousers had a built in elastic belt replacing the standard leather belt and belt loops. Slightly more trim, {{in the form of}} narrow red and white bands, was added to the V-neck line, the cuff of the short sleeve, and the elastic belt. This uniform style carried the Reds through three more World Series appearances, in 1972, 1975, and 1976, the last two ending in championships for Cincinnati.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{different}} structures of knit fabric on ultraviolet (UV) protection was studied. Different knit structures were investigated, which included single knits such as plain, pineapple, lacoste and other combinations of different knitting stitches of knit, tuck and miss as well as double-knit structure of half milano, full milano, half cardigan, full cardigan, 1 Ã— 1 rib and interlock. The results showed that <b>double-knit</b> <b>fabrics</b> provide better UV protection than single-knit fabrics. School of Desig...|$|R
40|$|The {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened development of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing and research on UV protection of apparel. Although various fabric parameters that affect ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researches, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approach in enhancing UV protection. There were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. The magnitude of transmission and scattering of UVR through a fabric is decided by fabric construction or knit structure, which is classified by geometrical arrangement of yarns and fibers of the fabric. This paper aimed at studying the influence of different knit structures upon the UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the knitted fabric constructions, namely the knit, tuck and miss stitches. The UPF and structural characteristics, including thickness, weight, stitch density and porosity of greige and bleached knitted fabrics with different knit structures, are compared by adopting factorial analysis of variance. The results show that fabrics with miss stitches possess a higher UPF than fabrics with tuck stitches. The <b>double-knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> have better UV protection than the single-knitted fabrics overall, but bleaching has different impacts on the UPF of single- and <b>double-knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The study reveals that fabric thickness or weight cannot be used solely in explaining the UV protective performance of knitted fabrics. However, fabric porosity {{can be a good}} indicator for UV protection when comparing fabrics with similar fabric weight and thickness but different structures or fiber contents.

50|$|Slip {{stitches}} may be {{used for}} an easier method of double knitting that requires only one yarn be handled at one time. As a concrete example, consider a two-color pattern with a multiple of four stitches (labeled ABCD) being knit on double-pointed circular needles. On the first row, using color 1, stitch A is knitted, stitch B is purled, stitch C is slipped wyib and stitch D is slipped wyif. The knitter then slides the stitches back to the beginning (recall that the needles are double-pointed). Then, using color 2, stitch A is slipped wyib, stitch B is slipped wyif, stitch C is knitted and stitch D is purled. The knitter then turns the work and repeats indefinitely. The knitted and slipped wyib stitches come forward, whereas the purled and wyif stitches recede, resulting in a (very warm!) double-knit scarf alternating in the two colors with beautiful drape. The knit and purl stitches produce the front and back fabrics, respectively, of the <b>double-knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> while the slipped stitches allow for the alternation of color.|$|R
5000|$|Provisional cast-on : Also {{known as}} an [...] "invisible cast-on," [...] since the waste yarn used can be pulled out later to allow the knitter to {{continue}} the knitting in the opposite direction. This cast-on is also the best method for <b>double-knit</b> <b>fabrics,</b> since the knitting has no boundary; the knitting is continuous {{from one side of}} the fabric to the other. Holding the ends of a waste yarn and the working yarn, make an overhand knot. Place a needle held in the left hand between the two yarns, with the knot below, the waste yarn held underneath and parallel to the needle out to the right, and the working yarn up and in front of the needle. Bring the working yarn down behind the needle and in front of the waste yarn; up behind the waste yarn and over-and-up then down in front of the needle; down behind the waste yarn; then up in front of the needle. Repeat for each two stitches. When desired number of stitches is reached, loosely fasten the waste yarn and work as usual with the working yarn. To take out the provisional cast-on, unfasten the end of the waste yarn and carefully pull it out, picking up the now loose loops on a needle and working from the opposite direction of previous work.|$|R
5000|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{unveiled}} new uniforms on November 18, {{returning to}} a variation of their vintage logo used from 1977 through 1996. The new logo {{is similar to the}} original used from 1977-96, with a few exceptions: a more prominent maple leaf, a sleeker-looking blue jay, serifed modern lettering on the team name, and a split-line blue circle enclosing the logo. The new uniforms are similarly based on the set used from 1989-96; a white home uniform with [...] "Blue Jays", a grey road uniform with [...] "Toronto", and a blue alternate uniform with [...] "Blue Jays". The team/city name is arched above the secondary logo of the blue jay with the maple leaf, sans the baseball, situated on the left side. The secondary logo is also placed in the blue cap. The uniforms use the breathable <b>double-knit</b> polyester <b>fabric,</b> claiming the previously lighter Climate Base fabric became too heavy, once players began to sweat.|$|R
