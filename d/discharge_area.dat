40|$|The Liulin karst {{system is}} typical of hydrogeological systems in northwestern China, {{with a group of}} springs as the {{dominant}} mechanism for regional groundwater discharge. To reveal the hydrochemical formation mechanism of the Liulin karst groundwater system, we studied the hydrogeochemical processes of karst groundwater in aquifers {{at the base of the}} hydrogeological investigation. Then starting from the chemical composition of karst groundwater together with the recharge-runoff - discharge process of groundwater systems, we analyzed the solutes origin and the dissolved mineral facies of the groundwater chemical composition. The results showed that the anionic and cationic compositions of karst water were different in recharge, runoff and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas,</b> with the main anions of HCO 3 - and SO 42 - in recharge areas, and HCO 3 - and Cl- in runoff and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as the main cationic for Ca 2 + and Na+, of which the molar concentrations of Ca 2 + was greater than Na+ in recharge areas and contrary to the runoff and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas.</b> Karst water was influenced by carbonate and evaporite dissolution while flowing through the aquifers, of which carbonate rock dissolution dominated in recharge areas, and evaporite rock dissolution increased to be the dominate lithology in runoff and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on analysis of water- rock interaction, the main dissolved mineral facies included dolomite, calcite, gypsum and halite.

2500|$|During {{most of the}} Paleozoic Era, {{what became}} the Ouachita Mountains was {{the bottom of a}} shallow sea, where several {{sedimentary}} layers were created.

[...] The thermal springs emerge from the plunging crest line of a large overturned anticline in the Zigzag Mountains of the Ouachita anticlinorium. The overturned anticline plunges toward the southwest into the Mazarn Basin. There are two recognized major thrust faults trending nearly parallel to fold axes that define the northern and southern limits of the thermal springs <b>discharge</b> <b>area.</b> The northern fault extends nearly parallel to Fountain Street northeastward about [...] onto the southeast flank of North Mountain, and dips about 26 degrees north.

40|$|Identifying {{groundwater}} recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> across catchments {{is critical for}} implementing effective strategies for salinity mitigation, surface-water and groundwater resource management, and ecosystem protection. In this study, a synergistic approach has been developed, which applies a combination of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to map {{groundwater recharge}} and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas.</b> This approach is applied to an unconfined basalt aquifer, in a salinity and drought prone region of southeastern Australia. The basalt aquifer covers 11, 500 km 2 in an agriculturally intensive region. A review of local hydrogeological processes allowed a series of surface and subsurface indicators of groundwater recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> to be established. Various remote sensing and GIS techniques were then used to map these surface indicators including: terrain analysis, monitoring of vegetation activity, and mapping of infiltration capacity. All regions where groundwater is not discharging to the surface were considered potential recharge areas. This approach, applied systematically across a catchment, provides a framework for mapping recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>areas.</b> A key component in assigning surface and subsurface indicators is the relevance to the dominant recharge and discharge processes occurring {{and the use of}} appropriate remote sensing and GIS techniques with the capacity to identify these processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTideless {{estuaries}} {{are very}} common on the western, {{southern and eastern}} Baltic coast. They {{play an important role}} as buffers and filters for the Baltic Proper. These functions can vary, depending on <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> and the situation in the estuaries themselves. Our knowledge of the estuaries varies widely, ranging from more or less simple descriptions to a fairly complete understanding of the processes taking place in their ecosystems. So far, only one preliminary comprehensive study has been performed for the whole area (Baltic Sea Environment Proceedings No. 40, HELCOM 1991). Three different <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> connected to tideless estuaries are compared in some detail:-the shallow polytrophic Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain, Germany-the shallow eutrophic Puck Bay, Poland-the deeper mesotrophic Gulf of Riga, Latvia.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the location}} of ground water <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> is a key aspect for the protection and (re) development of ground water-dependent wetlands. Ground water <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> can be simulated with MODFLOW using the DRAIN package by setting the drain level equal to the topography, while the conductance is mostly set to an arbitrary high value. However, conceptual and practical problems arise in the calculation of the ground water discharge by the DRAIN package as calculated water tables above the land surface, difficult parameterization of the conductance, and large water balance errors. To overcome these problems, a new SEEPAGE package for MODFLOW is proposed. The basic idea of this package is an adaptable constant head cell. It has a variable head, unless the ground water rises above the seepage level, in which case it has a constant head cell. The estimation of the ground water discharge location along a homogeneous, isotropic, linear sloping profile is used to verify the model and {{to compare it to}} the DRAIN solution. In an application to three basins in Belgium, it is shown that the SEEPAGE package can be used in combination with the DRAIN package in situations where an upper boundary for a free water table and additional resistance for drainage is required.

Despite this, trees still survive in many plantations established adjacent to saline <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> and land-holders often favour such locations, as they do not compete for arable land such as that occurs with plantings in recharge areas. Tree performance and salt accumulation were assessed in three experimental plantations established adjacent to saline <b>discharge</b> <b>areas</b> 20 1325 years ago. These were all in the 400 13600 mm rainfall zone of south-western Australia. Mean soil salinity, within 1 m of the surface, ranged from 220 to 630 mS m" 121, while permanent ground-waters occurred within 2 135 m of the surface and had electrical conductivities ranging from 175 to 4150 mS m" 121. The study confirmed the low growth rates expected for trees established over shallow, saline water tables in a relatively low rainfall environment, with estimated wood volumes in Eucalyptus cladocalyx, E. spathulata, E. sargentii, E. occidentalis and E. wandoo of between 0. 5 and 1. 5 m 3 ha" 121 yr" 121. Values of up to 3 m 3 ha" 121 yr" 121 were obtained on soils with low salinity (70 %) of several Eucalyptus species confirms that discharge plantations species can persist, despite increasing soil salinity.
