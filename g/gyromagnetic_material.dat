A general approach is taken that embraces both gyroelectric and <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> permitting the possibility of operating in either the low GHz, THz or the optical frequency regimes. The classical transverse Voigt configuration is adopted and a complete analysis of non-reciprocal surface wave dispersion is presented.

5000|$|Mu-negative media (MNG) {{display a}} {{positive}} εr [...] and negative µr. Gyrotropic or <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> exhibit this characteristic. A gyrotropic material {{is one that}} has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field, enabling a magneto-optic effect. A magneto-optic effect is a phenomenon in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through such a medium. In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not {{to be confused with the}} nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: M-type barium hexaferrite (BaM) is a {{promising}} <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> for self-biased microwave wave devices {{because of its}} large uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and low microwave loss in high frequency. Due to the limitation of growth conditions, {{it is difficult to}} deposit BaM films with enough thickness by PLD, MBE and Magnetron Sputtering for practical application. However, it is demonstrated in present experiment that large area polycrystalline BaM thick films (500 µm) with self-biasing (high remanence) and low microwave loss can be successfully fabricated by tape casting. X-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy results indicate that these BaM thick films have highly c-axis oriented crystallographic texture with hexagonal morphology. Magnetic hysteresis loops reveal that samples exhibit excellent properties with a saturate magnetization (4 πMs) of 3606 G, a high squareness ratio (Mr/Ms) of 0. 82. In addition, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurement shows that the FMR linewidth is as small as 431 Oe at 48 GHz. These parameters ensure these BaM thick films are potentially useful for self-biased microwave wave devices such as circulator, phase shifter and filter...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} topological phases in a 2 D {{photonic}} crystal with broken time (T) and parity (P) symmetries by performing calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures, Chern numbers, edge states and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes. Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular gyromagnetic rods. Here the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> breaks T symmetry while the triangular rods breaks P symmetry. Interestingly, {{we find that}} the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases with different gap Chern numbers (C_g) including |C_g| > 1 as well as quantum valley Hall (QVH) phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers (C_v), depending on the orientation of the triangular rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and vice versa, can be engineered by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal that the Dirac nodes at the K and K' valleys in the momentum space are produced and protected by the mirror symmetry (m_y) instead of the P symmetry, and they become gapped when either T or m_y symmetry is broken, resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively. Moreover, a high Chern number (C_g = - 2) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal points rather than pairs of Dirac points by breaking T symmetry. Our proposed photonic crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing topological phenomena which may be challenging to realize in electronic systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications in photonics such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of Calcium-Vanadium garnet loaded binary composites {{for use in}} the production of planar frequency agile microwave devices has been investigated. A WR 90 rectangular waveguide system using the transmission/reflection technique has been used to compare effective medium theory predicted permittivities and permeabilities for unmagnetised and transversely magnetised composites with actual measured composite properties. Use of the the Bruggeman effective medium theory with manufacturer supplied garnet permittivity and values of garnet permeability calculated using simple empirical models were demonstrated to be as accurate as predictions made using the measured properties of the composites' individual constituents. Errors in predicted material properties for unmagnetised and transversely magnetised samples relative to measured data were less than 5 % across almost half of the 8. 2 - 12. 4 GHz measurement band and within a worst-case error of 15 % across the whole band. A series of end-coupled linear microstrip resonators using garnet-loaded composite substrates has been fabricated and tested. Tunabilities in resonance of up to 3. 9 % at 9. 2 GHz have been demonstrated for DC magnetic bias fields applied transverse to the microwave magnetic field component. An entirely new and previously unpublished broadband microstrip technique for the measurement of the effective permittivity and permeability of bulk gyromagnetic and <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> loaded composite substrates subject to transverse DC magnetic bias fields is presented. This will have wide application in the design of frequency agile microwave integrated circuits.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new class of artificial materials, called metamaterials, can be harnessed to provide a wide range of electromagnetic properties beyond those of natural materials. These properties include positive and negative permeability and permittivity values, strong anisotropy, and the ability to construct spatially varying electromagnetic properties within the material. These unconventional electromagnetic materials have been used to demonstrate negative refraction and a cloaking structure among other interesting phenomena. To achieve their response, metamaterials employ periodic composite structures consisting of conductors and dielectrics that are shaped in various geometries which couple to incident electromagnetic waves. In this dissertation we investigate the introduction of fundamentally resonant materials into these geometrically resonant metamaterial structures. We are able to analytically characterize the unique hybridization that occurs. More specifically, we consider the integration of a resonant gyromagnetic materials into waveguide and bulk metamaterial structures. These hybrid structures are shown to provide a means of making strongly tunable metamaterial structures. In this dissertation we initially investigate the physical nature of metamaterial structures. In chapter 2, we consider the effect of geometrical disorder in the resonant elements of a split- ring resonator (SRR) metamaterial and the resulting bulk constitutive parameters. In chapter 3, we consider the potential for metamaterials to support novel surface modes. We experimentally demonstrate the excitation of magnetic surface polariton modes on a magnetic SRR metamaterial slab. In chapter 4, as a precursor to considering how to integrate naturally magnetic materials into metamaterial structures, we consider ferromagnetic materials and their integration into small dimensional microstrip structures. We develop simulation techniques that accurately reproduce experimental results for these analytically intractable structures. In chapter 5, we examine the metamaterial concept in the transmission line environment and consider the potential for constructing tunable metamaterial structures. Finally, in chapter 6, we theoretically and numerically consider a metamaterial with incorporated naturally resonant magnetic material and demonstrate that it exhibits a unique hybrid resonance. In chapter 7, we extend our analysis to a bulk hybrid metamaterial structure with integrated <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>material.</b> In general, these hybrid structures show potential for extending the electromagnetic properties of metamaterials. They also provide a means of magnifying and decoupling the electromagnetic properties of the integrated resonant magnetic material...|$|E
