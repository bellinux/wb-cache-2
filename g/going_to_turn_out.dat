500|$|In October 2013, it was {{revealed}} on-screen that Dylan {{is in fact the}} long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this story! Now, I don’t know how it’s all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out,</b> but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular. That’s all you need; good actors performing a good script, and our fabulous new directing team, and I love them all. I have not been this happy at work in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out.</b> After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{said that}} during this period, {{with all the}} changes on the team and with players {{returning}} from the war he had to [...] "re-establish myself as an NHLer." [...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> {{to be just a}} [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But didn't {{you come}} for a fortnight?' said his mother. 'And haven't you a month's holiday altogether? They are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you <b>out,</b> then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Anne Sophia. [...] "I {{understand}} {{that you have been}} buying our house away from over our heads, and are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> us <b>out</b> of house and home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't go to-day," [...] said Barry, sulkily. [...] "Who's {{to receive}} my rents? who'll send me my money?--besides--besides. Oh, come--that's nonsense. I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> in that style." ...|$|R
500|$|Prior to the film's opening five-day {{weekend in}} the United States and Canada, {{predictions}} for its weekend performance ranged from as low as $70million to as high as $125million. According to CinemaScore, Hancock was given a B+ grade by audiences. The film was shown in advance screenings on July1, 2008 in 3,680 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $6.8million. The film was widely released on July2, 2008, expanding to 3,965 theaters. At {{the conclusion of the}} five-day weekend, Hancock took top placement at the box office in the United States and Canada, grossing an estimated $103.8million. The film had the third-biggest opening 4th of July weekend after Transformers and Spider-Man2. Hancock was Will Smith's fifth film to open on a 4 July weekend and was his most successful opening to date. The film was also Smith's eighth film in a row to take top placement in the American and Canadian box office and the twelfth film in Smith's career to lead the box office. Hancock was also Peter Berg's strongest opening of his directing career to date. [...] Chad Hartigan, analyst for Exhibitor Relations, said about Smith's successful opening, [...] "Audiences don't care what critics say; they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> for anything he does." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Ben Kenney {{noted that}} the album's overall {{aesthetic}} revealed itself {{at the end of}} the process: [...] "We were trying to figure out an order for the songs. The sound, the overall feel, I don’t think anybody really had an idea that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> the way it did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he promised}} to give a man a penny, he'd give it. But if {{he promised to}} take away a pound, he'd take it, though it cost him years to get it. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> me <b>out</b> of my cottage, he says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Burnamy," [...] he {{answered}} from within. [...] "He's staying in this house. He {{let me know}} just as I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him <b>out</b> for the night. It's {{one of those little}} uncandors of his that throw suspicion on his honesty in great things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{happy you}} must be," [...] sighed Sara Ray romantically. [...] "It's {{just like that}} story in the Family Guide, where the missing earl comes home to his family just as the Countess and Lady Violetta are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> by the cruel heir." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This," [...] he said, [...] "is, I suppose, {{the kind}} of thing they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> at that wood-pulp mill. You have {{probably}} observed the thickness of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he can't fool with me, and {{it comes}} to this. I'm {{recorded}} owner of Gaspard's Trail; paid for it with my own check--Lane fixed that up. Now, what I {{want to ask you}} is, how's Lane <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> me <b>out</b> if I hold on to the place? Strikes me he can't do it." ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. They shouldnt {{happen to}} anybody, I suppose. But they do.

6000|$|... "You can't go off {{and live}} by yourself," [...] Caroline told her. [...] "It's all {{nonsense}} to talk of such a thing. We {{will give you a}} home, if Christopher is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you <b>out.</b> You were always a fool, Eunice, to pet and pamper him as you've done. This is the thanks you get for it--turned out like a dog for his fine wife's whim! I only wish your mother was alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'd known," [...] he said, regretfully, [...] "that {{this guy}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> a ruddy Englishman, I'd have taken a slap at him with m' stick and chanced it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you might}} say that, too. I believe she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> a decided character, after all. I never saw anybody so {{determined}} not to be married in a storage warehouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove," [...] he said, [...] "if you're playing, I'll play. I'll write {{a note to}} Adair now. But, I say"--he stopped--"I'm hanged if I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> {{and field}} before breakfast tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have her}} here, and then we'll {{take her to}} Glenbogie. Now when I say it I mean it. You go and fetch her, and if you don't I will. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have her <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> into the cold in that way." ...|$|R
40|$|Bounds are {{presented}} on {{the capacity of}} the block-memoryless phase-noise channel. The bounds capture the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion of capacity for SNR <b>going</b> <b>to</b> infinity and <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be tight for a large range of SNR values of practical interest. Through these bounds, the capacity dependency on the coherence time of the phase-noise process is determined...|$|R
2500|$|It can {{be asked}} whether Life is decidable: whether an {{algorithm}} exists, so that given an [...] "initial" [...] pattern and a [...] "later" [...] pattern, the algorithm can tell whether, {{starting with the}} initial pattern, the later pattern is ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> appear. This <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be impossible: no such algorithm exists. This {{is in fact a}} corollary of the halting problem.|$|R

2500|$|Stymied by his union, late in 1968 Miller {{organized}} other ill miners {{into the}} West Virginia Black Lung Association and won {{introduction of a}} black-lung bill in the West Virginia state legislature. [...] When Miller led other miners, their families and supporters on a march on the state capitol, Boyle sent legislators a telegram advising them (as Miller put it) [...] "not to worry about those so-and-so miners." [...] Boyle's behind-the-scenes lobbying {{had a significant effect}} at first. [...] When Miller met {{with the president of the}} state senate, the legislator [...] "told us raggedy miners to go back to the mines where we belonged. I got hot and told him, Mr. Jackson, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay here until the snow flies and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you <b>out</b> <b>to</b> pasture.' [...] " ...|$|R
60|$|The {{determination}} {{to be friendly}} made my brother offer {{to take her to}} us. She consented, but not very readily, and I am afraid we were needlessly cold and dry; but we were taken by surprise when my brother brought her into the sitting-room. It was not very easy to welcome the woman who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> us all <b>out,</b> and under such a stigma; and she--she could hardly be expected to look complacently at the interlopers who had her place, and the title she had a right to.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you <b>out,</b> Peters," [...] he said. [...] "I {{hear that}} you make some efforts to keep your house decently; the other two I shall send packing {{directly}} their terms are up. Whether you remain permanently must depend upon yourself. I will do up your house for you, and build a bar parlor alongside, where quiet men can sit and smoke their pipes and talk and take their beer in comfort, and have liberty to enjoy themselves {{as long as their}} enjoyment does not cause annoyance to other people or keep their wives and children in rags. I will do anything for you if I find the place well conducted; but I warn you that I will have no drunkenness. A man who, to my knowledge, gets drunk twice, will not get drunk a third time in this parish, and if you let men get drunk here it is your fault as much as theirs. Now we understand each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jon," [...] {{said his}} father to his mother, under the oak tree, [...] "is terrible. I'm afraid he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> a sailor, or {{something}} hopeless. Do you see any sign of his appreciating beauty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We began washing {{two days}} ago; to-morrow night we shall clean up. We all {{think it is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> pretty good, for we have seen gold in the sand several times as we have carried {{it up in the}} pails." ...|$|E

6000|$|As for the inn, yes, it {{was very}} bad. It had been quite good under the {{previous}} proprietors. But now--they shrugged their shoulders. The dirty-breast and the shawled girl were not the owners. They were merely conductors of the hotel: here a sarcastic curl of the lip. The owner {{was a man in}} the village--a young man. A week or two back, at Christmas time, there had been a roomful of men sitting drinking and roistering at this very table. When in had come the proprietor, mad-drunk, swinging a litre bottle round his head and yelling: [...] "Out! Out! Out, all of you! Out every one of you! I am proprietor here. And when I want to clear my house I clear my house. Every man obeys--who doesn't obey has his brains knocked out with this bottle. Out, out, I say--Out, everyone!" [...] And the men all cleared out.

Lotto also asks Row-the-Mighty a request — to defend the city. The group splits their separate ways because there are two portals. Il-Barn, Capri, Boromir, and Ah-Dol form one team, and Lotto, Yureka, Aradon, and Olios form the other. Basara eventually comes later behind the group of Roto, Yureka, Aradon, and Olios.
