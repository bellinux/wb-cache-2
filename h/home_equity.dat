25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth resources that are enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus <b>home</b> <b>equity,</b> and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus <b>home</b> <b>equity</b> is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} real exchange rate volatility on Australia’s <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias by employing, International Monetary Fund’s high quality dataset (2001 to 2006) on cross border equity investment. The paper finds some interesting trends in Australia’s <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias. The paper uses different control measures and also conducts generalised method of moments robustness tests, to examine the role of real exchange rate volatility in Australia’s <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias. The paper finds that real exchange rate volatility is a potential driver of Australia’s <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{financial integration}} and improving regulatory quality, we expect <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias to decline. Drawing on the supportive evidence for such trends in advanced economies, this paper investigates {{the links between}} financial integration and regulatory quality; and <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias in emerging Asia. To test the significance, a pooled OLS estimation was used. The results show that greater global and regional financial integration and better regulatory quality significantly lower <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias against global and regional stocks. The estimates also find that the lag value of the home bias significantly lowers <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias against global and regional equities; while bank assets and stock market capitalization increase the said bias against global and regional equities. Interestingly, volatility of foreign exchange rate significantly increases <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias against regional stocks, {{but not for the}} home bias against global stocks. The results suggest that if ongoing financial regulatory reforms lead to less information asymmetry and lower transaction and information costs in emerging Asia, <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias will continue to decline, allowing for greater portfolio diversification and more efficient allocation of capital resources...|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as <b>home</b> <b>equity</b> loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|E
25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. <b>Home</b> <b>equity</b> loans {{tend to be the}} most sensitive to changes in interest rates, while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Income {{and wealth}} {{statistics}} {{may serve as}} a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner. In 2005, approximately one and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding $157,000. Furthermore, only 2.6% of households held assets (excluding <b>home</b> <b>equity)</b> of more than one-million dollars. One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of American society are members of rich households. The richest 1% of the American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90%, or perhaps even more.|$|E
50|$|In eight joined appeals, homeowners had mortgaged their {{property}} to a bank. In all cases, the mortgage was securing a loan {{that was used}} by a husband for his business, while his wife had not directly benefited. The businesses had failed, and the wife had alleged {{that she had been}} under undue influence to sign the security agreement. Therefore, it was contended that the security should be void over her share of the <b>home's</b> <b>equity</b> and that because of this the house could not be repossessed.|$|R

25|$|The sizable {{decline in}} U.S. {{manufacturing}} jobs since 2000 has been blamed on various causes, such as trade with a rising Asia, offshoring of jobs with few restrictions to lower wage countries, innovation in global supply chains (e.g., containerization), and other technology improvements. The millions of construction jobs created during the housing bubble that peaked in 2006 helped mask {{some of this}} adverse employment impact initially. Further, households dramatically increased their debt burden from 2001-2007, extracting <b>home</b> <b>equity</b> for use in consumption. However, the housing bubble collapse in 2006-2008 contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting Great Recession, which resulted in households switching from adding debt to paying it down, a headwind to the economy for several years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with <b>home</b> <b>equity</b> who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} the {{importance}} of financial integration in explaining the observed decline of <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias in advanced economies. This paper tests this relationship {{in the context of}} Emerging Asia. Stock market ratios and the mean-variance approach are used to construct measures of <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias; while foreign direct investments and time-varying global betas are used to derive measures of financial integration. These measures provide evidence that <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias has declined in recent years and progress has been made toward greater financial integration in the region. Fixed-effects panel regression was used to determine whether the factors that contribute to the decline of the bias in advanced economies – including financial integration – are relevant for Emerging Asia. Results show that a higher initial level of <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias and a greater financial integration lower the bias. As in advanced economies, better quality of institutions and larger bank assets generally lower <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias, although insignificantly. However, unlike in advanced economies, country-specific risks are important in explaining the decline of the bias in Emerging Asia...|$|R

Optimal portfolios are internationally diversified while positive correlation between domestic stock market returns and permanent labor income shocks can generate a complete portfolio specialization in foreign stocks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{tentatively}} and formally the differences between bond and <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias and foreign bias based on one large scale dataset including developed and emerging markets for the period 2001 to 2010. We set the stage by tentatively and formally linking the diversion of bond and <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias in OECD countries to the increasing public debt issues under the form of government bonds i. e. the supply-driven argument. Unlike Fidora et al. (2007) we do not find that exchange rate volatility has {{a greater impact on}} bond home bias than on <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> bias. We find, instead, that exchange rate volatility has a greater impact on bond foreign bias than on equity foreign bias. We also show that the level of financial development is more important for attracting foreign bond investors than foreign equity investors; and country and corporate governance practices matter more for international equity portfolios than for international bond portfolios. Besides variables being significantly more, less or incompatibly important for bond versus <b>equity</b> <b>home</b> and foreign bias, we also find variables exclusively significant for bonds.
