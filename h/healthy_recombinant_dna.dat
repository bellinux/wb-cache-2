50|$|Scientists {{associated}} with the initial development of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 Asilomar Conference on <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA,</b> these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules and <b>recombinant</b> proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA,</b> particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns {{are discussed in the}} articles on genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food controversies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> is a {{technique}} of major importance in basic biomedical research and, increasingly, in industrial applications. Although the risks of this research remain hypothetical, scientists {{working in the field}} have spearheaded discussions of safety. The original National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> Research were issued in June 1976. They assigned each type of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> experiment a specific level of "physical containment" and of "biological containment. " Responsibility for overseeing the application of the guidelines belongs to the NIH <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> Advisory Committee (RAC) [...] composed of scientists and laymen, including non-voting representatives from many Federal agencies [...] and local institutional biosafety committees at each university where <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research is conducted. The NIH guidelines were subsequently adopted by other Federal agencies, but congressional proposals aimed at extending the guidelines to private industry did not result in national legislation. Some States and localities regulate <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research, however, and many private companies have voluntarily submitted information on their <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> work for RAC and NIH approval. The NIH guidelines underwent a major revision in December 1978 and have been revised approximately every 3 months since then. NIH supports experiments to assess <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> risks and publishes and updates a plan for a risk assessment program...|$|R

50|$|The idea of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Peter Lobban, {{a graduate student}} of Prof. Dale Kaiser in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford University Medical School. The first publications describing the successful production and intracellular replication of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> appeared in 1972 and 1973. Stanford University applied for a US patent on <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> in 1974, listing the inventors as Stanley N. Cohen and Herbert W. Boyer; this patent was awarded in 1980. The first licensed drug generated using <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> technology was human insulin, developed by Genentech and Licensed by Eli Lilly and Company.|$|R

After the production of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> derived mouse and human IFN-y, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> derived rat IFN-y became available. With this species-specific cytokine it has become possible to study biological effects of IFN-y in rats. Compared to the mouse model, the rat model is more suitable to study activities of IFN-y in tumor and organ transplantation experiments, since these experiments are technically far less demanding in rats. In this thesis multiple biological effects of rRIFN-y are studied in transplantation and tumor experiments in rats...|$|R

50|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> are DNA biomolecules {{that contain}} genetic {{sequences}} {{that are not}} native to the organism’s genome. Using recombinant techniques, {{it is possible to}} insert, delete, or alter a DNA sequence precisely without depending on the location of restriction sites. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> is used {{for a wide range of}} applications.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{conventional}} molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes {{in the test}} tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector <b>DNA</b> to generate <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, laboratory strain of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO). This process {{takes advantage of the}} fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting bacterial population, and the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule, are commonly referred to as [...] "clones". Strictly speaking, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them. The idea arose that different DNA sequences could be inserted into a plasmid and that these foreign sequences would be carried into bacteria and digested as part of the plasmid. That is, these plasmids could serve as cloning vectors to carry genes.|$|R
