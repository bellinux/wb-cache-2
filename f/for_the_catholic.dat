Money raised at this these two events is donated to the parish to help aid in the costs of parish projects.|$|E
5|$|It took Henry IV {{several years}} to retake Paris. By the time he succeeded in 1594, {{the area around the}} Bastille formed the main stronghold <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> League and their foreign allies, {{including}} Spanish and Flemish troops. The Bastille itself was controlled by a League captain called du Bourg. Henry entered Paris early on the morning of 23 March, through the Porte-Neuve rather than the Saint-Antoine and seized the capital, including the Arsenal complex that neighboured the Bastille. The Bastille was now an isolated League stronghold, with the remaining members of the League and their allies clustering around it for safety. After several days of tension, an agreement was finally reached for this rump element to leave safely, and on 27 March du Bourg surrendered the Bastille and left the city himself.|$|E

Katowice's Bishop Adamski was deposed as apostolic administrator <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> parishes in Zaolzie and on 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, nuncio to Germany, returned them to their original archdioceses of Breslau or Olomouc, respectively, with effect of 1 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Brazil, PedroII was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised {{a great deal of}} control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.|$|E
5|$|Article {{five of the}} Constitution {{declared}} Catholicism to be {{the state}} religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of {{which led to a}} general loss of respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church. During PedroII's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance on education and support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased. Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines. This resulted in the Religious Question, a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government, since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs.|$|E
