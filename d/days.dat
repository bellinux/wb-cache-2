5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} in a couple of <b>days</b> by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four <b>days</b> after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten <b>days,</b> but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen <b>days</b> and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten <b>days</b> in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 <b>days</b> in 10%.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these <b>days,</b> the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather <b>days</b> were high risk <b>days.</b> Such <b>days</b> are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk <b>days).</b> High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six <b>days</b> of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen <b>days</b> (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 <b>days).</b> Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty <b>days.</b> Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{students}} travel to school using the nation's bus network, which is free for state school students to use. Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm.

5|$|A {{spin-off}} titled Summer <b>Days,</b> {{was released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer <b>Days</b> was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross <b>Days</b> {{was released on}} March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School <b>Days,</b> Cross <b>Days</b> follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny <b>Days</b> on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the <b>Days</b> series and Radish Vacation series. A third spin-off, Island <b>Days,</b> was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E

On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing Hitch ($177.6million). The film earned $158.5million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by The Matrix Reloaded ($134.3million), and joining Spider-Man, The Matrix Reloaded and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one the only films to make $100million in three <b>days.</b> In eight <b>days,</b> it reached the $200million mark (a record tied with Spider-Man 2) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300million (surpassing the record of 18 <b>days</b> of Shrek 2). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after Shrek 2 and Spider-Man) to reach $350 million.|$|E

5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 <b>days</b> old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 <b>days,</b> followed by primaries at 24–27 <b>days,</b> tail feathers at 30–35 <b>days</b> and are fully feathered by 55 <b>days.</b> They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those <b>days.</b> Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 <b>days.</b> After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 <b>days.</b>|$|E
