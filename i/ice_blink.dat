50|$|In 2004, Chiang co-founded <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> Studios {{and worked}} for Zemeckis on Beowulf. <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> closed in 2007, {{becoming}} {{the core of the}} facility for ImageMovers Digital, a pioneering performance capture animation studio.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blink</b> is a {{white light}} seen near the horizon, {{especially}} {{on the underside of}} low clouds, resulting from reflection of light off a field of ice immediately beyond. The <b>ice</b> <b>blink</b> was used by both the Inuit and explorers looking for the Northwest Passage to help them navigate safely.|$|E
50|$|In the winter, a {{lone wolf}} named Wind Voice joins the pack, and the wolves return to Raw Bones's old {{territory}} {{to find it}} vacant of wolves (<b>Ice</b> <b>Blink′s</b> rabid infection wiped them out). The Avaliks expand their territory so that it includes this land, to Raw Bones′s obvious delight.|$|R
50|$|As March comes around, both Aaka and <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> go into heat. Aaka and Kapu mate, but <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink,</b> {{who feels}} {{she is not}} ready for pups yet, allows Raw Bones to court her. They travel to his old {{territory}} near the Colville River, which by now has {{been taken over by}} a pack from the mountains. The wolves ambush the two, and it is here that <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> succumbs to rabies and bites the alpha female Cloud Berry, passing the disease on to her. She dies hours later, and Raw Bones returns to the Avaliks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>Blink,</b> the StrangerWith Julie and {{her family}} raising them, No Growl and Tiny Whimper—renamed Nutik (“jumper”) and Uqaq (“to talk”)—become strong and healthy. Kapu and his pack remain close to Julie′s home, intent on {{retrieving}} the pups when the time come. Complications arise when Silver begins to grow weak, a rival pack move onto the Avalik territory, {{and the arrival of}} a strange wolf known as <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink.</b>|$|E
50|$|Philip Smith Mountain Pack: Led by Sedge Ears and Alder Whisper. <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> {{attempted}} {{to join this}} pack in part two, but was declined.|$|E
50|$|Canadian Pack: The pack <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> hails from. She had led {{the pack}} with her mate Bear Scratcher before the rabies killed him, two of their sons, and the {{remaining}} pack members.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> was a lecture, {{exhibition}} and book commissioned by The Arts Catalyst that collected together {{the body of}} work made during a two-month journey to Antarctica in 2004/2005, traveling with the British Antarctic Survey on their research vessel, [...] This tied in with Faithfull’s Antarctica Dispatches—the initial ‘live’ drawing project undertaken during the two-month journey. Prior {{to each of the}} exhibition openings, Faithfull delivered the <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> lecture in a nearby theatre, drawing on the material he had collected {{during the course of the}} journey to illustrate a meandering journey through the myths of polar exploration.|$|E
50|$|Water sky is a {{phenomenon}} that {{is closely related to}} <b>ice</b> <b>blink.</b> It forms in regions with large areas of ice and low-lying clouds and so is limited mostly to the extreme northern and southern sections of earth, in Antarctica and in the Arctic.|$|E
50|$|The Avaliks {{are forced}} to leave Silver behind so they can confront the rival pack, the wolves of Nuka River. In the fight that occurs between Kapu and the Nuka pack's alpha, Low Wind, Sweet Fur Amy and Aaka capture two Nuka wolves and bring them over to their side. The wolves, Storm Call and his sister Lichen, are the {{offspring}} of Low Wind and his mate Moon Seeker. The Avalik wolves accept them into their pack, and they return to Kangik, where they come across the strange wolf <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink,</b> and Silver′s now-lifeless body. <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> offers to join the pack, but Kapu shoots her offer down, sensing something off about her. But after a while, since their pack numbers are low, Kapu reluctantly allows her to join.|$|E
50|$|Mountain Pack: A wolf pack {{that moved}} into Raw Bones′ {{territory}} {{when he was}} away from it too long. They were led by Snow Driver (mistakenly called Storm Driver) and Cloud Berry. <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> infects the pack with rabies, and they are wiped out. Their territory as well as Raw Bones' are {{taken over by the}} Avaliks.|$|E
50|$|Kapu and Sweet Fur Amy then {{go off to}} {{retrieve}} Nutik and Uqaq, but they only make off with Uqaq before Julie stops them, explaining that the pups need to be inoculated against rabies. She had heard talk about a wolf from Canada who could be infected with the rabies virus, and the wolf in question is later revealed to be <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink.</b> Sweet Fur Amy lets Nutik go and returns to where {{the rest of the}} pack are inspecting Uqaq. As Silver is dead, and Raw Bones is showing no paternal instinct for his daughter, Sweet Fur Amy takes it upon herself to raise Uqaq. She, Uqaq, and Storm Call stay behind to wait for Nutik {{while the rest of the}} pack go off to remark their territory.|$|E
5000|$|The sculptures {{that made}} her {{significant}} {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. Fabricated from wood and painted with monochromatic layers of acrylic, they often resemble sleek, rectangular columns or pillars. Truitt produces in scale drawings of her structures that are then produced by a cabinetmaker. The structures are weighed to the ground and are often hollow, allowing the wood to breathe in changing temperatures. She applies gesso to prime the wood and then up to 40 coats of acrylic paint, alternating brushstrokes between horizontal and vertical directions and sanding between layers. The artist sought to remove any trace of her brush, sanding down each layer of paint between applications and creating perfectly finished planes of colour. [...] The layers of paint build up a surface with tangible depth. Additionally, the palpable surface of paint convey Truitt's ever-present sense of geography in the alternating vertical and horizontal paint strokes that mirror the latitude and longitude of an environment. Her process combined [...] "the immediacy of intuition, the remove of prefabrication, and the intimacy of laborious handwork." [...] The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, for instance, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color. The Arundel series of paintings, begun in 1973, features barely visible graphite lines and accumulations of white paint on white surfaces. In the custard-color <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> (1989), a tiny sliver of red {{at the bottom of the}} painting is enough to set up perspectival depth, as is a single bar of purple at the bottom of the otherwise sky-blue Memory (1981). Begun around 2001, the Piths, canvases with deliberately frayed edges and covered in thick black strokes of paint, indicate Truitt’s interest in forms that blur the lines between two and three dimensions.|$|E

40|$|Northern Canada's {{distinctive}} landscapes, its {{complex social}} {{relations and the}} contested place of the North in contemporary political, military, scientific and economic affairs have fueled recent scholarly discussion. At the same time, both {{the media and the}} wider public have shown increasing interest in the region. This timely volume extends our understanding of the environmental history of northern Canada - clarifying both its practice and promise, and providing critical perspectives on current public debates. <b>Ice</b> <b>Blink</b> provides opportunities to consider critical issues in other disciplines and geographic contexts. Contributors also examine whether distinctive approaches to environmental history are required when studying the Canadian North, and consider a range of broader questions. What, if anything, sets the study of environmental history in particular regions apart from its study elsewhere? Do environmental historians require regionally-specific research practices? How can the study of environmental history take into consideration the relations between Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the state? How can the history of regions be placed most effectively within transnational and circumpolar contexts? How relevant are historical approaches to contemporary environmental issues?Scholars from universities in Canada, the United States and Britain contribute to this examination of the relevance of historical study for contemporary arctic and sub-arctic issues, especially environmental challenges, security and sovereignty, indigenous politics and the place of science in northern affairs. By asking such questions, the volume offers lessons about the general practice of environmental history and engages an international body of scholarship that addresses the value of regional and interdisciplinary approaches. Crucially, however, it makes a distinctive contribution to the field of Canadian environmental history by identifying new areas of research and exploring how international scholarly developments might play out in the Canadian context...|$|E
