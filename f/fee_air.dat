40|$|This paper {{provides}} new {{estimates of}} efficient emission fees for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) {{emissions in the}} U. S. electricity sector. The estimates are obtained by coupling a detailed simulation model of the U. S. electricity markets with an integrated assessment model that links changes in emissions with atmospheric transport, environmental endpoints, and valuation of impacts. Efficient fees are found by comparing incremental benefits with emission levels. National quantity caps that are equivalent to these fees also are computed, and found to approximate caps under consideration in the current multi-pollutant debate in the U. S. Congress and the recent proposals from the Bush administration for the electricity industry. We also explore whether regional differentiation of caps on different pollutants is likely to enhance efficiency. emissions trading, emission <b>fees,</b> <b>air</b> pollution, cost-benefit analysis, electricity, particulates, nitrogen oxides, NOx, sulfur dioxide, SO 2, health benefits...|$|R

50|$|When Harold Holt {{replaced}} Menzies {{as prime}} minister on 26 January 1966, McMahon defeated (Sir) Paul Hasluck for the deputy leadership. As deputy, he was also treasurer (1966-69)—the post he had always wanted. He developed good relationships with his department—which contained a number of highly skilled economists—and was appointed a governor (1966-69) of the International Monetary Fund and chairman (1968-69) {{of the board of}} governors of the Asian Development Bank. Extensive knowledge of his portfolio, his understanding of economics, his inquisition of public servants and his desire to keep control of expenditure often made him unpopular, but these qualities boosted his reputation as a treasurer. He introduced four budgets, gradually reducing the deficit from $644 million in 1967-68 to $30 million in 1969-70. They were characterised by significant increased spending on defence, drought assistance, pension benefits and grants to the States, and by new Commonwealth programs for the health, education and housing of Aborigines, and for school libraries. Funding came from increased company and sales tax rates, radio and television licence <b>fees,</b> <b>air</b> navigation charges and overseas borrowings. Together with (Sir) John Gorton, he tried to resist State demands for extra revenue. Relations between the Treasury and the Department of Trade were strained even when Holt was treasurer. When McMahon became treasurer his relationship with McEwen deteriorated further. They clashed over industry protection, McMahon’s opposition to the establishment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and his (ultimately vindicated) decision not to devalue the Australian dollar. McEwen accused McMahon of being behind the Basic Industries Group, a pro-free-trade agricultural lobby that funded Western Australian and Victorian Liberals to stand against Country Party members. The governor-general, R. G. (Lord) Casey, met with McMahon to encourage him to heal relations with McEwen, but there were persistent tensions that the affable Holt found difficult to manage.|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of pollutants from energy use has effects on both local air quality and the global climate, but the price of energy does not reflect these externalities. This study aims to analyze the effect that internalizing these externalities {{in the cost of}} energy would have on the US energy system, emissions, and human health. In this study, we model different policy scenarios in which fees are added to emissions related to generation and use of energy. The fees are based on values of damages estimated in the literature and are applied to upstream and combustion emissions related to electricity generation, industrial energy use, transportation energy use, residential energy use, and commercial energy use. The energy sources and emissions are modeled through 2055 in five-year time steps. The emissions in 2045 are incorporated into a continental-scale atmospheric chemistry and transport model, CMAQ, to determine the change in air quality due to different emissions reduction scenarios. A benefit analysis tool, BenMAP, is used with the air quality results to determine the monetary benefit of emissions reductions related to the improved air quality. We apply fees to emissions associated with health impacts, climate change, and a combination of both. We find that the fees we consider lead to reductions in targeted emissions as well as co-reducing non-targeted emissions. For fees on the electric sector alone, health impacting pollutant (HIP) emissions reductions are achieved mainly through control devices while Greenhouse Gas (GHG) fees are addressed through changes in generation technologies. When sector specific fees are added, reductions come mainly from the industrial and electricity generation sectors, and are achieved through a mix of energy efficiency, increased use of renewables, and control devices. Air quality is improved in almost all areas of the country with fees, including when only GHG <b>fees</b> are applied. <b>Air</b> quality tends to improve more in regions with larger emissions reductions, especially for PM 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|Tenants in New York City's poorest {{neighborhoods are}} under attack. Despite the {{existence}} of laws such as rent stabilization to protect tenants from high rents, landlords are creating new ways to push rent stabilized tenants out of their homes. One such tactic {{is the use of}} non-rent fees, a confusing and often times unwarranted set of charges that are added to a monthly rent statement (see Figure 1). These include <b>fees</b> on appliances (<b>air</b> conditioner, washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher), legal fees, damage fees, Major Capital Improvement (MCI) rent increases and other miscellaneous fees. Often these fees appear on a tenant's rent bill without any explanation. If a tenant fails to pay, even if they are unaware of why the fee was imposed, they are sent letters that make them feel that they are being harassed and are threatened with eviction by the landlord. Most tenants have a right to object to many of these fees, and landlords are legally prohibited from taking tenants to Housing Court solely for non-payment of additional fees. But many tenants don't know their rights about the fees and often pay them when they shouldn't. For low-income and working class tenants who struggle each month to pay rent, these fees add up and make their housing costs unaffordable. While some of the fees are legal, many of them are not, and the consistency and pattern of the way the fees are being charged and collected suggests that some landlords are intentionally increasing tenants' rent burdens to push out long-term, rent stabilized tenants. This problem is proliferating in the Bronx, where New Settlement's Community Action for Safe Apartments (CASA) works to improve living conditions and maintain affordable housing. This is particularly apparent in buildings owned by Chestnut Holdings, a company that is fast becoming one of the biggest landlords of rent stabilized buildings in the Bronx. In order to learn more about how these fees are impacting rent stabilized tenants in the Bronx and develop recommendations to reform the fee collection system, members of CASA partnered with the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center, New York Communities for Change (NYCC) and Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition (NWBCCC) to conduct research about these fees. Staff and members from the above organizations collected surveys at legal clinics, tenant association meetings and organizational events. All survey respondents live in rent stabilized buildings owned by Chestnut Holdings. In total, the coalition collected 172 surveys from 23 buildings, representing 13 % of the number of apartments in those buildings. The research sample accounts for 4 % of all the apartments that Chestnut Holdings owns, and 28 % of the buildings. Researchers also collected rent bills and other supplemental materials (including letters to and from landlords, housing court decisions, and more) from 196 Chestnut Holdings tenants. Coalition members chose to focus on these buildings because they are rent stabilized and located in the neighborhoods where each organization is actively working. Data in this report comes from surveys, recent rent bills collected from Chestnut Holdings' tenants and interviews with tenants. Overall, we found that the problem of non-rent fees is serious and widespread in the Bronx. 81 % of the tenants we surveyed had been charged some sort of fee. From the rent bills we reviewed for this report, the average tenant had $ 671. 13 in non-rent fees on their most recent rent bill...|$|R
