2500|$|Historically, {{the bulk}} of UPS' {{competition}} came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU), for <b>final</b> <b>distribution.</b> This process {{is also known as}} zone skipping, long used by Parcel Consolidators.

2500|$|The company {{recommended}} to its customers to invest cash holdings in a {{money market fund}} that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets {{as a result of}} such marketing by the company. The company received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, {{as a result of its}} holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund was forced to break the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. The company was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of the company, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that [...] "an investment firm has to make money in some way." [...] The company was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, the company agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, the company settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its <b>final</b> <b>distribution</b> in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.|$|E
60|$|History {{has also}} caught and will hold firmly and well the honoured {{name of your}} father. There was no tarnish upon his {{reputation}} more than upon his character. He will be remembered in connection with great passages of European policy {{not only as a}} man of singularly searching, large, and calm intelligence, but yet more as the just man, the man that used only true weights and measures, and ever held even the balance of his ordered mind. It is no reproach to other statesmen of this or other periods, to say that scarcely any of them have had a celebrity so entirely unaided by a transitory glare. But if this be so, it implies that while they for the most part must relatively lose, he must relatively and greatly gain. If they have had stage-lights and he has had none, it is the hour when those lights are extinguished that will for the first time do that justice as between them which he was too noble, too far aloft in the tone of his mind, to desire to anticipate. All the qualities and parts in which he was great were those that are the very foundation-stones of our being; as foundation-stones they are deep, and as being deep they are withdrawn from view; but time is their witness and their friend, and in the <b>final</b> <b>distribution</b> of posthumous fame Lord Aberdeen has nothing to forfeit, he has only to receive.|$|E
60|$|Mohammed {{received}} the calif's embassador very honorably, {{and in his}} presence concealed the anger which the answer of the calif excited in his mind. As soon as the embassador was gone, however, he convened a grand council of all the great chieftains, and generals, and ministers of state in his dominions, and announced to them his determination to raise an army and march to Bagdad, {{with a view of}} deposing the calif and reigning in his stead. The great personages assembled at the council were very ready to enter into this scheme, for they knew that if it was successful there would be a great many honors {{and a great deal of}} booty that would fall to their share in the <b>final</b> <b>distribution</b> of the spoil. So they all engaged with great zeal in aiding the sultan to form and equip his army. In due time the expedition was ready, and the sultan commenced his march. But, as often happens in such cases, the preparations had been hindered by various causes of delay, and it was too late in the season when the army began to move. The forces moved slowly, too, after they commenced their march, so that the winter came on while they were among the passes of the mountains. The winter was unusually severe, and the troops suffered so much from the frosts and the rains, and from the various hardships to which they were in consequence exposed, that the sultan found it impossible to go on. He was consequently obliged to return, and begin his work over again. And the worst of it was, that the calif was now aware of his designs, and would be able, he knew, before the next season, to take effectual measures to defend himself.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Preparation and Consumption module {{is to determine the}} number of eggcontaining servings contaminated with SE and the extent of the contamination in foods originating from SE contaminated eggs. These distributions are used by the Public Health Outcomes module. This module describes exposure from the consumption of eggs and egg-containing foods that are contaminated with SE. Eggs for end-user consumption have an associated probability and level of contamination. We make assumptions about home and institutional use, pooling, types of use, and cooking practices and simulate eggs moving through different pathways. With the exception of eggs in pools, contamination of eggs after production is not modeled. Since the prevalence of contaminated eggs is very low, we model only contaminated eggs to avoid needless iterations involving hundreds of thousands of non-contaminated eggs. The <b>final</b> <b>distributions</b> represent sums of all the possible pathways through the model. The <b>final</b> <b>distributions</b> are used with the total number of eggs produced to determine the number of servings contaminated with SE. The module models sixteen different pathways through preparation and consumption. The sixteen pathways represent all the possible combinations of whether an egg is for home o...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{sequentially}} detecting an abrupt {{change in a}} sequence of independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables is addressed. Whereas previous approaches assume a known probability density function (PDF) {{at the start of}} the sequence, the problem addressed is the detection of a single change in distribution among a finite number of known 'equal-energy' PDFs, but where the initial and <b>final</b> <b>distributions</b> are not known a priori. A Bayesian multiple hypothesis approach is proposed where (i) unlike previous threshold policies, the minimum cost hypothesis is tracked through time, (ii) under an exponential delay-cost function that satisfies an upper bound determined by the distances between hypotheses, the probability of detecting a change from an incorrect initial distribution asymptotically vanishes with time, (iii) computation is recursive and constant per unit time, and (iv) the unknown initial state gives rise to unavoidable incorrect detections that be made to vanish with a constant test threshold with negligibly small effect on correct detection delay for change times beyond a lower bound. Simulations illustrate the analysis and reveal that average delay approaches that of the optimal CUSUM test after an initial transient period determined by an incorrect detection probability constraint.
