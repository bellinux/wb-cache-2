[URL] Melbourne/Cochlear multiple-electrode <b>extracochlear</b> <b>implant</b> is designed for deaf patients who are unsuited to multiple-electrode intracochlear implantation. The implant consists of a receiver-stimulator package connected via a lead wire assembly to six individual stimulating electrodes. There is a choice of two alternative surgical procedures, both of which are via a combined middle ear approach using anterior and posterior tympanotomies. Four active electrodes shaped into compressible platinum-iridium soft-balls are fed through the mastoid cavity and across the facial recess, and placed into cavities that are made over the cochlear turns that project to the medial wall of the middle ear. One hard-ball active electrode is placed into the round window niche. One hard-ball reference electrode is placed into the hypotympanum. An additional electrode wrapped around the lead wire assembly can be used as an alternative reference electrode. A specially designed insertion needle facilitates the placement and the fixation of the soft-ball electrodes. Open Acces...|$|E

Would the maturation of these functioning auditory neurons {{be affected by}} chronic cochlear stimulation? This was tested by examining neuron sizes in the cochlear nuclei of young, normal hearing kittens with and without chronic cochlear stimulation. Six animals received bilateral intra-or <b>extracochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and were electrically stimulated unilaterally for periods of 1, 000 - 1, 500 hours. After sacrifice, cross-sectional areas of approximately 11, 000 neuron somata in the cochlear nuclei were measured with an image-analysis system. There were {{statistically significant differences between}} stimulated and unstimulated nuclei, especially the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PYCN), in individual cats, but the directions of the differences were inconsistent. Overall, there was no significant effect of electrical stimulation on soma size. These results indicate that chronic electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve has no positive or negative trophic effects on otherwise innervated, maturing cochlear nucleus neurons.
