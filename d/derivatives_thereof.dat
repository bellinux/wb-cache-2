5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking.

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or <b>derivatives</b> <b>thereof)</b> in order to attract females.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{synthetic}} opioids such as methadone (1937), pethidine (1939), fentanyl (late 1950s), and <b>derivatives</b> <b>thereof</b> have been introduced, and each is preferred for certain specialized applications. Nonetheless, morphine remains the {{drug of choice}} for American combat medics, who carry packs of syrettes containing 16 milligrams each for use on severely wounded soldiers. No drug {{has been found that}} can match the painkilling effect of opioids without also duplicating much of their addictive potential.|$|E

25|$|The first {{discovery}} of a stable nitroxide radical was made in 1959. Since then, they have been developed as a versatile class of organic oxidants, both in the stoichiometric and catalytic mode. A single-electron oxidation of the nitroxide radical produces a highly electrophilic oxoammonium species, which serves as the active oxidizing agent. Although pre-formed N-oxoammonium salts may be used stoichiometrically for oxidations, these have largely been replaced by catalytic methods that use a cheaper terminal oxidant, such as sodium hypochlorite or bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB). Nitroxide radical species used are either 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) or <b>derivatives</b> <b>thereof.</b> Examples of oxoammonium-based oxidations are shown below.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} organic {{compounds}} are either systematic, following logically from {{a set of}} rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from IUPAC. [...] Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a parent structure within the molecule of interest. [...] This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. [...] Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules. [...] To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures. [...] Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and monofunctionalized <b>derivatives</b> <b>thereof.</b>|$|E
