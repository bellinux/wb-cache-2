5|$|Bishop John Harewell {{raised money}} for the {{completion}} of the west front by William Wynford, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking {{under the weight of the}} crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William <b>Joy</b> <b>to</b> brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. <b>Joy,</b> <b>to</b> supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E

5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre {{said that he would}} try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had {{one of the most memorable}} postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in <b>joy</b> <b>to</b> thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E

25|$|The first Latter Day Saint hymnal, {{which was}} {{compiled}} by Emma, {{came off the}} press in 1836 (possibly late 1835) at Kirtland, Ohio. It was titled A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter Day Saints and contained 90 hymn texts, but no music. More {{than half of the}} texts were borrowed from Protestant groups, but often changed slightly to reinforce the theology of the early church. For example, Hymn 15, changed Isaac Watts's <b>Joy</b> <b>to</b> the World from a song about Christmas to a song about the return of Christ (see <b>Joy</b> <b>to</b> the World (Phelps)). Many of these changes and a large number of the original songs included in the hymnal are attributed to W. W. Phelps.|$|E

25|$|Trading {{links between}} the United States and the East India Company's territories began when the American ship Chesapeake sailed up the Hooghly to anchor in Calcutta in 1786, just {{ten years after the}} United States Declaration of Independence.

With the advice of the then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, later the third President of the United States and consent of the Senate, President Washington commissioned <b>Joy</b> <b>to</b> that office on 21 November 1792. When Joy reached Calcutta in April 1794, the colonial government repudiated his commission. However, he was permitted to 'reside here as a Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country...', and he stayed in Calcutta and served as the commercial agent of the American government.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} home game at Soldier Field, the Bears emerged victorious {{defeating}} the Pittsburgh Steelers (17–15). The victory was short-lived as the Bears finished 6–8 {{leading to the}} termination of head coach Jim Dooley. New Coach Abe Gibron did not start his tenure any better with the Bears. The team was last place in the NFC Central division {{with a record of}} 4–9–1. The era under Gibron took a deeper dive during the 1973 season as the team finished in last place again with a record of 3–11 as the Bears were limited to just 195 total points during the entire season. Dick Butkus, who had terrorized enemy offensive players for the last eight years, retired early in the season after being hobbled by knee injuries. The 1974 season proved to be Gibron's final one with the Bears as the team finished yet again in last place, this time with a record of 4–10.
