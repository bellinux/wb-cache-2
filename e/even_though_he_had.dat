5|$|Impalement of pirates, {{rather than}} highway robbers, is also {{occasionally}} recorded. In October 1767, for example, Hassan Bey, who had preyed on Turkish {{ships in the}} Euxine Sea {{for a number of}} years, was captured and impaled, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> offered 500,000 ducats for his pardon.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2013, {{the court}} {{delivered}} a verdict, {{according to which}} Blythe was not criminally liable for Nosek's death, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the moral responsibility for it. Consequently, the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe's bail.|$|E
5|$|New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was {{prevented}} by term limits from running for mayoral reelection in 2001, immediately indicated interest. Due to his high profile and visibility, Giuliani {{was supported by}} the state Republican Party, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> irritated many by endorsing incumbent Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo over Republican George Pataki in 1994.|$|E

5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} with a 12–2 regular-season record and won the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) championship in 1946, the league's first year of play. Despite the team's strength, however, head coach Paul Brown {{made a number of}} roster moves before the beginning of 1947. He signed Tony Adamle, a fullback and linebacker who joined the team <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> two years of college eligibility left at Ohio State University, and guard Bob Gaudio, another Ohio State player. Guard Weldon Humble, who Brown recruited out of Rice University in Texas, also joined the team.|$|E

5|$|June 28, 2012: In {{the case}} of United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005's criminalization of the making of false claims of having been awarded a {{military}} medal, decoration, or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The case involved an elected official in California, Xavier Alvarez, who had falsely stated at a public meeting {{that he had been}} awarded the Medal of Honor, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never served in any branch of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, {{he was no longer}} a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under {{federal income tax}} law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was taxable {{to him at the}} time he earned the income, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already assigned part of the income to his wife, and regardless of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law. The Court in Lucas v. Earl did not rule that wages are not taxable.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet {{at the age of}} 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self-belief as they lined up for the race.|$|E
5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E

5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not {{been involved in the}} plot. Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Johnson proclaimed {{amnesty for}} all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to him <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Kalam {{was invited}} by Raja Ramanna {{to witness the}} country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the {{representative}} of TBRL, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal {{the true nature of}} these classified aerospace projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial {{to which he had}} not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{is passed}} over for an {{appointment}} as United States Secretary of State <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President.

With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P.

Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea {{despite the fact that}} higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E
