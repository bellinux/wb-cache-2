5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as <b>Fractional</b> Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new <b>fractional</b> currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new <b>fractional</b> currency notes were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. <b>Fractional</b> currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and <b>fractional</b> currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of <b>fractional</b> silver coins to redeem the outstanding <b>fractional</b> currency.|$|E

5|$|A {{continuous}} distillation {{is often a}} <b>fractional</b> distillation and can be a vacuum distillation or a steam distillation.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by <b>fractional</b> distillation from natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fractional</b> currency, also {{referred}} to as shinplasters, was introduced by the United States federal government following the outbreak of the Civil War. These <b>fractional</b> notes were in use between 21 August 1862 and 15 February 1876, and issued in 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 cent denominations across five issuing periods. The complete type set below is part of the National Numismatic Collection, housed at the National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created postage currency (which led into the use of <b>Fractional</b> currency). Postage (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US Post Office <b>fractional</b> paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving <b>fractional</b> currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E

25|$|Actually, <b>fractional</b> Fourier {{transform}} is {{a rotation}} operation {{on the time}} frequency distribution. From the definition above, for α=0, {{there will be no}} change after applying <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform, and for α=π/2, <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform becomes a Fourier transform, which rotates the time frequency distribution withπ/2. For other value ofα, <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform rotates the time frequency distribution according to α. The following figure shows the results of the <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform with different values ofα.|$|E
25|$|Möbius transformations {{are named}} in honor of August Ferdinand Möbius; they are also {{variously}} named homographies, homographic transformations, linear <b>fractional</b> transformations, bilinear transformations, or <b>fractional</b> linear transformations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> {{ownership}} {{has played}} a significant role in revitalizing the general aviation manufacturing industry since the late 1990s, and most manufacturers actively support <b>fractional</b> ownership programs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> {{programming}} studies optimization of {{ratios of}} two nonlinear functions. The special class of concave <b>fractional</b> {{programs can be}} transformed to a convex optimization problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of joining together {{with family and}} friends to share ownership of vacation property has been around for many years. But the <b>fractional</b> property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first <b>fractional</b> developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 <b>fractional</b> developments in North America in 2006 and <b>fractional</b> properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the term <b>fractional</b> ownership has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and <b>fractional</b> ownership is that with a timeshare you buy {{the right to use}} a property, but with <b>fractional</b> ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>fractional</b> part is 0.5, {{alternate}} {{round up}} and round down: {{for the first}} occurrence of a 0.5 <b>fractional</b> part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; so on so forth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> wavelet {{transform}} (FRWT) is a generalization {{of the classical}} {{wavelet transform}} in the <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform domains. This transform is capable of providing the time- and fractional-domain information simultaneously and representing signals in the time-fractional-frequency plane.|$|E
25|$|The {{quotient}} (without the remainder) {{becomes the}} whole number {{part of the}} mixed number. The remainder becomes the numerator of the <b>fractional</b> part. In the example, 2 is the whole number part and 3 is the numerator of the <b>fractional</b> part.|$|E
25|$|Large scale {{industrial}} distillation applications {{include both}} batch and continuous <b>fractional,</b> vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The {{most widely used}} industrial applications of continuous, steady-state <b>fractional</b> distillation are in petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants and natural gas processing plants.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{a series}} of basalt flows {{are assumed to be}} related to one another. A {{composition}} from which they could reasonably be produced by <b>fractional</b> crystallization is termed a parental melt. <b>Fractional</b> crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fractional</b> wavelet {{transform}} (FRWT): A generalization {{of the classical}} {{wavelet transform}} (WT) in the <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform (FRFT) domains. The FRWT is proposed in order to rectify {{the limitations of the}} WT and the FRFT. This transform not only inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT, but also has the capability of signal representations in the <b>fractional</b> domain which is similar to the FRFT. Compared with the existing FRWT, the FRWT (defined by Shi, Zhang, and Liu 2012) can offer signal representations in the time-fractional-frequency plane.|$|E

25|$|Berkshire {{acquired}} NetJets Inc. in 1998. NetJets is the world’s {{leading provider}} of <b>fractional</b> ownership programs for general aviation aircraft. In 1986, NetJets created the <b>fractional</b> ownership of aircraft concept and introduced its NetJets {{program in the}} United States with one aircraft type. In 2004, the NetJets program operated 15 aircraft types with a fleet size of nearly 650.|$|E
25|$|Icelandic króna– no <b>fractional</b> {{denomination}} in circulation, formerly {{divided into}} 100 eyrir.|$|E
25|$|There {{also exist}} related <b>fractional</b> generalizations of similar {{transforms}} {{such as the}} discrete Fourier transform.|$|E

25|$|Polyesters and {{polyamides}} {{are examples}} of condensation polymers formed by step-growth polymerization. Carothers worked out the theory of step-growth polymerization and derived the Carothers equation which relates the average degree of polymerization to the <b>fractional</b> conversion (or yield) of monomer into polymer. This equation shows that for a high molecular weight, a very high <b>fractional</b> conversion is needed (for step-growth polymers only).|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> Fourier {{transforms}} {{are also}} used to design optical systems and optimize holographic storage efficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> prices {{suggest to}} {{consumers}} that goods are marked {{at the lowest}} possible price.|$|E
25|$|Of note is that Cavalieri only {{compared}} {{areas to}} areas and volumes to volumes – these always having dimensions, while {{the notion of}} considering an area as consisting of units of area (relative to a standard unit), hence being unitless, appears to have originated with Wallis; Wallis studied <b>fractional</b> and negative powers, and the alternative to treating the computed values as unitless numbers was to interpret <b>fractional</b> and negative dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Scales are {{expressed}} in <b>fractional</b> inches, but fractions themselves are harder to work with than metric measurements.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>fractional</b> {{endeavour}} {{requires some}} sort of management, to administer {{the rules and regulations}} (which are agreed upon before the fraction is purchased) and maintain the asset to the degree laid out in the ownership documents. Generally, management will oversee the daily operation of more than one property, although it is not necessary. A single <b>fractional</b> asset may be managed by a single entity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the <b>fractional</b> Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal.|$|E
