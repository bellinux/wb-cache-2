5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin to sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> belfry.
