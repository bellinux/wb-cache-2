Software-in-the-loop and flight test results are presented. The envelope protection system is implemented as a mid-level controller component into the unmanned helicopter software infrastructure, called the Open Control Platform (OCP). The method utilizes an observer type adaptive neural network loop for the estimation of limit parameter dynamics. The constructed model is then used to predict <b>dynamic</b> <b>trim</b> response and corresponding command margins.

It can be concluded that the average sinkage of a vessel navigating in muddy channels is generally reduced by the presence of mud layers, but the <b>dynamic</b> <b>trim</b> is affected significantly by the generation of interface undulations. For ships navigating above mud layers, the maximum sinkage is comparable to or slightly less than the values occurring if the mud layer were replaced by a solid bottom.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} the Yacht Research Unit's Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel (University of Auckland) to test the effect of <b>dynamic</b> <b>trimming</b> on three IMOCA 60 inspired main-sail models in an upwind (β AW = 60 °) unheeled configuration. This study presents dynamic fluid structure interaction results in well controlled conditions (wind, sheet length) with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>trimming</b> system. Trimming oscillations are done around an optimum value of CF obj previously found with a static trim. Different oscillation amplitudes and frequencies of trimming are investigated. Measurements are done with a 6 component force balance and a load sensor giving access to the unsteady mainsail sheet load. The driving CF x and optimization target CF obj coefficient first decrease at low reduced frequency f r for quasi-steady state then increase, becoming higher than the static state situation. The driving force CF x and the optimization target coefficient CF obj show an optimum for the three different design sail shapes located at f r = 0. 255. This optimum {{is linked to the}} power transmitted to the rig and sail system by the trimming device. The effect of the camber of the design shape is also investigated. The flat mainsail design benefits more than the other mainsail designs from the <b>dynamic</b> <b>trimming</b> compared to their respective static situtation. This study presents dynamic results that cannot be accurately predicted with a quasi-static approach.

40|$|Gennakers are {{lightweight}} and flexible sails, used for downwind sailing configurations. Qualities sought {{for this kind}} of sail are propulsive force and dynamic stability. To simulate accurately the flow surrounding a sail, several problems need to be solved. Firstly, the structural code has to take into account cloth behavior, orientation and reinforcements. Moreover, wrinkles need {{to be taken into account}} through modeling or fine enough discretization. Secondly, the fluid solver needs to reproduce the atmospheric boundary layer as an input boundary condition, and be able to simulate separation. Thirdly, the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is strongly coupled due to the lightness and the flexibility of the structure. The added mass is three orders of magnitude greater than the mass of the sail, and large structural displacement occur, which makes the coupling between the two solvers difficult to achieve. Finally, the problem is unsteady, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>trimming</b> is important to the simulation of gennakers (Graf and Renzsch, 2006). As the FSI procedure is detailed in Durand (2012), the present work is rather focused on its application to downwind sail stability. The main objective of this paper is to use numerical simulations to model gennakers, in order to predict both propulsive force and sail dynamic stability. Recent developments from Durand (2012) are used to solve these problems mentioned earlier, using a finite element structural analysis program dedicated to sails and rig simulations coupled with an unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations (URANSE) solver. The FSI coupling is done through a partitioned approach with quasi-monolithic properties. An arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used, hence the fluid mesh follows the structural deformation while keeping the same topology. The fluid mesh deformation is carried out with a fast, robust and parallelized method based on the propagation of the deformation state of the sail boundary fluid faces (Durand et al., 2010). Tests were realized on a complete production chain: a sail designer from Incidences-Sails has designed two different shapes of an IMOCA 60 gennaker with the SailPack software. An automatic procedure was developed to transfer data from Sailpack to a structure input file taking into account the orientation of sailcloth and reinforcements. The same automatic procedure is used for both gennakers, in order to compare dynamic stability and propulsion forces. A new method is then developed to quantify the practical stability of a downwind sail...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an integrated semi-theoretical/numerical (CFD) method {{for the design}} of V-stepped planing hulls. Considerable resistance reductions with respect to conventional hull forms (in the order of 20 %) have been obtained by the authors following this design procedure on a number of cases. The proposed hull form design is suitable to be applied for retrofit of existing high speed crafts and it is suitable for fast yachts having a top speed in excess of 50 knots. The focus of the paper is on the combined theoretical/numerical method to effectively design optimum step configurations for high speed planing hulls, including dynamic stability. The method combines a systematic series of CFD calculations with the semi-theoretical formulations proposed by Clement based on the analogy with lifting surface theory with CFD to design the geometry of the step and wetted portion of the forward body. An application example of the combined method to the redesign of an existing high speed Deep-V planing hull in a transverse V-stepped hull is presented: a reduction of the resistance of 19 % is confirmed by CFD in this case.

40|$|In {{the context}} of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) {{application}} in ship hydrodynamic field {{it is well known}} that the numerical simulations of planing crafts are significantly less reliable rather displacement hulls. For this reason it is important to perform a comprehensive approach to the verification and validation (V&V) methodologies and procedures in order to obtain high-quality results of CFD simulations of planing hulls. In the first stage of this work, an assessment of the accuracy and effectiveness of different simulations setups and techniques for planing craft is performed, paying particular attention to the different techniques of moving mesh, such as the single moving grid, overset/chimera grid, and morphing mesh, and to the problems related to the air-water interface models, such as the numerical ventilation of the hull bottom. In the second stage the results of the V&V study for four different hull models are reported at four Froude numbers (Fr). The Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (URANS) code results are validated using benchmark experimental data obtained for three warped hulls, characterized by systematic variation of the slenderness ratio (L/B) and for one monohedral hull with comparable L/B. Grid independence, iteration, time-step, and statistical convergence analysis for response variables (resistance coefficients, wetted surfaces, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>trim</b> angles) are performed using the main uncertainty estimation methods available in the literature. The same procedures are repeated for the wave profiles analysis. The results of this work show that is possible to improve the reliability of the numerical simulation of the planing craft reducing the errors and uncertainties related to the predictions of resistance, running attitude and wave pattern. It should be note that the error has a significant hull geometry dependency. Moreover the results of the V&V study highlight that the sources of errors investigated have different importance on the numerical error and uncertainty and the modelling of the physics of the planing craft is a critical point to improve the reliability of the numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|Carefree {{handling}} {{refers to}} the ability of a pilot to operate an aircraft without the need to continuously monitor aircraft operating limits. At the heart of all carefree handling or maneuvering systems, also referred to as envelope protection systems, are algorithms and methods for predicting future limit violations. Recently, envelope protection methods that have gained more acceptance, translate limit proximity information to its equivalent in the control channel. Envelope protection algorithms either use very small prediction horizon or are static methods with no capability to adapt to changes in system configurations. Adaptive approaches maximizing prediction horizon such as <b>dynamic</b> <b>trim,</b> are only applicable to steady-state-response critical limit parameters. In this thesis, a new adaptive envelope protection method is developed that is applicable to steady-state and transient response critical limit parameters. The approach is based upon devising the most aggressive optimal control profile to the limit boundary and using it to compute control limits. Pilot-in-the-loop evaluations of the proposed approach are conducted at the Georgia Tech Carefree Maneuver lab for transient longitudinal hub moment limit protection. Carefree maneuvering is the dual of carefree handling in the realm of autonomous Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Designing a flight control system to fully and effectively utilize the operational flight envelope is very difficult. With the increasing role and demands for extreme maneuverability {{there is a need for}} developing envelope protection methods for autonomous UAVs. In this thesis, a full-authority automatic envelope protection method is proposed for limit protection in UAVs. The approach uses adaptive estimate of limit parameter dynamics and finite-time horizon predictions to detect impending limit boundary violations. Limit violations are prevented by treating the limit boundary as an obstacle and by correcting nominal control/command inputs to track a limit parameter safe-response profile near the limit boundary. The method is evaluated using software-in-the-loop and flight evaluations on the Georgia Tech unmanned rotorcraft platform- GTMax. The thesis also develops and evaluates an extension for calculating control margins based on restricting limit parameter response aggressiveness near the limit boundary. Ph. D.

This chaotic behavior {{is found in}} the basin of attraction of the nonlinear trim equations which have to be solved to determine the main rotor control inputs given by the pilot. This study focuses on the boundary of the basin of attraction obtained for a set of control inputs. We analyze the boundary by considering it at different magnification levels. The magnified views reveal intricate geometries. It is also found that the basin boundary exhibits the characteristic of statistical self-similarity, which is an essential property of fractal geometries. These results led the authors to investigate the fractal dimension of the basin boundary. It is found that this dimension is indeed greater than the topological dimension. From all the observations, it is evident that the boundary of the basin of attraction for helicopter trim problem is fractal in nature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{fundamental}} characteristics of a protein are the N- and C-termini defining the start {{and end of the}} polypeptide chain. While genetically encoded, protein termini isoforms are also often generated during translation, following which, termini are highly <b>dynamic,</b> being frequently <b>trimmed</b> at their ends by a large array of exopeptidases. Neo-termini can also be generated by endopeptidases after precise and limited proteolysis, termed processing. Necessary for the maturation of many proteins, processing can also occur afterwards, often resulting in dramatic functional consequences. Aberrant proteolysis can cause wide range of diseases like arthritis or cancer. Hence, proteolytic generation of pleiotrophic stable forms of proteins, the universal susceptibility of proteins to proteolysis, and its irreversibility, distinguishes proteolysis from many highly studied posttranslational modifications. Proteases are tightly interconnected in the protease web and their aberrant activity in disease can lead to diagnostic fragment profiles with characteristic protein termini. Following proteolysis, the newly formed protein termini can be further modified, a process that affects protein function and stability.|$|R
