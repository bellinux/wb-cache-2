5|$|Sinclair {{formed a}} similar {{arrangement}} in Mobile, Alabama between its existing Pensacola <b>duopoly</b> of ABC affiliate WEAR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX, {{and the newly}} acquired Mobile <b>duopoly</b> of NBC affiliate WPMI and independent station WJTC (owned by Deerfield Media). However, the stations were not consolidated, and maintain their own studio facilities, news departments and staff. WEAR and WPMI also produce competing 9:00 p.m. newscasts for their respective <b>duopoly</b> partners.|$|E
5|$|Both Sinclair and Nexstar became infamous {{for their}} {{frequent}} use of sidecars {{as part of their}} expansion and consolidation tactics, partnering with companies like Cunningham Broadcasting, Deerfield Media, Mission Broadcasting, and even each other {{in the case of a}} virtual <b>duopoly</b> in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania between Sinclair-owned CBS affiliate WHP-TV and Nexstar-owned CW affiliate WLYH-TV, and a former virtual <b>duopoly</b> in Rochester, New York between Nexstar-owned CBS affiliate WROC-TV and Sinclair-owned Fox affiliate WUHF (in the wake of Sinclair and Deerfield's purchase of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV, this particular arrangement ended in January 2014).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station <b>duopoly</b> between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a <b>duopoly</b> is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a <b>duopoly</b> under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E
40|$|Experimental <b>duopolies</b> are {{analyzed}} to answer two questions: Are asymmetric <b>duopolies</b> {{less likely to}} collude than symmetric <b>duopolies?</b> Is {{the time it takes}} to reach an equilibrium affected by asymmetry? In a repeated game where output is the choice, the authors have data for nineteen (respectively, twenty-one) subject pairs where both agents are low-cost (respectively, high-cost) and twenty-five subject pairs where one agent is high-cost and one is low-cost. Subjects make choices for at least thirty-five periods. Results indicate that asymmetric markets are less cooperative and take longer to reach equilibrium than symmetric markets.

40|$|Strategic play {{requires}} that players in oligopolies be {{more sophisticated than}} in perfectly competitive markets. It thus seems {{reasonable to assume that}} player experience becomes important as the environment gets more complicated. We find that subject experience indeed plays an important role. While inexperienced symmetric <b>duopolies</b> play around the Nash-Cournot quantity, experienced <b>duopolies</b> reduce output and get closer to the monopolistic outcome. Both inexperienced and experienced symmetric quadropolies,however, produce output above the Nash-Coumot equilibrium but, even in this case, output is lower for experienced quadropolies. Experience, however, does not make markets less competitive with the introduction of cost asymmetry. Under cost asymmetry, and relative to the equilibrium prediction, high cost firms produce more output than low cost firms. Analysis of individual data tells us that experienced <b>duopolies</b> and quadropolies adjust output {{in the same direction as}} their rivals. Due to the strategic substitutability of quantity choice, we interpret this as an attempt at tacitly colluding. This is true for both <b>duopolies</b> and quadropolies. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{examine how}} the level of internal conflict, and whether such conflict is transparent to other teams, affects teams' ability to compete vis-a 3 ̆ 00 -vis each other, and, consequently, market outcomes. We find that internal conflict leads to (tacit) coordination on high prices in uniform private-pay <b>duopolies,</b> but places private-pay teams at a competitive disadvantage in mixed <b>duopolies.</b> Competition is softened by transparency in uniform markets, but intensified in mixed markets...|$|R
5|$|In 1333–34, {{an attempt}} by some {{dissatisfied}} Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a <b>duopoly,</b> which was unusual in western European countries.|$|E
5|$|KHAS-TV (Hastings/Lincoln, Nebraska), {{previously}} {{owned by}} Hoak. On June 13, 2014, KHAS-TV {{was shut down}} and its NBC programming {{was moved to the}} primary channel of KSNB-TV (channel 4). Gray had bought KSNB under a failing station waiver to form a <b>duopoly</b> with CBS station KOLN/KGIN, and operated the station as a MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate with local programming focused on central Nebraska; this existing programming was moved to KSNB-DT2 upon the transition. On August 27, 2014, the station was sold to Legacy Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic <b>duopoly.</b> The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a series of {{experimental}} Bertrand <b>duopolies</b> where firms have convex costs. Theoretically these <b>duopolies</b> are characterized by a multiplicity of Nash equilibria. Using a 2 x 2 design, we analyze price choices in symmetric and asymmetric markets under 2 information conditions: complete versus incomplete information about profits. We find that information has no effect in symmetric markets with respect to market prices and the time it takes for markets to stabilize. However, in asymmetric markets, complete information leads to higher average market prices and quicker convergence of price choices. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid <b>duopoly</b> restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved {{the sale of the}} Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E
5|$|The first local {{marketing}} {{agreement in}} North American television {{was formed in}} 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased Fox affiliate WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As Sinclair had already owned independent station WPTT (now MyNetworkTV affiliate WPNT) in that market, which would have violated FCC rules {{which at the time}} had prohibited television station duopolies, Sinclair decided to sell the lower-rated WPTT to the station's manager Eddie Edwards, but continued to operate the station through an LMA (Sinclair eventually repurchased the station – then assigned the call letters WCWB – outright in 2000, after the Federal Communications Commission began permitting common ownership of two television stations in the same market, creating a legal <b>duopoly).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} partnered {{through a}} sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the <b>duopoly</b> may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, the stations may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice blocked Gannett {{from using}} an {{agreement}} with Sander Media to operate CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis alongside its own NBC station KSDK, and ordered Gannett to sell KMOV. Even though Gannett planned to operate KMOV separately from KSDK, the Department ruled the agreement to {{be a violation of}} antitrust law, as it would reduce competition for advertising sales. Following the closure of the Belo purchase, Meredith Corporation announced a deal to purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW. As Meredith would have a <b>duopoly</b> between KTVK and its Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO-TV, KASW was to be sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting and operated by Meredith under an LMA. As a result of the FCC's scrutiny on any new station sharing agreements, on October 23, 2014, Meredith would backtrack on this plan and instead sell KASW to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which would operate the station independently of KTVK and KPHO.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual <b>duopoly</b> partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by acquiring rights to its ABC and CW programming, and moving them to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South Bend to Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair's use {{of local}} {{marketing}} agreements {{would lead to}} legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as Cunningham Broadcasting) {{announced that it would}} acquire Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn's stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned WB affiliate KOCB (now a CW affiliate) would effectively constitute a <b>duopoly</b> in violation of FCC rules. The Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) filed challenges against the sale with the FCC, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn's president, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs. After the FCC updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, the FCC issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{increased}} presence of <b>duopolies</b> and outsourcing agreements since the early 2000s, the number of minor network affiliates and independent stations that produce their own newscasts has markedly decreased compared to when <b>duopolies</b> were barred under Federal Communications Commission rules prior to 2000 (as of 2013, {{there are at least}} 15 minor network affiliates or independent stations that produce their own local newscasts, most are located within the 20 largest U.S. media markets). <b>Duopolies</b> and outsourcing agreements have also affected Fox stations in a similar manner; although Fox {{is considered to be a}} major network on the same level as NBC, ABC and CBS and has urged its affiliates since the early 1990s to broadcast local news, about half of its stations broadcast local news programming through news share agreements with many of the remainder operating their own news departments. Several stations affiliated with Spanish-language networks (such as Univision and Telemundo) also broadcast their own newscasts, these stations often produce a substantially lower weekly newscast output compared to its English-language counterparts (usually limited to half-hour broadcasts in the evening, and often airing only on weeknights).|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to {{criticism of the}} virtual <b>duopolies</b> and sharing agreements, the FCC began to consider potential changes to address these loopholes. In March 2013, the Commission first tabled a proposal that would make joint sales agreements count the same as ownership.|$|R
50|$|As CBS {{has done}} with most of its other CBS/The CW <b>duopolies</b> in other markets, WPCW's web address has been folded within the KDKA website with only basic station and {{programming}} information, along with entertainment news and promotional video from The CW.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, News Corporation {{purchased}} KDFI from Dallas Media Investors, {{creating a}} legal <b>duopoly</b> with KDFW; as a result, the combination {{became the first}} television <b>duopoly</b> in the Metroplex and the first <b>duopoly</b> that Fox Television Stations operated (predating the group's acquisition of Chris-Craft/United Television's UPN-affiliated stations later that year).

25|$|Under FCC regulations, San Diego is {{the largest}} media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a <b>duopoly</b> between two full-power {{television}} stations; by law, duopolies are not allowed in any U.S. market with fewer than nine full-power stations and once a <b>duopoly</b> is formed, there must be eight unique station owners that remain in a single market. The California side of the market does not fall under either requirement as there are only seven full-power stations {{in that part of}} the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a <b>duopoly</b> under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. The Mexico-licensed stations in the market are not subject to the <b>duopoly</b> rules as two or more full-power television stations are allowed to be owned by the same company under Mexican telecommunications law (Grupo Televisa owns three stations: XETV-TV, XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV, while Entravision Communications and TV Azteca each own two stations: XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV and XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, respectively).|$|E
25|$|Due to Australia's large size, sparse population, and {{relative}} remoteness to other countries, {{a significant amount}} of infrastructure is required for Internet communications. The vast majority of Australia's international Internet transit capacity is sourced from undersea fibre-optic communications cables to Asia and the US. Until 2009 data costs across the Pacific were constrained by a Telstra–Telecom <b>duopoly</b> on the available cables. The provision of PPC-1 cable in 2009 broke this <b>duopoly</b> and caused the cost of data transmission to fall substantially. Since then Australia has enjoyed North American standards of internet access, with many ISPs providing plans with unlimited high-speed access.|$|E
50|$|Although the FCC bars common {{ownership}} {{of any of}} the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit <b>duopolies</b> involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four <b>duopolies</b> exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most <b>duopolies</b> are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV) or an independent station as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.|$|R
