40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effort that}} many organizations worldwide are making to purchase products and services that are less harmful to local and global environments. Many of these private firms are working to improve the environmental performance of their operations and products and green procurement has been a logical extension of this work. The paper presents how green procurement is used by them as a means towards improving their products and operations from environmental perspective to reduce risk, {{total cost of ownership}} and improve supply chain performance. Examples of green initiatives from Greece are presented together with references to sustainable development theory and concepts. The traditional supply positioning model is explained towards a proposed adaptation of that model to support the three dimensions of sustainable development (Environment, Economic, and Social) for Green Procurement. Results from this research are presented end entitled as “Green Supply Positioning Decision Matrix” where percentages are used to qualify procured goods and services for these three dimensions within the traditional supply chain model, but with one major difference: that the Spend dimension refers no longer to just initial acquisition cost, but to the total life cycle cost.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of green entrepreneurs in the transition towards a truly sustainable society, this paper proposes frameworks for investigating the motives of entrepreneurs who set up green businesses. Different perceptions of 'green' are explored and although the paper focuses particularly on 'green-green' businesses, the scope for investigation encompasses all possible forms of green start-ups. The main approach taken in the paper is to review the literature on entrepreneurs generally, and approaches to classifying entrepreneurs {{with a view to}} gaining useful insights for the green context. An exploratory typology of green entrepreneurs is proposed, which has been adapted and developed from Thompson's four dimensions of entrepreneurship (1998). The terms 'ethical maverick', 'ad hoc environpreneur', 'visionary champion' and 'innovative opportunist' are coined to describe different motives or orientations of the <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneur.</b> Frameworks are proposed to investigate the motives of, and influences on, green entrepreneurs. The ultimate aim is to gain insights for policy makers and educators into ways to foster green entrepreneurship. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective – This study {{attempts}} to gain knowledge about consumer attitude towards organic clothing and organic clothing stores (retailers) {{and to see}} whether there is any potential this might have for young entrepreneurs. Here {{we have tried to}} evaluate the current state of consumer awareness and knowledge in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach -The survey was conducted using mall-intercept personal survey whereby potential respondents were approached and were requested to fill up the likert-based questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed especially to elicit consumers’ buying pattern and their views on organic clothes. Consumers were asked open frame questions on their agreements and disagreements. Reliability tests were conducted to check the internal consistency of measurement items and the Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to show that there was high correlation between the items. Pearson correlation tests were also used to examine the individual relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable (intention to buy organic clothes), and subsequently Multiple Linear regression (MLR) tests using stepwise regression method were conducted to find which determinants could explain the intention to purchase organic clothes. This is just a basic research done regarding consumer’s attitude and awareness towards organic clothing and how it enhances the growing market for Small and Medium Enterprises. The local eco-entrepreneurs also find taking up a social responsibility to create awareness and encourage consumers to buy ecofriendly products. Findings – The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using Demographic Analysis of respondents, Chi-Square, ANOVA and Correlation Analysis to examine possible results that brings to the understanding of consumer knowledge, belief, perceptions and willingness to purchase and wear organic clothes. Research Limitations – the sample was restricted to a single geographic area in Malaysia and further the number of respondents may not portray the population responses with regard to organic clothes consumption. Practical implications – As Malaysians become more concerned about environment, the green consumer category will continue to grow. It is important for businesses to recognize this phenomenon and capitalize on the emerging market for environment friendly goods and services. <b>Green</b> <b>Entrepreneur</b> promotes the welfare of local people, hence he can be re-designated as Social Entrepreneu...|$|E

40|$|A {{recycling}} {{business or}} a green business which involves micro entrepreneurs {{is nothing new}} in Malaysia. Upon the country independence in 1957, <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> used to go {{from house to house}} with their bicycles or trishaws to buy used bottles as well as cooking utensils (made from copper, aluminium or irons) and old batteries to resell to bigger used items collectors for profits. But in those days, such an entrepreneurship was the last thing thought by ones who wanted to be entrepreneurs because it was considered as a low status business and least profit as well. However, at present this kind of business is steadily growing and profitable enough. As far the environmental management is concerned this kind of entrepreneurship contributes significantly to sustainability as it reduces usage of raw materials as used materials are recycled to produce new products. Notwithstanding with the contribution of this kind of business, there is a dearth of literature of green business in Malaysia as researchers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the country have concentrated their studies in the areas of finance, micro credit, human resource management, strategic management, marketing as well as leadership. Against this background, a study of green entrepreneurship is paramount. In general, amongst important questions sought in this research were: what push and/or pull factors to be <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs?</b> what strategies adopted?, what business routines of <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs?,</b> what challenges faced by the entrepreneurs?, and what the prospects of green business? This research capitalized a qualitative study where interviews were conducted with two green micro-entrepreneurs in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. The interviews were conducted at the entrepreneurs’ premises at their conveniences and were audio-recorded. The findings from the interviews provided answers to the above-mentioned research questions and to a little extent filled a void in the field of business and natural environment in the country in particular and in developing country in general...|$|R

From the descriptions and analyses of two cases study this research study suggests that a high level of environmental ambition increases the complexity of the product innovation process. Moreover, a high level of environmental ambition may hamper a product innovation process because it may lead the developers away from the market that their product is to serve. Accordingly, this research study attempts to explain and predict how environmental ambition influences new product development processes. This claim provides a theoretical contribution to existing NPD and ENPD research. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade a new idea has emerged within {{scholarly}} discussion about entrepreneuri-al theory and practice which deals explicitly with sustainable entrepreneurship. Sustainability {{as it has been}} conceptualized by the Brundtland-Commission in the late 1980 ies is orientated towards a threefold set of objectives: society/ethics, economy, and ecology. An important research question within the sustainable entrepreneurship discussion which is also addressed in this paper is to understand the nature, motivation and drivers of so-called ecopreneurs, <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs,</b> or sustainable entrepreneurs. Our findings from a field study of ten start-up firms confirm that a main characteristic of sustainable entrepreneurs is a strong emphasis on ecological aspects in their business vision as opposed to the traditional entrepreneurial aspiration to grow and create profits. In addition, they suggest that the main drivers for a sustainable entrepreneurial motivation may be structured along the social and ethical dimen-sion.

This study examined the classification of Indonesian entrepreneurs and their motivations. The data was collected by giving out a structured close-ended online survey to a number of entrepreneurs which were chosen purposively-random.

Through various student teaching and learning techniques in both countries, such as lectures, workshops, debates, field trips, different discipline working collaborations and international exchanges, the BRIDGE project was used to explore and develop with students, staff and alumni the complex subject matter of sustainable design and production and consumption which is becoming an educational requisite. The students were given theoretical and practical insight to supply and dispose chain issues, ethics, material sources, production and disposal. Current sustainability literature was debated and expert speakers on the subject were interrogated {{which led to the}} community of learners contextualising their own work within recognized scholarly texts and expert practice. Knowledge of carbon transport miles, understanding water table pollution or ethical textiles production, for example, was then applied to their product design and development. An improved understanding of better material selection for example and environmentally sound methods of production and the incorporation of design for deconstruction and re-use ensued. This applied knowledge was drawn from a transdisciplinary network and formed the basis of the development of BRIDGE’s <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> working for a more informed society.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the authors’ {{original}} insights in relation to material sustainability, design and innovation, the project findings have underlined that producers and consumers take meaning and understanding from materials and products, {{in order to give}} value to goods and these meanings should be honestly communicated. Through the many artefacts and products produced throughout the project, exhibited and discussed in the UK and France, the stakeholders began to understand the holistic narrative of and the origins, product journey and the true cost rather than price of an item. Using the transdisciplinary approach, the community of learners began to differentiate between ‘good and bad’ products and processes and relate their understanding of production and systems to the sustainable pillars in Brundtland’s description, people, profit and planet to their understanding of honest brand identity. To address the issue of green innovation in terms of production, consumption and reuse of materials, a multi-faceted approach is necessary to develop <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> and business for the discerning consumer, and as the project yielded information from those involved, giving information with integrity in as simple a way as possible transferred complex knowledge to the non-expert consumer.

40|$|In recent years, {{schemes for}} payment for {{ecosystem}} services PES {{have emerged in}} tropical countries. Besides public demand, the private demand offers {{the opportunity to develop}} PES. The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate the potential demand by firms for four ecosystem services from tropical forests: biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, scenic beauty, and watershed protection. Those are the four granted in the forest legislation and rewarded for in the PES scheme in Costa Rica. To explain stated willingness to invest WTI, we assess influential factors: expectations with respect to financial and non-financial benefits of investing in ecosystem services; experience with forest ecosystem services; firm attributes, like origin, sector membership, and size; and finally, perceived behavioral control. We sent a questionnaire to over 900 international and Costa Rican firms from different sectors. The low response rate of the survey of overall 6 % can be explained by - in a business context - rather new topic of ecosystem services from tropical forests. The analysis showed that a firm's willingness to invest (WTI) depends on the origin of the firm. International firms are interested in buying certificates mainly for carbon sequestration; Costa Rican firms, for all four ecosystem services in the following order: watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and scenic beauty. Indirect and non-financial benefits are surprisingly important and can impede the development of ecosystem service markets. At the same time, the activities of intrinsically motivated <b>green</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> in a financially oriented firm setting might be a prerequisite within a firm context for bringing such innovative topics as ecosystem services from tropical forests to the table.

Any entrepreneur that seeks to start a new venture in an emerging industry will face resource and time constraints. The question we raise here is how the entrepreneur should prioritize use of time and resources to increase likeliness of success. To address this question we depart from a theoretical perspective of entrepreneurship seen as judgment, and bridges it over to entrepreneurship seen as co-creation. In other words, we combine the subjective with the intersubjective, and explore the effects of the actions successful <b>green</b> technology <b>entrepreneurs</b> in the emerging offshore renewable energy industry make in building their new ventures in nascent markets. Inspired by earlier studies on market entry, combined with new ways to understand new venture emergence, we find that independent entrepreneurs benefit from leapfrogging typical stages in the technology development process and rather devote time and efforts on resource acquisition. We also find that the most important value-capturing, decision-making heuristics are those related to “hybrid governance”. We discuss implications for theory, practice, and policy...|$|R
