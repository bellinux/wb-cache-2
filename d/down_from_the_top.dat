5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men come <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E

A few minutes later she calls for an ambulance, but is {{hit by a car}} before she can. As Connie regains consciousness, she notices Grace Beauchamp's (Emily Carey) shoe in the car. Flames begin erupting from the vehicle. Connie moves towards the car but before she can get to Grace it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups {{to protect them from}} North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top).</b> In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
5|$|Stewart, Harvick and Edwards led at the lap 57 restart. Two laps later, Earnhardt and Edwards {{temporarily}} {{moved to}} the front of the field but Stewart retook the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, McMurray drove <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> lane after exiting turn two, and went into Almirola in the middle lane, causing Almirola to make contact with Danica Patrick on the backstraightaway, sending her car spinning 180 degrees, and straight into the inside wall which she hit with her right-hand side, sustaining heavy damage to her car. The crash caused the third and final caution of the race to be shown. Patrick was unhurt; she was able to walk to an ambulance that took her to the in-field medical center. The field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Stewart the victory; Earnhardt finished second, and Ambrose finished third. Burton and Edwards completed the top five finishers. McDowell and Robby Gordon earned transfers to qualify for the Daytona 500. The first race had a total of three cautions and eight lead changes among five different drivers. Hamlin's total of 27 laps led was the most of any competitor. Stewart led three times for a total of 21 laps.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas is {{dehydrated}} by {{ethylene glycol}}. In this application, ethylene glycol flows <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a tower and meets a rising mixture of water vapor and hydrocarbon gases. Dry gas exits {{from the top}} of the tower. The glycol and water are separated, and the glycol recycled. Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (triethylene glycol) is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the injection rate for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a glycol dehydration tower.|$|E
25|$|Various {{ornaments}} of {{the nasal}} boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus. Both P. lakustai and P. perotorum bore a jagged, comb-like extension {{at the tip of}} the boss which was missing in P. canadensis. P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion {{of the nasal}} boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> edge of the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.|$|E
25|$|The crest is also {{designed}} {{to stress the}} pursuit of knowledge. It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel. Having been originally worn on the helmet of a fully armed person, the crest is always placed {{on the top of}} the helm. The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration and, in the University’s arms, this is effected by the use of a wreath and a crown. The wreath is silver, red and black, these colours being taken from the shield. It is surmounted by a mural crown (resembling a wall), which is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations. The cloth mantling which hangs <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the helm is the survival of the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour, coloured in the two principal colours of the shield, blue and gold.|$|E

25|$|Vito Di Giorgio, a Black Handler {{and grocery}} store owner, {{moved to the}} United States from Palermo, Sicily in 1904, and to Los Angeles from New Orleans in 1920. He was {{possibly}} the first boss of {{what would become the}} Los Angeles crime family. With the continuing Ardizzone-Matranga feud, Di Giorgio was able to relocate to Los Angeles and bring some order to the Los Angeles underworld. Di Giorgio was known as an intimidating and forceful man who was in conflict with several local underworld factions. Di Giorgio maintained strong connections with mobsters in New Orleans, Colorado, and Chicago, and was a cousin, close friend, and mob associate of New York City mobster Giuseppe Morello, the first boss of the Morello crime family. He survived two attempts on his life before he was murdered in Chicago in 1922 while having a haircut. His underboss Rosario DeSimone, who moved from Pueblo, Colorado to Los Angeles around the same time as Di Giorgio, was another longtime power figure who took control of rackets quietly in Los Angeles County. DeSimone officially stepped <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> position in the 1920s, but was still the real power within his organization.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{deposits}} {{are affected}} by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect {{at the bottom of a}} river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} was between Dusty Rhodes and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhodes had the early {{advantage}} by performing bionic elbows. Rhodes targeted Flair's right foot {{and sent it}} into the ringpost. After throwing Flair <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> turnbuckle, Rhodes attempted to apply the figure four leglock. Flair kicked him off, and Rhodes hurt his injured left ankle. Flair failed to apply the figure four leglock, and Rhodes sent Flair outside. Rhodes sent Flair's head into the ringpost and guard rail, and performed a diving crossbody and mounted punches. Rhodes then missed a kick with his left foot, and Flair gained the advantage. Flair targeted the left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Flair broke the hold when Rhodes rolled onto his stomach. After exchanging attacks, Rhodes performed a clothesline, and pulled Flair into the referee, knocking him outside the ring. Rhodes applied the figure four leglock, as Ole and Arn Anderson came down to interfere. Rhodes kicked Arn out, but Ole performed a high knee to Rhodes from behind. A new referee came down to officiate, and as Flair picked up Rhodes, Rhodes pinned him with an inside cradle to win the match and the title.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are {{in direct contact with}} the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} bird flight itself is still hotly debated. It {{is clear that}} {{feathers}} {{must have been a}} prerequisite for flight in birds (though flight may have not been a prerequisite for feathers). There has yet to be a consensus on whether flight involved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground up or the trees down, and Heilmann was largely responsible for popularizing the trees-down idea early on. The modern idea of the arboreal (or trees-down) hypothesis has changed little since Heilmann's time, and it states that bird flight would have originated by climbing birds gliding <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of trees, making gliding a precursor to flapping or powered flight. As these early birds became more efficient gliders, they would have begun to extend their range and capability by developing more powerful flight. In this proposed mode of bird evolution, Heilmann's [...] "Proavis" [...] is strongly implicated, which would have probably been a climbing, perching, early-stage gliding quadruped. This hypothesis for the origin of bird flight has had many adherents, including Walter J. Bock and Alan Feduccia.|$|R
