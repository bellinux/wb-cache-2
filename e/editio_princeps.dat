5|$|A later {{version of}} the Codex Palatinus (possibly a version that was made for Petrarch in 1356) was {{the basis of the}} <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the History, {{published}} in Milan in 1475. A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at Venice in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by Desiderius Erasmus, and published by Johann Froben in Basel in 1518.|$|E

25|$|Three {{different}} printings of Pius V's Roman Missal, {{with minor}} variations, appeared in 1570, a folio and a quarto edition in Rome and a folio edition in Venice. A reproduction {{of what is}} considered to be the earliest, referred to therefore as the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps,</b> was produced in 1998. In the course of the printing of the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps,</b> some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages. There were several printings again in the following year 1571, with various corrections of the text.|$|E
25|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the text}} was rediscovered in Vienna in 1442 by the Italian humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini. Its <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> was issued in 1515 by Konrad Peutinger, followed by many other editions.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the codex}} was {{published}} by William Hatch and Bradford Welles in 1958 (<b>editio</b> <b>princeps).</b> Kurt Aland catalogued the manuscript {{on the list of}} the New Testament papyri under the number 49.|$|E
25|$|Western {{scholars}} in the 19th century adopted Devanagari for printed editions of Sanskrit texts. The <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the Rigveda by Max Müller was in Devanagari. Müller's London typesetters competed with their Petersburg peers working on Böhtlingk's and Roth's dictionary in cutting all the required ligature types.|$|E
25|$|Arithmetica {{was first}} {{translated}} from Greek into Latin by Bombelli in 1570, but the translation was never published. However, Bombelli borrowed {{many of the}} problems for his own book Algebra. The <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of Arithmetica was published in 1575 by Xylander. The best known Latin translation of Arithmetica was made by Bachet in 1621 and became the first Latin edition that was widely available. Pierre de Fermat owned a copy, studied it, and made notes in the margins.|$|E
25|$|It is to {{be noted}} that in the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the Yalḳuṭ (Salonica, 1526–27) {{the source of the}} legend of the fallen angels (in § 44) {{as well as of the}} legend {{concerning}} the temptation of R. Mattithiah b. Ḥeresh by Satan (in § 161), who was successfully resisted by the pious hero, is simply the ordinary midrash, not the Midrash Abkir. The latter legend is found also in the Midrash of the Ten Commandments (Jellinek, l.c. i. 79) and in Tanḥuma (ed. S. Buber, Ḥuḳḳat, Addenda, § 1).|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} manuscripts dated solely by palaeography, the dating of 46 is uncertain. The first editor {{of parts of}} the papyrus, H. A. Sanders, {{proposed}} a date possibly {{as late as the}} second half of the 3rd century. F. G. Kenyon, editor of the complete <b>editio</b> <b>princeps,</b> preferred a date in the first half of the 3rd century. The manuscript is now sometimes dated to about 200. Young Kyu Kim has argued for an exceptionally early date of c. 80. Griffin critiqued and disputed Kim's dating, placing the 'most probable date' between 175–225, with a '95% confidence interval' for a date between 150–250.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{appears in}} India around the 3rd century BC {{in the form}} of the Brāhmī script, but texts of the length of the Rigveda were likely not written down until much later, and the oldest extant manuscripts date to AD ~1040, {{discovered}} in Nepal. While written manuscripts were used for teaching in medieval times, they were written on birch bark or palm leaves, which decompose and therefore were routinely copied over the generations to help preserve the text. Some Rigveda commentaries may date from the second half of the first millennium AD. The hymns were thus composed and preserved by oral tradition for several millennia from the time of their composition until the redaction of the Rigveda, and the entire Rigveda was preserved in shakhas for another 2,500 years from the time of its redaction until the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> by Rosen, Aufrecht and Max Müller.|$|E
500|$|The {{works of}} Archimedes {{were written in}} Doric Greek, the dialect of ancient Syracuse. The written work of Archimedes has not survived {{as well as that}} of Euclid, and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through {{references}} made to them by other authors. Pappus of Alexandria mentions On Sphere-Making and another work on polyhedra, while Theon of Alexandria quotes a remark about refraction from the [...] Catoptrica. During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in Alexandria. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the Byzantine Greek architect Isidore of Miletus (c. 530AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by Thābit ibn Qurra (836–901AD), and Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187AD). During the Renaissance, the <b>Editio</b> <b>Princeps</b> (First Edition) was published in Basel in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin. Around the year 1586 Galileo Galilei invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invention}} of the printing press, the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the Astronomica was published in Nuremberg around 1473 by the astronomer Regiomontanus from an error-riddled Italian copy. The text was then critically edited by Joseph Justus Scaliger, whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the Codex Gemblacensis, was published in Leiden in 15991600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by Johann Heinrich Boeckler. An updated edition was published by Richard Bentley in 1739. Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional editio minor in 1932). According to Volk, [...] " [...] work is famoussome might say notoriousfor its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars." [...] In 1977, G. P. Goold published a Loeb English translation, collated both from manuscript M and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to Housman; this release marked {{the first time that the}} poem had been translated into English prose (the first book of the Astronomica had previously been translated into English by Edward Sherburne in 1674, and Thomas Creech had translated the entire poem into English verse in 1697). Goold's translation (complete with substantial introductory notes and diagrams) was called [...] "masterly" [...] by Volk and Steven Green, both of whom argued that it [...] "marked a significant development in the accessibility of Manilius to a larger audience". Goold later issued a second edition of his translation in 1992, as well as a corrected edition in 1997 that included information from W. S. Watt's article [...] "Maniliana".|$|E

2500|$|The <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the Africa {{was first}} {{published}} and printed, as part of Petrarch's collected works (Opera omnia) at Venice in 1501. Petrarch's epic poem was printed again as a Venetian edition in 1503. There were also in 1554 to 1558 Basel editions printed which forms the basis for all later editions. In 1872 it received special treatment in Paris by L. Pingaud. In 1874 came an edition by Francesco Corradini from Padua. In 1884, by V.Develay, in Paris.

2500|$|The first {{published}} translation of any {{portion of the}} Rigveda in any European language was into Latin, by Friedrich August Rosen (Rigvedae specimen, London 1830).

2500|$|His {{handling}} {{from his}} earliest printers was little better. The <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> was printed in 1474 in Rome by Georg Sachsel and Bartholomaeus Golsch from [...] "the {{worst of the}} recentiores", which broke off {{at the end of}} Book 26. The next edition (Bologna, 1517) suffered from its editor's [...] "monstrously bad conjectures" [...] upon the poor text of the 1474 edition; the 1474 edition was pirated for the first Froben edition (Basle, 1518). It wasn't until 1533 that the last five books of Ammianus' history were put into print by Silvanus Otmar and edited by Mariangelus Accursius. The first modern edition was produced by C.U. Clark (Berlin, 1910–1913). The first English translations were by Philemon Holland in 1609, and later by C.D. Yonge in 1862.|$|E

2500|$|In 1596, they succeeded, and Casaubon {{accepted}} a {{post at the}} University of Montpellier, with the titles of conseiller du roi (king's advisor) and professeur stipendié aux langues et bonnes lettres (salaried professor of languages and literatures). [...] He stayed there for only three years, with several prolonged absences. [...] He was badly treated and poorly paid by the university authorities. [...] Casaubon {{began to see the}} editing of Greek books as a more suitable job for him. [...] At Geneva he had produced some notes on Diogenes Laertius, Theocritus and the New Testament. He debuted as an editor with a complete edition of Strabo (1587), of which he was so ashamed afterwards that he apologized to Scaliger for it. This was followed by the text of Polyaenus, an <b>editio</b> <b>princeps,</b> 1589; a text of Aristotle, 1590; and a few notes contributed to Estienne's editions of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Pliny's Epistolae. His edition of Theophrastus's Characteres (1592), is the first example of his peculiar style of illustrative commentary, at once apposite and profuse. [...] When he left for Montpellier he was already engaged upon his magnum opus, his editing of and commentary on Athenaeus.|$|E
2500|$|The Peshitta {{had from}} the 5th century onward a wide {{circulation}} in the East, and was accepted and honored by the whole diversity of sects of Syriac Christianity. It had a great missionary influence: the Armenian and Georgian versions, {{as well as the}} Arabic and the Persian, owe not a little to the Syriac. The famous Nestorian tablet of Chang'an witnesses to the presence of the Syriac scriptures in the heart of China in the 8th century. The Peshitta was first brought to the West by Moses of Mindin, a noted Syrian ecclesiastic who unsuccessfully sought a patron for the work of printing it in Rome and Venice. However, he was successful in finding such a patron in the Imperial Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire at Vienna in 1555—Albert Widmanstadt. He undertook the printing of the New Testament, and the emperor bore the cost of the special types which had to be cast for its issue in Syriac. Immanuel Tremellius, the converted Jew whose scholarship was so valuable to the English reformers and divines, made use of it, and in 1569 issued a Syriac New Testament in Hebrew letters. In 1645, the <b>editio</b> <b>princeps</b> of the Old Testament was prepared by Gabriel Sionita for the Paris Polyglot, and in 1657 the whole Peshitta found a place in Walton's London Polyglot. For long the best edition of the Peshitta was that of John Leusden and Karl Schaaf, and it is still quoted under the symbol [...] "Syrschaaf", or [...] "SyrSch". The critical edition of the gospels recently issued by G. H. Gwilliam at the Clarendon Press is based upon some 50 manuscripts. Considering the revival of Syriac scholarship, and the large company of workers engaged in this field, we may expect further contributions of a similar character to a new and complete critical edition of the Peshitta.|$|E
