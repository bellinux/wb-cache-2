50|$|Ionic bonding {{is a type}} of {{chemical}} bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more electrons (termed cations) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed anions). This transfer of electrons is termed <b>electrovalence</b> in contrast to covalence. In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH4+ or SO42−. In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.|$|E

This paper introduces {{the development of}} ice-storage projects in the past decade, the number of projects and cool-storage capacity with different ice-storage products. Also, main characteristics of the built projects are analyzed. It is indicated that application of ice-storage projects is becoming prevalent and the technology and products are increasingly grown up. However, the number of practical projects is still small {{when compared with the}} potential of electricity peak load shaving and there is a widely developing space for the future. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} underpotential {{deposition}} of Cu on single-crystal Au(111) electrodes in sulfate-containing electrolytes {{by a combination}} of computational statistical-mechanics based lattice-gas modeling and experiments. The experimental methods are in situ cyclic voltammetry and coulometry and ex situ Auger electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. The experimentally obtained voltammetric current and charge densities and adsorbate coverages are compared with the predictions of a two-component lattice-gas model for the coadsorption of Cu and sulfate. This model includes effective, lateral interactions out to fourth-nearest neighbors. Using group-theoretical ground-state calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate effective <b>electrovalences</b> and lateral adsorbate [...] adsorbate interactions so as to obtain overall agreement with experiments, including both our own and those of other groups. In agreement with earlier work, we find a mixed R 3 xR 3 phase consisting of 2 / 3 monolayer Cu and 1 / 3 monolayer sulfate at intermediate electrode potentials, delimited by phase transitions at both higher and lower potentials. Our approach provides estimates of the effective <b>electrovalences</b> and lateral interaction energies, which cannot yet be calculated by first-principles methods.

Firstly, {{from the perspective of}} clean energy development,utilization and increasing in wind farm investment income, this paper has analyzed the reason of wind energy curtailment, and summarized effective policies for the management of wind energy curtailment from all over the world. On this basis, this paper considered the loss of interest of thermal units during wind power peak regulation, in order to enhance the enthusiasm of thermal units to participate wind power and thermal power bale delivery, this paper has established wind power, thermal power bale delivery model of calculation of interest. From the numerical example, we conclude that after wind power and thermal power generation rights trading, the wind turbine will get higher revenue due to higher pool purchase price,while thermal power units are exposed to a loss because the tradeoff price is lower than the stake <b>electrovalence...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{montmorillonite}} {{composite structure}} samples were prepared using a hydrolysation-intercalation composite method with TiOSO 4 · 2 H 2 O as a precursor of TiO 2 nano-particles and montmorillonite as substrate by controlling the pH {{value of the}} montmorillonite suspension. The changes of the structure, phase and crystal size of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction method. The {{results show that the}} pH value of montmorillonite suspension has a significant influence on the hydrolyzation of TiOSO 4 · 2 H 2 O, so the composite structure of hydrated- titanium-oxide/montmorillonite is affected. When the pH value of montmorillonite suspension is 0. 5, the poly-titanium-ions are with the lower <b>electrovalence</b> and extent of polymerization and easily intercalate the interlayer space of montmorillonite, moreover, the structural layers of montmorillonite are separated best. The crystal size of anatase in the TiO 2 /montmorillonite composite samples calcinated at 700 ¡䟩s smallest and reaches 13. 4 nm. After calcination at 1100 ¡䪠the relative content of anatase in the composite structure reaches 35 %. Compared with pure TiO 2 nano-particle sample, TiO 2 /Montmorillonite composite sample has a higher phase transition temperature from anatase phase to rutile phase and smaller crystal size of TiO 2. Montmorillonite structure layer has a significant blocking effect on the TiO 2 phase transformation and grain growth...|$|E

The UPD Cu, Cd and Pb on Pt were analysed {{in terms of their}} influence in the oxygen evolution reaction. Partial blockage of surface active sites, promoted by Pb ad-atoms, resulted in a change from water to hydrogen peroxide as the final product. The Ag UPD on Pt and Au substrates was also discussed in this work. A detailed model of charge calculation for Ag monolayer was developed and confirmed by the rotating ring-disk data. The partial charge transfer in UPD studies was analysed in the Cd/Pt and Cd/Au systems and a value of 0. 5 was found for the adsorption <b>electrovalence</b> of Cd ad-ions. The Sn/Pt UPD systems were studied {{from the point of view}} of the valences of metallic ions in solution. The deposition from Sn(IV) generates a full monolayer with a maximum occupation of approximately 40 % of the surface active sites (340 µC cm- 2) plus 105 µC cm- 2 of Hads (half monolayer). Changing the metallic ion for Sn(II), it was possible to deposit a full monolayer (210 µC cm- 2) without any detectable Hads. Finally, the effect of anions was discussed in the Zn/Pt and Zn/Au systems. Here, the hydrogen evolution reaction (her) and the hydrogen adsorption/desorption were used in order to investigate the maximum coverage of the surface with Zn ad-atoms. The full monolayer, characterised by the complete absence of Hads, was achieved only in 0. 5 M HF solutions...|$|E
