5|$|The book {{contained}} {{excerpts of}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> {{that is supposed}} to be sealed and confidential by law. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources and at one point faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of Victor Conte's lawyers, pleaded guilty to leaking <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony.</b> Through the plea agreement, he will spend {{two and a half years}} in jail.|$|E

5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony,</b> Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{transient}} {{and otherwise}} unaccounted-for stranger {{was a suspect}} in the murders. One such suspect was a man named Andy Sawyer. No real evidence linked Sawyer to the crime, but his name came up often in <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimonies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Attorney General Linda Kelly {{prepared}} a presentment which included credibility determinations about the testimonies received {{before the first}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for the second <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> The 33rd Statewide Investigating <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> continued looking into the investigation. This <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> heard <b>testimony</b> from Victim 3, Victim 5, and Victim 6. Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said that during the investigation there was an [...] "uncooperative atmosphere" [...] {{from some of the}} officials.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> heard <b>testimony</b> from 42 {{witnesses}} to the lynching, including twelve black men who were held in the jail. [...] Although state police officers personally identified nine men as acting leaders of the mob, a local jury declined to indict anyone for Armwood's murder.|$|R
5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony,</b> which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E

25|$|During Libby's trial, the {{prosecution}} focused the jury on {{a sequence of}} events occurring between May and July 2003. According to prosecutors, given the level of interest coming from the Vice President's office regarding Joe Wilson, {{it was impossible for}} Libby to have forgotten during his FBI interviews and <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> that he already knew that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.|$|E
25|$|In his <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony,</b> Rove testified {{he learned}} of Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E
25|$|At Libby's trial, Russert was {{questioned}} by prosecutors for only 12 minutes, but underwent {{more than five}} hours of pointed cross-examination over two days from defense attorney Theodore Wells Jr. Russert told prosecutors {{that he could not}} have told Libby about Plame because he had not heard of her until she was publicly revealed by Novak on July 14, 2003, four days after Russert spoke with Libby by phone. Wells challenged Russert's memory and his version of the events that led to his crucial <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony.</b> Wells also questioned Russert about his reaction to the announcement of Libby's grand jury indictment.|$|E
25|$|In late November 2004, {{outgoing}} Albany County District Attorney Paul Clyne {{convened a}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to hear <b>testimony</b> implicating Christopher Porco in the murder.

25|$|In Brady v. Maryland it {{was ruled}} that the {{suppression}} of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the prosecutor, where such evidence is material to the guilt or punishment of the accused. The failure {{of the government to}} produce exculpatory evidence may or may not fall {{within the confines of the}} Jencks Act. In some cases, the production of documents must be made at a time prior to that required by the Jencks Act. The Brady rule may require the prosecutor to disclose <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> prior to trial, if the information is exculpatory, as well as other Brady material.|$|E
25|$|On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret {{testimony}} {{to a grand}} jury. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the 18½-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts {{turned over to the}} House Judiciary Committee, using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Aided by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the historian Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the Nixon White House tapes, sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony.</b>|$|E
25|$|CNN {{reported}} that federal investigators were looking into {{whether or not}} Bonds committed perjury during his 2003 <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> relating to the BALCO steroids scandal when he testified that he believed a clear substance and a cream, {{given to him by}} personal trainer Greg Anderson, were flaxseed oil and arthritis balm. The United States Attorney's Office in San Francisco brought evidence before another grand jury to determine if Bonds should be indicted. Before testifying to the original grand jury (in 2003), witnesses including Bonds were told that they could not be charged with any crime other than perjury based on their testimony. On July 5, 2006, Anderson was found in contempt of court by U.S. District Judge William Alsup for refusing to testify before the grand jury investigating perjury accusations against Bonds. Anderson was denied bail and immediately sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California.|$|E

Additionally, he testified before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> Crabbe's <b>testimony</b> resulted in a sealed indictment for Ricardo Roman. Roman was indicted on July 17, 2007 and arrested on July 31, 2007 in South Texas. On February 15, 2008, the Travis County District Attorney's office dismissed the indictment against Roman.|$|R

50|$|Since 2003, Bonds {{has been}} {{a key figure in}} the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) scandal. BALCO marketed {{tetrahydrogestrinone}} ("the Clear"), a performance-enhancing steroid that was undetectable by doping tests. He was under investigation by a federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> regarding his <b>testimony</b> in the BALCO case, and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on November 15, 2007.

25|$|The Jencks Act, , {{provides}} {{that the government}} (prosecutor) is required to produce a verbatim statement or report made by a government witness or prospective government witness (other than the defendant), but only after the witness has testified. Jencks material is evidence that {{is used in the}} course of a federal criminal prosecution in the United States. It usually consists of documents relied upon by government witnesses who testify at trial. The material is described as inculpatory, favoring the United States government’s prosecution of a criminal defendant. The Jencks Act also covers other documents related to the testimony, or relied upon by government witnesses at trial. Typically, the material may consist of police notes, memoranda, reports, summaries, letters, related to an indictment or verbatim transcripts used by government agents or employees to testify at trial. This also includes a witness's <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony,</b> if the witness testified at trial.|$|E
25|$|During <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>testimony</b> in December 2003 – {{which was}} {{illegally}} {{leaked to the}} San Francisco Chronicle and published in December 2004 – Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health {{in the past few}} years). The reports that came from the San Francisco Chronicle were done by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, who revealed that the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative did not merely manufacture nutritional supplements, but also distributed exotic steroids. Williams and Fairanu-Wada also provided compelling evidence that Bonds, arguably the greatest player of his generation, was one of BALCO's steroid clients. The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that Greg Anderson gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements. Based on the testimony from many of the athletes, Conte and Anderson accepted plea agreements from the government in 2005 on charges they distributed steroids and laundered money to avoid significant time in jail. Conte received a sentence of four months in jail, Anderson received a sentence of three months. Also that year, James Valente, the vice president of Balco, and Remi Korchemny, a track coach affiliated with BALCO, pleaded guilty to distributing banned substances and received probation.|$|E

This testimony, as reported by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using [...] "the cream" [...] and [...] "the clear".|$|E
5000|$|He {{was arrested}} in 1914 when the car he was driving ran over and killed Herbert George Loveday, the choir {{director}} of St Mary's Church, in Tuxedo Park, New York.

5000|$|After {{the federal}} jury deadlocked {{on the death}} penalty, which {{resulted}} in a life sentence, citizens of Oklahoma petitioned to empanel a state court <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to investigate the bombing.

A <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> heard <b>testimony</b> for 18 months about allegations of other accomplices but returned only the indictments against Nichols in March 1999. Oklahoma County District Attorney Wes Lane denied the state prosecution was conducted solely for the purpose of having Nichols executed, saying it was important Nichols be convicted of killing all the victims.

500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped {{her in a}} hallway in 1993. An {{independent}} counsel determined Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.
