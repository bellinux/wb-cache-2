5|$|For a long time, it {{was normal}} {{procedure}} for a decommissioned blast furnace to be demolished and either {{be replaced with}} a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> use of the area. In recent decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces {{as a part of}} their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned steel mills were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other such sites exist in Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Health tourism {{providers}} {{have developed}} as intermediaries which unite potential medical tourists with provider hospitals and other organizations. Companies {{that focus on}} medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They may also help provide resources <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> care upon the patient's return.|$|E

25|$|Mammography is {{a common}} {{screening}} method, since it is relatively fast and widely available in developed countries. Mammography {{is a type of}} radiography used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> views (called diagnostic mammography), and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called screening mammography).|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{radiography}} is useful, both {{by itself}} and {{in conjunction with}} CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires {{a substantial amount of}} bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{disadvantages}} of this method is that the light variation effect is very small. A Jovian-mass planet orbiting 0.025 AU away from a Sun-like star is barely detectable even when the orbit is edge-on. This is not an ideal method for discovering new planets, {{as the amount of}} emitted and reflected starlight from the planet is usually much larger than light variations due to relativistic beaming. This method is still useful, however, as it allows for measurement of the planet's mass without the need <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> data collection from radial velocity observations.|$|E

25|$|Tracking Troop {{was also}} sedulous and {{operated}} out of Base Group {{in the same}} manner as Signals Troop; a number of specialist trackers would be attached to a Commando as/when required to be dropped onto spoor <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> work. The new Selous Scouts Regiment had requested some specialist trackers for a combative tracking unit, so Tracking Troop was disbanded and a distinct home found for everyone concerned — primarily within the Selous Scouts unit and RLI, but also the SAS (Rhodesian Special Air Service). The majority were transmigrated to Support Group where they eventually became known as Reconnaissance Troop after the change to a Commando was actualised.|$|E
25|$|HIPAA {{restrictions}} on researchers have affected {{their ability to}} perform retrospective, chart-based research {{as well as their}} ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them <b>for</b> <b>follow-up.</b> A study from the University of Michigan demonstrated that implementation of the HIPAA Privacy rule resulted in a drop from 96% to 34% in the proportion of follow-up surveys completed by study patients being followed after a heart attack. Another study, detailing the effects of HIPAA on recruitment for a study on cancer prevention, demonstrated that HIPAA-mandated changes led to a 73% decrease in patient accrual, a tripling of time spent recruiting patients, and a tripling of mean recruitment costs.|$|E
25|$|This proposal, for {{the first}} time, made a solid {{argument}} for ABM deployment as a counterforce weapon. Previously each ABM required a corresponding warhead to offset it, but with LoADS and MPS, a single ABM required multiple warheads to offset it. The same end could be achieved by simply building more shelters as well, but {{the size of the}} proposed MPS network already took up large portions of Nevada and Utah, and adding more would not be easy. Even a high unit price, LoADS would still be less expensive than building double the number of shelters. Additionally, as each set of MPS shelters, or cells, would have only a single LoADS, the problems with nuclear blackout causing problems <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> shots was not an issue, a problem that had never been solved in Safeguard-like solutions.|$|E

25|$|Once the Report is {{submitted}} to the Ministry of Law and Justice, {{the task of the}} Commission ends unless it is required to rework upon identified areas of provide clarifications by the Government on the report submitted. Upon receipt of the Report, it is the responsible <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> action on the recommendations made by the Commission in the Report. Generally the Ministry of Law and Justice forwards the Report with its remarks to other relevant Ministries in the Government of India and seeks from them their opinion on the relevance of the recommendation and finalizes with them the manner of implemendation of these recommendations. When the proposals are cleared by the various Ministries and approved by the Cabinet, the Ministry of Law and Justice goes for drafting of the implementing legislation or follows the draft submitted by the Law Commission (which usually is the case) and presents the same for approval before the Parliament.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability {{is central}} to {{underpinning}} feelings of authenticity in tourism. Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, {{and at the same}} time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential [...] "felt" [...] authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.|$|E
500|$|Operation Swath-10 (...) was a {{military}} offensive undertaken by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska, or HV) against the SAO Western Slavonia Territorial Defense Forces on Bilogora Mountain in western Slavonia.

[...] His early demonstrations showed that swallows could exhibit homing behavior and that when they did so they flew much faster than homing pigeons. [...] Desbouvrie also succeeded in curbing the birds' natural migratory behavior. [...] After obtaining authorization from the government <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> testing, Desbouvrie delayed and did not follow through with rigorous experimentation.|$|E
500|$|However {{the bundle}} {{as well as}} the video was not {{released}} in December; Gaga later released a statement in her social networking website Little Monsters that the video was delayed since the singer was given just one week to plan and complete it, like the video for [...] "Applause".

The video remained unreleased despite Gaga releasing the official video <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> single, [...] "G.U.Y." [...] On June 19, 2014, celebrity news website TMZ published previously unseen footage from the video showing sexually suggestive scenes. In one of them, Kelly, playing a doctor, reaches under a sheet covering a naked Gaga, causing her to moan. In another scene, Richardson appeared to be photographing Gaga as she writhes on newspapers. According to the TMZ report, the video was cancelled possibly due to weariness and fear of backlash for Kelly's past trial on child pornography, as well as sexual harassment claims by several models who had previously worked with Richardson.|$|E
