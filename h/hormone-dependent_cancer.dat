Hormones such as estrogen and IGFI are shown to increase pioneer factor concentration leading {{to a change in}} transcription. [...] Known pioneer factors such as FoxA1, PBX1, TLE, AP2, GATA factors 2/3/4, and PU.1 have been associated with <b>hormone-dependent</b> <b>cancer</b> [...] FoxA1 is necessary for estrogen and androgen mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and is a defining gene for ER+ luminal breast cancer, as is another pioneer factor GATA3. [...] FOXA1 particularly is expressed in 90% of breast cancer metastases and 89% of metastic prostate cancers. [...] In the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, it was found that FoxA1 was bound to 50% of estrogen receptor binding sites independent of estrogen presence. High expression of pioneer factors is associated with poor prognosis with the exception of breast cancer where FoxA1 is associated with a stronger outcome.|$|E

In addition, results from in vitro studies show that Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, OVCAR- 3 ovarian cancer cells, and LNCaP prostate cancer cells all possess significant STS activity. Furthermore, STS activity in these cells can be almost completely inhibited by STX 64 or the second-generation STS inhibitor, STX 213.
