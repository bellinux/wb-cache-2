40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) power systems, {{like other}} {{electrical}} systems, {{may be subject}} to unexpected ground faults. Installed PV systems always have invisible elements other than those indicated by their electrical schematics. Stray inductance, capacitance and resistance are distributed throughout the system. Leakage currents associated with the PV modules, the interconnected array, wires, surge protection devices and conduit add up and can become large enough to look like a <b>ground-fault.</b> PV systems are frequently connected to other sources of power or energy storage such as batteries, standby generators, and the utility grid.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, the {{petroleum}} and chemical industry has found increasing favor with 60 -Hz low-voltage (600 Vac) power systems that utilize a high-resistance grounded (HRG) neutral philosophy. Historically, {{the older generation}} of ad-justable-speed drives (ASDs) {{had little or no}} effect on the normal operation of <b>ground-fault</b> indicators (GFIs) used with the installed HRG systems. This paper focuses its investigation into nuisance GFI alarms that may occur when present-generation ASDs are retrofitted into the existing plant. The paper first reviews possible neutral grounding systems, with emphasis on the types of HRG systems possible and GFI alarm philosophy. The paper then dis-cusses how ASDs may generate zero-sequence high-frequency noise currents in the HRG neutral circuit, which may cause nuisance <b>ground-fault</b> alarms and potentially mask a legitimate ground fault. GFI noise current magnitude is defined for both present and older ASD technologies (e. g., insulated gate bipolar transistor versus bipolar junction transistor drives). The effect this transient zero-sequence noise current magnitude has on GFI operation is described. Mitigation methods used at the drive to reduce ASD noise current magnitude to acceptable nonalarm levels is investigated. Filter solutions located at the HRG/GFI meter that reduce nuisance alarms are also investigated. The pros and cons of at the drive or at the meter filter solutions are supported with laboratory and field test data. Application guidelines are given to help avoid nuisance problems with a plant <b>ground-fault</b> protection scheme, which needs to successfully operate in the presence of multiple ASDs.

40|$|Many {{high-impedance}} ground faults (HIGFs) {{that happen}} in low-voltage (LV) systems often cause customer supply loss, fire, and human safety hazards. Traditional <b>ground-fault</b> protection {{is provided by the}} residual current circuit breaker (RCCB). The RCCB is usually employed in an analogue measuring circuit and often causes nuisance tripping due to capacitive leakage current and load-switching operations.

In this paper active power variation-based protection for HIGFs is developed, and a dissipation factor (DF) -based criterion for identifying load-switching operation is proposed. They are implemented by cross-correlation analysis between phase voltage and residual current in single-phase networks. A digital protection scheme is also designed.

40|$|IEC Standard 61936 - 1 "Power {{installations}} exceeding 1 kV a. c. " {{defines the}} "Global Grounding System" (GGS). It consists essentially in the interconnection of the MV/LV grounding systems, generally {{at least by}} means of the MV cables metal sheaths and/or of dedicated ground conductors buried along the MV cable lines. The interconnection of grounding systems involves a significant reduction of the apparent grounding resistance at the MV/LV substations, by creating a metallic <b>ground-fault</b> current path in parallel with the ground which drains away most of the fault current. Due to the mentioned ground resistance reduction, the IEC 61936 - 1 allows to adopt simplified, relaxed design criteria for the individual grounding systems. The paper suggests recognizing the four "globality" levels of grounding systems in a common zone of influence.

40|$|Transformer {{terminal}} equivalents obtained via admittance {{measurements are}} suitable for simulating high-frequency transient interaction between the transformer and the network. This paper augments the terminal equivalent approach with a measurement-based voltage transfer function model which permits calculation of voltages at internal points in the regulating winding. The approach is demonstrated for a single-phase three-winding transformer in tap position Nom+ with inclusion of three internal points in the regulating winding that represent the mid-point and the two extreme ends. The terminal equivalent modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding. The final model is used in a time domain simulation where <b>ground-fault</b> initiation results in a resonant voltage build-up in the winding. It is shown that that the peak value of the resonant overvoltage can be higher than during the lightning impulse test, with unfavorable network conditions. Additional measurements show that the selected tap position affects the terminal behavior of the transformer, changing the frequency and peak value of the lower resonance point in the voltage transfer between windings.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{study of}} grounding systems is only possible for basic electrodes, i. e., hemispherical and spherical electrodes, rods, and horizontal wires. However, it is normal practice to employ more complex earthing systems, such as grounding grids integrated with rods, {{in order to}} obtain lower resistances to ground and improve the electrical safety of substations. This paper introduces a semianalytical (or seminumerical) method, consisting of an analytical approach integrated with a numerical solution, to study grounding grids of complex geometry and their effects on non stratified soils. The algorithm that was created and realized with MATLAB allows the determination of all the quantities of interest for the design and the analysis of such grounding systems, i. e., ground resistance, ground potentials, and distribution of the <b>ground-fault</b> current along the grid's components (i. e., horizontal wires and rods). The model {{is based on the assumption}} that conductors forming grids have very small radii if compared with their lengths and that the wires can be considered equipotential cylindrical elements.

40|$|Distributed {{temperature}} sensing (DTS) is a fiber-optical method enabling simultaneous {{temperature measurements}} over long distances. Electrical resistance heating of the metallic {{components of the}} fiber-optic cable provides information on the thermal characteristics of the cable's environment, providing valuable insight into processes occurring in the surrounding medium, such as groundwater–surface water interactions, dam stability or soil moisture. Until now, heated applications required direct handling of the DTS instrument by a researcher, rendering long-term investigations in remote areas impractical due to the often difficult and time-consuming access to the field site. Remote control and automation of the DTS instrument and heating processes, however, resolve the issue with difficult access. The data can also be remotely accessed and stored on a central database. The power supply can be grid independent, although significant infrastructure investment is required here due to high power consumption during heated applications. Solar energy must be sufficient even in worst case scenarios, e. g. during long periods of intense cloud cover, to prevent system failure due to energy shortage. In combination with storage batteries and a low heating frequency, e. g. once per day or once per week (depending on the season and the solar radiation on site), issues of high power consumption may be resolved.
