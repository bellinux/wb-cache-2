25|$|During the Florida land {{boom of the}} 1920s, {{real estate}} sales took off as Americans {{discovered}} their automobiles and the paved Dixie Highway, which through no coincidence led {{to the foot of}} the Collins Bridge. There were less than 1,000year-round residents of Miami Beach in 1920. In the next five years, the resident population of the Miami Beach area grew 440%. People from all over the country flocked to South Florida in hopes of <b>getting</b> <b>rich</b> buying and selling real estate. They sent home tales of riches being made when orange groves and swamp lands were subdivided, sold, and developed.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, Milton Bradley {{developed}} {{a radically different}} concept of success in The Checkered Game of Life, the first American board game rewarding players for worldly ventures such as attending college, being elected to Congress, and <b>getting</b> <b>rich.</b> Virtue became {{a means to an}} end rather than an end in itself. [...] Daily life was the focus of the game with secular virtues such as thrift, ambition, and neatness receiving more emphasis than religious virtues. Indeed, the only suggestion of religion in Bradley's game was the marriage altar. [...] The Checkered Game of Life was wildly popular, selling 40,000 copies in its first year.|$|E

2500|$|The New Thought book The Science of <b>Getting</b> <b>Rich</b> by Wallace Wattles, {{the source}} Rhonda Byrne cites as {{inspiration}} for the film, was preceded by numerous other New Thought books, including the 1906 book Thought Vibration or the law of attraction in the Thought World by William Walker Atkinson, editor of New Thought magazine.

2500|$|Byrne's {{inspiration}} for creating The Secret came from reading the 1910 book The Science of <b>Getting</b> <b>Rich</b> by Wallace D. Wattles.

Rainone became the CEO of one of Byrne's companies, The Secret LLC, and is described by Byrne as [...] "delivered to us from heaven".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{or because}} of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign [...] "settlers" [...] were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of <b>getting</b> <b>rich</b> quickly. A classic gold rush had been set off that would have tragic {{consequences}} for the Caribbean's indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the Black Legend). Columbus allowed settlers {{to return to their}} homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the general preferential attachment function and author fitness, which describe the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> and fit <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> phenomena, in the co-authorship and citation networks of the strategic management scientific community. This has been done by means of the PAFit method using the community's flagship journal, namely Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest the co-authorship and citation temporal networks are governed by both the fit <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> and the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> processes. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-author network is 0. 3 while it is 0. 29 in the citation network, which suggests the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> phenomenon is similarly weak in both networks. On the other hand, the distributions of author fitness in both networks have long right tail, which implies that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author plays a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Furthermore, author fitness in both co-authorship and citation networks are found to be consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community. Comment: 21 Page...|$|R

2500|$|At a {{time when}} teams {{literally}} owned their players for their entire careers, the players began demanding such basics as a minimum salary and a properly funded pension plan. While team owners were <b>getting</b> <b>rich</b> with sold out arenas game after game, players were earning a pittance and many needed summer jobs to make a living. Almost all of these men had {{no more than a}} high school education and had been playing hockey as a profession all their working life. Superstars in the 1950s earned less than $25,000 a year ($ in [...] dollars) and when their playing days were over, they had nothing to fall back on and had to accept whatever work they could get in order to survive.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Eileen said several of Ford's models from the 1950s and 1960s {{had died from}} smoking and breast cancer. Some 1970s models died from drug use, {{including}} Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS in 1986. Top fashion photographers, tired of these models' behavior, refused {{to work with them}} any longer. In 1981, the Fords began an international modeling competition called [...] "Face of the 80s", later known as Ford Models Supermodel of the World. By the mid-1980s, drug-addicted blonde models were out, and more professional, brunette-haired models such as Cindy Crawford, Renée Simonsen, Carol Alt, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington came on the scene. As a result, modeling fees rapidly accelerated and several models were making millions of dollars per year. Fashion editor Polly Mellen said, [...] "The girls are <b>getting</b> <b>rich,</b> so rich." [...] Turlington, at the age of 16, moved into Ford's townhouse during the summer of 1985, and would rapidly become one of the Ford's biggest successes ever.|$|E

2500|$|Philippide made {{a trip to}} Western Europe in 1914, {{after which}} he {{remained}} in Iași {{for the rest of}} his days. Like many educated Moldavians, he expressed distaste for Bucharest, considering it the root of all evil. He derided the Romanian Parliament as a gathering of [...] "wretched undertakers", and railed against the Romanian Academy, which he saw as a hastily improvised imitation of prestigious Western academies, rife with imposture and improvisation, its members concerned with <b>getting</b> <b>rich</b> quickly rather than finding comfort in the rewards of philosophy. Philippide, in common with other Junimists, deplored the French influence on Romania, believing the country needed a Germanic touch for its betterment. He was proud to live far from the hustle and bustle of Bucharest, hoping to revive the Junimea-era glories of the country's former cultural capital that he inhabited. To this end, he helped bring a superior class of students, professors, writers and artists to Iași.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Thomas began writing and {{performing}} his own songs. He regarded Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Gatemouth Moore as musical influences. He made his professional singing debut at the Elks Club on Beale Street, {{filling in for}} another singer at the last minute, and during the 1940s became a regular performer in Memphis nightclubs, such as Currie`s Club Tropicana. As an established performer in Memphis, aged 33 in 1950, Thomas recorded his first 78 rpm single, for Jesse Erickson's small Star Talent label in Dallas, Texas. Thomas said, [...] "I {{just wanted to make}} a record. I never thought of <b>getting</b> <b>rich.</b> I just wanted to be known, be a recording artist.... the record sold five copies and I bought four of them." [...] The record, [...] "I'll Be a Good Boy" [...] backed with [...] "I'm So Worried", gained a Billboard review, which stated that [...] "Thomas shows first class style on a slow blues". [...] He also recorded for the Bullet label in Nashville, Tennessee, when he recorded with Bobby Plater's Orchestra and was credited as [...] "Mr. Swing"; the recordings were not recognised by researchers as being by Thomas until 1996. [...] In 1951 he made his first recordings at Sam Phillips's Sun Studio, for the Chess label, but they were not commercially successful.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1943, Papen {{scored a}} great coup when he {{reported}} to Berlin that the German embassy had been contacted by Elyesa Bazna, the Albanian valet to Knatchbull-Hugessen, Britain's ambassador to Turkey: [...] Banza had {{gained access to}} the safe which contained the most important documents in the British Embassy, {{and he wanted to}} sell them to the Germans. On 7 November 1943, Papen flew to Berlin to tell Hitler personally that due to Bazna, better known by his codename [...] "Cicero", that he now had a very valuable spy working for him as everything that Knatchbull-Hugessen knew he now knew. By December 1943 Papen was faced with the dilemma about how to best act on Bazna's information without triggering British suspicions that there was a spy in their embassy in Ankara. Unknown to Bazna, the Germans paid him with counterfeit British pounds (which ended Bazna's dreams of <b>getting</b> <b>rich,</b> causing him to die in poverty). Papen noted that Bazna that was an extremely greedy and stupid man with no moral values whatsoever, and {{there was nothing wrong with}} paying him with counterfeit pounds. Bazna sold Papen a summary of the results of Tehran conference, which Papen in turn provided selective quotes from to Inönü together with the misleading statement that Britain and the United States had just assigned Turkey to the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, which strained Turkish relations with the Allies.|$|E
