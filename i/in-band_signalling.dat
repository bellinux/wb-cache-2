50|$|In telecommunications, <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{the sending}} of control {{information}} {{within the same}} band or channel used for voice or video.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control mechanism for zero-cell-loss handoff in wireless ATM networks. Since the path re-routing process in handoff control causes the incompletion {{of the connection}} path during a transition period, a cell level scheduling mechanism has {{to be applied to}} avoid data loss. In this paper, we first describe the basic requirements at the cell level scheduler of ATM devices (ATM switches and ATM NIC cards). We show that a dynamic buffering and transmission control should be supported through <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> with OAM cells. Then we propose a <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism with an End-ofstream (EOS) OAM cell and a Start-of-stream (SOS) OAM cell to perform zero-cell-loss control at cell level. Finally, by combining the <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> and ATM UNI/NNI outband signaling in right sequence, we {{presents a}} protocol design of handoff control which has no cell loss, duplication or misordering.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to combine two MFSK systems to increase the throughput of the link.

50|$|Canada {{formerly}} used a US-style ACTS {{coin phone}} {{system with a}} tone pair which would beep once for a nickel, twice for a dime and five times on receiving a quarter. These phones did not accept $1 coins (or the later $2 coin) and disappeared with the roll-out of Nortel Millennium payphones in the 1990s. The Millennium sets do not use ACTS <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> tones as all coin-handling is automated in the phone itself.|$|E
50|$|Many {{companies}} {{are involved with}} telematics technology to use in different aspects of eCall including in-vehicle systems, wireless data delivery, and public safety answering point systems.

Prototypes have been successfully tested with GPRS and <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> over cellular networks. At the same time proprietary eCall solutions that rely on SMS exist already today from car makers such as BMW, PSA and Volvo Cars. Once in active deployment, other telematic services such as route advisories and traffic information are expected to explode.|$|E
50|$|<b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{applies only}} to {{channel-associated}} signaling (CAS). In common channel signaling (CCS) separate channels are used for control and data, {{as opposed to the}} shared channel in CAS, so all control is out-of-band by definition.|$|R
50|$|When dialing from a {{land-line}} telephone, {{the telephone}} number is encoded and transmitted across the telephone line {{in form of}} dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF). The tones control the telephone system by instructing the telephone switch where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same channel, the copper wire, and in the frequency range (300 Hz to 3.4 kHz) as the audio of the telephone call. <b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is also used on older telephone carrier systems to provide inter-exchange information for routing calls. Examples {{of this kind of}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> system are the Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) and R2 signalling.|$|R

5000|$|The J-CAT also {{supported}} another non-standard feature that allowed direct {{control of the}} phone line. Instead of using <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling,</b> like the Smartmodem, the J-CAT passed the on/off-hook control, carrier detect and phone status indication to the computer through otherwise unused pins in the RS-232C connector. The computer could pulse the hook line to simulate pulse dialing or hang up, and read the status pin to look for line signals like ringing or busy (any noise on the line was reported as [...] "1"). Using these features required a computer able to signal on spare pins, often requiring a second connector and a custom cable to support it. Combined with proper software this made the J-CAT fairly [...] "smart", although Novation was careful to state {{it was not a}} [...] "smart modem". Operation was generally similar to the APPLE-CAT in concept. Interestingly, the J-CAT was released after the Smartmodem 300, so, unsurprisingly, it was never very popular even though it was fairly low-cost (for the era).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Basis of {{cognitive}} radio is to exploit unused frequency channels in licensed band. Recently standardised IEEE 802. 22 set {{of cognitive}} radio protocols envisages fixed and nomadic receivers at below 800 MHz bands. Radio link design for this cognitive radio {{consider that the}} channels are available only dynamically to secondary users. Scanning period is thus embedded in link layer control as overhead and reduces overall efficiency of cognitive radio technology. For mobile receivers, availability of permanent channels for radio link control is essential for <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling.</b> Existing mobile communication system uses CDMA 800, GSM 900, GSM 1800 and WCDMA 2000 MHz bands for which approximately 1 / 8 t...|$|E

SIR is evolved from an access protocol (PRMA++) studied {{within the framework of the}} TDMA-based version of the European evolving standard for third generation mobile systems. In particular, SIR uses the same frame structure and <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> but introduces a contention-free handling of data bandwidth requests while meeting speech service requirements via basic PRMA++ mechanisms. 1...|$|E
50|$|A {{blue box}} is an {{electronic}} device that simulated an operator by generating the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to, for example, switch long-distance calls. A blue box {{is a tool}} {{that emerged in the}} 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box, enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems do not use <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling or CCIS.|$|R
50|$|In {{the public}} {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN), <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{the exchange of}} call control information within the same channel that the telephone call itself is using.

40|$|For {{increased}} bandwidth {{savings in}} packet networks, speech compression algorithms {{are applied to}} reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to adequately reconstruct a telephone signal at the receiver. However, such algorithms do not process pure tones (such as dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF)) with high fidelity, hence such <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> tones must be detected before packetization occurs. To minimise the amount of DTMF tone distortion, and detect valid tones which may contain impairments, the tone recognition algorithm needs to decode tone-pairs in as short a time as possible. Many existing systems already use the Goertzel algorithm for DTMF tone detection. This paper presents a modification to the algorithm which allows an effective increase in detection frequency by overlapping, without the need for reprocessing of input data...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a common control channel {{is one of the}} most challenging issues in cognitive radio networks, since a fully reliable control channel cannot be created without reserving bandwidth specifically for this purpose. In this paper, we investigate a promising solution that exploits the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology to let cognitive radio nodes discover each other and exchange control information for establishing a communication link. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) we define the communication protocol needed to let cognitive radio nodes discover each other and exchange control information for link set up, (ii) we overcome the gap in coverage, which typically exists between UWB and long-medium range technolo- gies, by using multi-hop communication, (iii) we evaluate the performance of our approach by adopting an accurate channel model and show its benefits with respect to an <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> solutio...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of transmission holding time data based from two different Public Access Mobile Radio (PAMR) is presented. The data are obtained from digitised conversations by automatically identifying the spectrum of the <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> that limits every transmission. It is shown how the empirical histogram {{is far from being}} exponential, which is the type most used in teletraffic issues. From the different theoretic distribution models adjusted to the transmission times a mixture of lognormals is the best fit. As transmission trunking needs far more signalling and the Grade of Service (GoS) is more crucial than when trunking by message, a careful choice of the distribution model is strongly recommended. The best fit distribution can be used to feed computer simulations in order to obtain accurate measurements of system performance. 1.
