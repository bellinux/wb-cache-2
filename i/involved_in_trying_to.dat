5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{diagnostic}} {{instrument to}} identify the competencies in research knowledge and skills of doctoral student was developed. There {{is a need to}} measure student deficiencies in their preparation to conduct doctoral research in order to provide guidance and training. A four stage development of the instrument was conducted. Firstly, through a literature review on the construct in research knowledge and skills were identified and then defined operationally. Items for the instrument were 5 point Likert-type and were either adapted from similar existing instrument or developed by the researcher. Through a pilot study the instruments was validated by peer evaluation and its reliability was measured using internal consistency method. The process also involved item analysis to weed out weak items. The final stage <b>involve</b> <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gauge a sample of the current PhD candidates competencies in research.

On April 9, 1989, the army, together with MVD units, killed 20 demonstrators in Tbilisi in Georgia.

At around the same time, there were intelligence reports that Russian hackers were trying to obtain Clinton's emails to pass to Flynn through an unnamed intermediary. Five of the hacker groups Smith contacted, including at least two Russian groups, claimed to have the emails. He was shown some information but was not convinced it was genuine, and suggested the hackers give it to Wikileaks instead.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} two weeks after the initial landing on 15 September 1944, the {{regiment}} took part in the Battle of Peleliu under Colonel William H. Harrison. All artillery support was handled both novelly and conventionally, providing massed preparatory, harassing, and interdicting fire. Later, the artillery was used to fire directly into the mouths of enemy caves. In March 1945, the 11th Marines participated in the Battle of Okinawa, its final combat operation of World War II. There the regiment played an important defensive role with effective counter-battery fire, and steadily suppressed enemy attempts to counter-attack objectives already won by U.S. forces. With the war won, in the fall of 1945 the 11th Marines moved to Tianjin in North China where it was soon <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> keep peace {{in the midst of the}} increasing conflict between rival Chinese factions. Early in 1947, the regiment returned to the United States to be reduced virtually to a battalion-sized unit.|$|E
25|$|From around 1985 to 1991, the {{new leader}} of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev {{attempted}} to reduce the strain the Army placed on economic demands. His government slowly reduced {{the size of the}} army. By 1989 Soviet troops had completely left their Warsaw Pact neighbors to fend for themselves. That same year Soviet forces left Afghanistan. By the end of 1990, the entire Eastern Bloc had collapsed in the wake of democratic revolutions. As a result, Soviet citizens quickly began to turn against the Communist government as well. As the Soviet Union moved towards disintegration, the reduced military was rendered feeble and ineffective and could no longer prop up the ailing Soviet government. The military got <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> suppress conflicts and unrest in the Caucasus and central Asia, but it often proved incapable of restoring peace and order. On April 9, 1989, the army, together with MVD units, massacred about 190 demonstrators in Tbilisi in Georgia. The next major crisis occurred in Azerbaijan, when the Soviet army forcibly entered Baku on January 19–20, 1990, removing the rebellious republic government and allegedly killing hundreds of civilians in the process. On January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the State Radio and Television Building and the television retranslation tower in Vilnius, Lithuania, both under opposition control, killing 14 people and injuring 700.

It suggests that insisting on ‘peace without annexations and indemnities on the basis of self-determination of nations’ was not realistic given Russia’s war exhaustion and the war aims of the other belligerents. However, it also shows that no other peace aim had any political support within Russia...|$|R

The same week, Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, former commander-in-chief of NATO's Forces in Northern Europe from 1979 to 1982, declared to The Guardian that a secret arms network was established in Britain after the war.

This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I have offered to make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority.
