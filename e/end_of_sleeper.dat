In {{order to improve}} the prediction accuracy of the ballast settlements in the ballasted track, a series of cyclic loading tests were performed to be focused attention {{on the condition of}} minimum load and the shape of sleeper in the various design condition. It was found that the settlement of railway ballast increased to be supported at the central part of sleeper for the ballasted track on the standard rigid roadbed when the small void became to be grown between the bottom surface of sleeper and upper surface of railway ballast around the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleeper</b> by the cyclic loading...|$|E

5000|$|Electrification {{extends from}} Oulu northwards to Rovaniemi, {{and as of}} 2013 is being {{extended}} north to Kemijärvi. [...] In 2006, direct sleeper services were discontinued beyond Rovaniemi (to Kemijärvi) because the new double-deck sleeping carriages were unable to operate with diesel haulage. The sleeper service to Kemijärvi was restarted in March 2008, by adding to the train in Rovaniemi a new diesel generator car supplying 1,500 V electricity for the sleeper cars between Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi; this setup will continue in use until the electrification extension to Kemijärvi is completed at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2013. <b>Sleeper</b> services between Turku and Joensuu and Helsinki and Kajaani were withdrawn in 2006, but with the new direct line between Lahti and Kerava, the daytime services were made quicker.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{increased}} {{speed and}} weight of modern trains puts the components of a railway track in a highly dynamic load situation. Irregularities of the wheels and rails induce substantial dynamic loads {{that have to be}} accounted for in the procedure of designing the railway track. The concrete sleeper {{is an essential part of}} the track structure and there is a growing demand for improved analytical tools for concrete sleepers under dynamic loading. A typical finite element model <b>of</b> the concrete <b>sleeper</b> is established that focuses on analyzing the behavior <b>of</b> a concrete <b>sleeper</b> during a train passage. A finite element model of a pre-stressed concrete sleeper is established for static load conditions. The studies done with the sleeper model showed that the train load has great impact at the rail seat positions at the two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> maintained at broad gauge distance i. e. 1. 76 m. The natural frequencies obtained for a sleeper in free-free condition are lesser compared to the natural frequencies obtained for sleeper in-situ condition. The analysis also showed that the interaction between the sleeper and the underlying ballast is of great importance for the dynamic behavior <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper...</b>|$|R
50|$|The sleepers, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} bi-bloc sleepers, are U41 twin block reinforced concrete, 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in.) wide, and weigh 245 kg (540 lb) each. They {{are equipped with}} hardware for Nabla RNTC spring fasteners, and a 9 mm (3/8 in.) rubber pad. (Rubber pads are always used under the rail on concrete sleepers, to avoid cracking). Next, a rail threader is used to lift the rails onto their final position on the sleepers. This machine rides on the rails just like the gantry cranes, but can also support itself directly on a sleeper. By doing this, it can lift the rails, and shift them inwards over the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sleepers,</b> to the proper gauge (standard gauge). It then lowers them onto the rubber sleeper cushions, and workers use a pneumatically operated machine to bolt down the Nabla clips with a predetermined torque. The rails are canted inward at a slope of 1 in 20.|$|R
2500|$|If not restrained, rails would {{lengthen}} in {{hot weather}} and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving {{in relation to the}} <b>sleeper</b> by use <b>of</b> clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sleepers,</b> to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the rail by special clips that resist longitudinal movement of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how long a welded rail can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted {{in hot weather}} and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as sun kink, and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic. In North American practice extreme temperature conditions will trigger slow orders to allow for crews to react to buckling or [...] "sun kinks" [...] if encountered.|$|R
40|$|Pre-assembled {{turnouts}} {{have recently}} been introduced with split concrete sleepers joined by elastic coupling plates. Their effect on the forces, vibration response, and sound radiation as trains run through a turnout is studied here using a calculation model for a whole turnout based on the finite-element method. The non-linear characteristics of the ballast's support under the sleepers, {{as well as the}} special construction of the articulated joints, are included. It is shown that compared with the normal integral sleeper design, the track with articulated switch sleepers has a lower rigidity, which changes more evenly along the track and improves its dynamic performance. Furthermore, the fatigue strength of an articulated switch sleeper is higher due to its lower stress amplitudes. Additionally, when the vehicles are running on the main turnout route, as the switch sleepers’ vibration behaviour is modified, the articulated joints effectively reduce the impact loading of the ballast at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> under the turnout branch track. This will extend the life of the ballast bed. Finally, the sound radiation from the articulated switch sleeper is very low in the hinged short part and is reduced by about 0. 6 dB for the total length. <br/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers,</b> rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> In view <b>of</b> the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types <b>of</b> concrete <b>sleepers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the pullout tests revealed the effects <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> is proposed...|$|R
