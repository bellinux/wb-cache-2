5|$|Shackleford was foaled on February 25, 2008. He {{was named}} after Shackleford Banks, a barrier island system in North Carolina, home to a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> feral Banker horses and a place often visited by his owners.|$|E

5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> black cattle. Subsequently the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. This {{has led to a}} regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the HT Ranch, {{located near}} Medora, North Dakota, bought 60 mares from a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> 250 Native American-bred horses {{originally}} confiscated from the Lakota leader Sitting Bull and sold at Fort Buford, North Dakota in 1881. Some of these mares were bred to the Thoroughbred racing stallion Lexington, also {{owned by the}} HT Ranch.|$|E

30|$|Male-headed {{households}} {{are more likely}} to keep larger <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> livestock, whereas household heads with higher level of education {{are more likely to}} keep smaller herd sizes. Also, households with bigger family sizes and those that have inherited livestock are more likely to own larger <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> livestock. However, generation of income outside livestock rearing by the pastoralists leads to the keeping <b>of</b> smaller <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> animals. The intensity and frequency of cattle rustling inversely affects the <b>herd</b> size <b>of</b> pastoralists. Droughts and diseases often lead to loss of livestock, thus reducing herd size, and therefore influence the decision to migrate so as to avoid loss of animals.|$|R
50|$|Reindeer, {{upon which}} the local {{inhabitants}} subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers, but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992. As <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> domestic reindeer have declined, <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> wild caribou have increased.|$|R
5|$|Near Wood River, Nebraska, a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> bison {{caused the}} Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull {{all of the}} wagons, each {{handcart}} was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit around the Itcha Range. Among them are cougars, wolves, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, mule deers, {{mountain}} goats, beavers, coyotes, red foxes, muskrats, martens, river otters, lynx and wolverines. Also present {{is the largest}} <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> woodland caribou in southern British Columbia, {{as well as the}} most northerly population of California bighorn sheep in North America.|$|E
5|$|A <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> elk was {{introduced}} to the watershed shortly before November 2000. Black bears have also been observed in the watershed. Coyotes live in the watershed, and have been hunted and trapped. Other mammals living in the watershed include gray squirrels, beavers, minks, bobcats, raccoons, and red and gray foxes. The Allegheny Wood Rat has the potential to inhabit much of the watershed except for the northwestern part.|$|E
50|$|They live in <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> up to 20 and {{are usually}} led by a single female. These <b>herds</b> {{generally}} consist <b>of</b> cows and calves, but have bulls during the dry season. Older males form bachelor herds. Many herds are known to break up and rejoin as they travel and {{have been found to}} be mixed in with <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> banteng or wild buffalo.|$|R

50|$|The plateau {{supports}} large <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain Elk (Cervus canadensis), and Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana).

From there, {{the interior of the}} cathedral starts to disappear and move but then focuses on a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> houses running through a vast corn field. The video ends with Utada stretching her arms against the sunlight, as the camera zooms away from her via bird's eye view, all shot by a toy airplane which was controlled by the director of the video.|$|E
5|$|In Kentucky, {{a family}} watches in {{confusion}} as a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> cattle starts running past their home, on fire. A spaceship explodes before it returns to Mars, {{and hundreds of}} other Martian ships leave Mars and head towards Earth. President James Dale, along with his aides, addresses the United States concerning the historic event. The President's science aides set up a first contact meeting with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada as President Dale watches the development on TV with his wife Marsha and his daughter Taffy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the domesticated ponies {{there is a small}} <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle. These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in the 1970s to form a nature reserve. Today the island is owned by the Samye Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health. They operate a policy of non-intervention, allowing the ponies to live without human interference.|$|E

5|$|In the book's opening, {{the title}} {{character}} and her mate ambush a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> Astrodon, which are large herbivorous sauropods. The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{has several}} sites {{administered}} by the National Park Service. Two national parks have been established in South Dakota, both in the state's southwestern part. Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, has an extensive cave network {{as well as a}} large <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> bison. Badlands National Park was created in 1978. The park features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi-arid grasslands. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's culture {{reflects}} the state's American Indian, rural, Western, and European roots. A number of annual events celebrating the state's ethnic and historical heritage take place around the state, such as Days of '76 in Deadwood, Czech Days in Tabor, {{and the annual}} St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo festivities in Sioux Falls. The various tribes hold many annual pow wows at their reservations throughout the state, to which non-Native Americans are sometimes invited. Custer State Park holds an annual Buffalo Roundup, in which volunteers on horseback gather the park's <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> around 1,500 bison.|$|E

5|$|The {{next big}} {{headland}} is Foreland Point, {{after which the}} path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.|$|E

50|$|Feedlot bison in North America not {{in contact}} with sheep have also been {{diagnosed}} with a form of BMCF. OHV-2 has been recently documented to infect <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> up to 5 km away from the nearest lambs, with the levels of infected animals proportional to the distance away from the closest <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> sheep.|$|R
50|$|Hunting of wild bison {{is legal}} {{in some states}} and provinces where public herds require culling to {{maintain}} a target population.
