50|$|<b>Fenobam</b> has {{anxiolytic}} effects {{comparable to}} those of benzodiazepine drugs, but was never commercially marketed for the treatment of anxiety due to dose-limiting side effects such as amnesia and psychotomimetic symptoms. Following the discovery of its activity as a potent negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5, <b>fenobam</b> has been re-investigated for many applications, with its profile of combined antidepressant, anxiolytic, analgesic and anti-addictive effects potentially useful given the common co-morbidity of these symptoms. It has also shown promising initial results in the treatment of fragile X syndrome. It was developed by a team at McNeil Laboratories in the 1970s.|$|E

Evidence from mouse models shows that mGluR5 antagonists (blockers) can rescue dendritic spine abnormalities and seizures, as well as cognitive and behavioral problems, and may show promise in the treatment of FXS. Two new drugs, AFQ-056 (mavoglurant) and dipraglurant, as well as the repurposed drug <b>fenobam</b> are currently undergoing human trials for the treatment of FXS.

40|$|International audienceAmantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate {{glutamate}} receptor antagonist, {{is currently}} the only pharmacological treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD), but causes adverse effects on {{the central nervous system}} at therapeutic doses. <b>Fenobam,</b> a negative modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5, has recently been reported to attenuate LID in MPTP-treated macaques. The aim of the current study was to investigate the treatment interactions of <b>fenobam</b> and amantadine on LID in the MPTP-treated macaque model of PD. The antidyskinetic and -parkinsonian effects were measured after administration of <b>fenobam</b> (10 - 30 mg/kg) and amantadine (10 - 30 mg/kg) alone and in combination. <b>Fenobam</b> (30 mg/kg) and amantadine (30 mg/kg) alone reduced LID, whereas lower doses of either drug did not cause any significant effects. A combined treatment of <b>fenobam</b> and amantadine at subthreshold doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) significantly reduced LID without worsening PD disability. These data suggest that a low-dose combination of <b>fenobam</b> and amantadine can be used for alleviating dyskinesia without causing adverse motor effects. Such combined therapies may offer a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of LID in PD patients...|$|E
40|$|L-DOPA {{remains the}} gold-standard {{treatment}} for Parkinson's disease but causes motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR 5) {{has been proposed}} as a target for antidyskinetic therapies. Here, we evaluate the effects of <b>fenobam,</b> a noncompetitive mGluR 5 antagonist already tested in humans, using rodent and nonhuman primate models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In both animal models, acute administration of <b>fenobam</b> attenuated the L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements (50 - 70 % reduction at the doses of 30 mg/kg in rats and 10 mg/kg in monkeys). The effect consisted in a reduction of peak-dose dyskinesia, whereas the end-dose phase was not affected. Chronic administration of <b>fenobam</b> to previously drug-naïve animals (de novo treatment) attenuated the development of peak-dose dyskinesia without compromising the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA. In addition, <b>fenobam</b> prolonged the motor stimulant effect of L-DOPA.

40|$|Metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor subtype 5 (mGlu 5) {{has been}} demonstrated {{to play a role}} in the modulation of numerous nociceptive modalities. When administered via peripheral, intrathecal, or systemic routes, mGlu 5 antagonists have analgesic properties in a variety of preclinical pain models. Despite a wealth of data supporting the use of mGlu 5 antagonists to treat pain, studies have been limited to preclinical animal models due to a lack of mGlu 5 antagonists that are approved for use in humans. It {{has been demonstrated}} previously that <b>fenobam</b> [N-(3 -chlorophenyl) -N′-(4, 5 -dihydro- 1 -methyl- 4 -oxo- 1 H-imidazole- 2 -yl) urea], an anxiolytic shown to be safe and effective in human trials, is a selective and potent noncompetitive antagonist of mGlu 5 (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 315 : 711 – 721, 2005). Here, we report a series of studies aimed at testing whether <b>fenobam,</b> similar to the prototypical mGlu 5 antagonist 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine (MPEP), has analgesic properties in mice. We show that <b>fenobam</b> reduces formalin-induced pain behaviors and relieves established inflammation-induced thermal hypersensitivity in mice. Similar results were seen with MPEP. Administration of <b>fenobam</b> resulted in an increase in locomotor activity in the open-field task but did not impair performance on the accelerating Rotarod. Analysis of brain and plasma <b>fenobam</b> levels indicated that <b>fenobam</b> is rapidly concentrated in brain after intraperitoneal administration in mice but is essentially cleared from circulation within 1 h after injection. <b>Fenobam</b> had no analgesic effect in mGlu 5 knockout mice, whereas the prototypical antagonist MPEP retained significant analgesic efficacy in mGlu 5 knockouts.

40|$|Objective: A pilot open label, {{single dose}} trial of <b>fenobam,</b> an mGluR 5 antagonist, was {{conducted}} to provide an initial evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetics in adult males and females with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Methods: Twelve subjects, recruited from two fragile X clinics, received a single oral dose of 50 - 150 mg of <b>fenobam.</b> Blood for pharmacokinetic testing, vital signs and side effect screening was obtained at baseline and numerous time points for 6 h after dosing. Outcome measures included prepulse inhibition (PPI) and a continuous performance test (CPT) obtained before and after dosing to explore the effects of <b>fenobam</b> on core phenotypic measures of sensory gating, attention and inhibition. Results: There were no significant adverse reactions to <b>fenobam</b> administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that <b>fenobam</b> concentrations were dose dependent but variable, with mean (SEM) peak values of 39. 7 (18. 4) ng/ml at 180 min after the 150 mg dose. PPI met a response criterion of an improvement of at least 20 % over baseline in 6 of 12 individuals (4 / 6 males and 2 / 6 females). The CPT did not display improvement with treatment due to ceiling effects. Conclusions: Clinically significant adverse effects were not identified {{in this study of}} single dose <b>fenobam</b> across the range of dosages utilised. The positive effects seen in animal models of FXS treated with <b>fenobam</b> or other mGluR 5 antagonists, the apparent lack of clinically significant adverse effects, and the potential beneficial clinical effects seen in this pilot trial support further study of the compound in adults with FXS...|$|E

The mGluR 5 positive allosteric modulator (3 -cyano-N-(1, 3 -diphenyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -yl) benzamide (CDPPB) and negative allosteric modulator <b>fenobam</b> were tested in separate experiments. Sprague-Dawley rats were repeatedly injected with 1 mg/kg methamphetamine or saline, and then given a locomotor challenge test using a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg methamphetamine. Prior to the challenge test session, rats were injected with CDPPB, <b>fenobam,</b> or a vehicle.   Doses from previous studies showed reduced drug-conditioned behavior; however in this study neither CDPPB nor <b>fenobam</b> pretreatment resulted in an altered expression of behavioral sensitization, indicating a lack of mGluR 5 involvement in sensitized methamphetamine-induced locomotion. Additionally, the high dose (30 mg/kg) of <b>fenobam</b> resulted in decreased methamphetamine-induced locomotion in rats regardless of drug exposure history, which suggests evidence of nonspecific behavioral inhibition...|$|E

In addition, combinational treatment offenobam with PEP- 1 -FK 506 BP significantly inhibited the activationof Akt and MAPK induced by H 2 O 2, compared to treatment withPEP- 1 -FK 506 BP alone. Interestingly, our results showed thatfenobam significantly increased the transduction of PEP- 1 -FK 506 BPinto both C 6 cells and the hippocampus of gerbil brains.

Both <b>fenobam</b> and MPEP induced preference in the SNI mice, such that SNI mice spent significantly more time in the mGluR 5 antagonist-paired chamber compared to a vehicle-paired chamber. No such preference developed for sham mice. Morphine induced preference in male and female mice in both the SNI and sham groups. The results showed that <b>fenobam</b> and MPEP likely reduced on-going distress in the SNI mice, causing them to prefer the chamber paired with the drug compared to the vehicle-paired chamber.

40|$|Pharmacological {{manipulation}} of the type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu 5) receptor alters various addiction related behaviors such as drug self-administration and the extinction and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. However, the effects of pharmacological modulation of mGlu 5 receptors on brain reward function have not been widely investigated. We {{examined the effects of}} acute administration of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs, respectively) on brain reward function by assessing thresholds for intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). In addition, when acute effects were observed, we examined changes in ICSS thresholds following repeated administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with bipolar electrodes into the medial forebrain bundle and trained to respond for ICSS, followed by assessment of effects of mGlu 5 ligands on ICSS thresholds using a discrete trials current–intensity threshold determination procedure. Acute administration of the selective mGlu 5 NAMs MTEP (0, 0. 3, 1, or 3 [*]mg/kg) and <b>fenobam</b> (0, 3, 10, or 30 [*]mg/kg) dose-dependently increased ICSS thresholds (∼ 70 % at the highest dose tested), suggesting a deficit in brain reward function. Acute administration of the mGlu 5 PAMs CDPPB (0, 10, 30, and 60 [*]mg/kg) or ADX 47273 (0, 10, 30, and 60 [*]mg/kg) was without effect at any dose tested. When administered once daily for five consecutive days, the development of tolerance to the ability of threshold-elevating doses of MTEP and <b>fenobam</b> to increase ICSS thresholds was observed. We conclude that mGlu 5 PAMs and NAMs differentially affect brain reward function, and that tolerance to the ability of mGlu 5 NAMs to reduce brain reward function develops with repeated administration. These brain reward deficits should be taken into consideration when interpreting acute effects of mGlu 5 NAMs on drug self-administration, and repeated administration of these ligands may be an effective method to reduce these deficits...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCognitive {{deficits in}} fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) {{are attributed to}} molecular abnormalities of the brain’s vast and heterogeneous synapse populations. Unfortunately, the density of synapses coupled with their molecular heterogeneity presents formidable challenges in understanding the specific contribution of synapse changes in FXS. We demonstrate powerful new methods for the large-scale molecular analysis of individual synapses that allow quantification of numerous specific changes in synapse populations present in the cortex of a mouse model of FXS. Analysis of nearly a million individual synapses reveals distinct, quantitative changes in synaptic proteins distributed across over 6, 000 pairwise metrics. Some, but not all, of these synaptic alterations are reversed by treatment with the candidate therapeutic <b>fenobam,</b> an mGluR 5 antagonist. These patterns of widespread, but diverse synaptic protein changes in response to global perturbation suggest that FXS and its treatment must {{be understood as a}} networked system at the synapse level...|$|E
40|$|Osteosarcomas are {{malignant}} tumors of bone, {{most commonly}} seen {{in children and}} adolescents. Despite advances in modern medicine, the poor survival rate of metastatic osteosarcoma has not improved in two decades. In the present study we have investigated the effect of Riluzole on a human and mouse metastatic osteosarcoma cells. We show that LM 7 cells secrete glutamate {{in the media and}} that mGluR 5 receptors are required for the proliferation of LM 7 cells. Riluzole, which is known to inhibit glutamate release, inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and prevents migration of LM 7 cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder {{syndrome}} (IC/PBS), is {{a severely}} debilitating chronic condition that is frequently unresponsive to conventional pain medications. The etiology is unknown, however {{evidence suggests that}} nervous system sensitization contributes to enhanced pain in IC/PBS. In particular, central nervous system plasticity of glutamatergic signaling involving NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) has been implicated {{in a variety of}} chronic pain conditions. Here, we test the hypothesis that mGluR 5 mediates both non-inflammatory and inflammatory bladder pain or nociception in a mouse model by monitoring the visceromotor response (VMR) during graded bladder distention. Results Using a combination of genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we provide evidence indicating that mGluR 5 is necessary for the full expression of VMR in response to bladder distention in the absence of inflammation. Furthermore, we observed that mice infected with a uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (UPEC) develop inflammatory hyperalgesia to bladder distention, and that the selective mGluR 5 antagonist <b>fenobam</b> [N-(3 -chlorophenyl) -N'-(4, 5 -dihydro- 1 -methyl- 4 -oxo- 1 H-imidazole- 2 -yl) urea], reduces the VMR to bladder distention in UPEC-infected mice. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest that mGluR 5 modulates both inflammatory and non-inflammatory bladder nociception, and highlight the therapeutic potential for mGluR 5 antagonists in the alleviation of bladder pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's {{disease and}} L-DOPA-induced {{dyskinesia}} (LID) does not merely involve the dopamine (DA) system but also include non-dopaminergic {{systems such as}} glutamate and serotonin (5 -HT). An aberrant glutamate transmission at the corticostriatal synapse, {{has been linked to}} LID. Pharmacological agents to glutamate receptors at this synapse, (of which some are already clinically tested), could prevent the aberrant signalling and the consecutive development of LID. In this thesis, a rat model of the disease was used for evaluating and comparing the following substances for their effects on akinesia or dyskinesia as well as LID-associated molecular and morphological alterations: 1) antagonist for L-type calcium channels, 2) antagonist of the NR 2 B subtype selective NMDA receptor, 3) agonist of the presynaptic mGluR 2 / 3, 4) antagonist of postsynaptic mGluR 1 and 5) mGluR 5. Animals were treated chronically with a clinical relevant dose of L-DOPA with or without cotreatment with any of the antagonist/agonist. The L-type calcium channel antagonist isradipine, was shown inefficient in reducing LID. But notably, when isradipine was at an earlier time-point (i. e. at the time of DA denervation) it could prevent pathological alteration in morphology of striatal neurons (induced by the DA depletion), and reduce the development of LID. Therefore, isradipine could, in a prophylactic way, reduce the development of dyskinesia. When comparing the different glutamate targets (given after the DA denervation), results showed that the target of mGluR 5 was superior to all other receptors/channel, in relieving LID without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA. Prompted by these results, another mGluR 5 antagonist <b>fenobam,</b> that has been clinically tested, was evaluated in both rat and monkey model of PD. A more efficient alleviation of LID was achieved with a maximum effect of 70 %. Thereby, <b>fenobam</b> represents the most effective “antiglutamatergic” drug so far tested in experimental models of Parkinson's and acts similarly in rat and primate models of LID. The second half of the thesis evaluates the 5 -HT system. In the DA depleted striatum, L-DOPA is primarily taken up and converted to DA, in the residual striatal 5 -HT terminals. However, these do not have an autoregulatory machinery for DA release, and causes excessive DA release as a risk factor for dyskinesia. Here, a new mechanism of maladaptive plasticity induced by chronic L-DOPA treatment was revealed. Analysis of rat and monkey models of LID and post-mortem tissue from PD patients consistently showed a positive association between striatal 5 -HT fibre density and the severity of LID. This growth-promoting effect was paralleled with a greater stimulus-evoked DA release in dyskinetic animals compared to saline controls. Taken together, a maladaptive plasticity of 5 -HT fibres in the striatum, could be seen as a susceptibility factor for the development of LID. Moreover, it could provide a biomarker for LID...|$|E

In the present study, we have investigated structural determinants {{of the interaction}} of negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) with the seven-transmembrane (7 TM) domain of mGlu 5. A homology model of the 7 TM receptor domain built on the crystal structure of the mGlu 1 template was obtained, and the binding modes of known NAMs, namely MPEP and <b>fenobam,</b> were investigated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|Astrocytes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} cell types in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), and astrocyte swelling is the primary event associated with brain edema. Glutamate, the principal excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter in the CNS, is released at high levels after brain injury including cerebral ischemia. This leads to astrocyte swelling, which we previously demonstrated is related to metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. Aquaporin 4 (AQP 4), the predominant water channel in the brain, is expressed in astrocyte endfeet and plays an important role in brain edema following ischemia. Studies recently showed that mGluR 5 is also expressed on astrocytes. Therefore, it is worth investigating whether AQP 4 mediates the glutamate-induced swelling of astrocytes via mGluR 5. In the present study, we found that 1 mM glutamate induced astrocyte swelling, quantified by the cell perimeter, but it had no effect on astrocyte viability measured by the cell counting kit- 8 (CCK- 8) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that AQP 4, among AQP 1, 4, 5, 9 and 11, was the main molecular expressed in cultured astrocytes. Glutamate-induced cell swelling was accompanied by a concentration-dependent change in AQP 4 expression. Furthermore, RNAi technology revealed that AQP 4 gene silencing inhibited glutamate-induced astrocyte swelling. Moreover, we found that mGluR 5 expression was greatest among the mGluRs in cultured astrocytes and was co-expressed with AQP 4. Activation of mGluR 5 in cultured astrocytes using (S) - 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), an mGluR 5 agonist, mimicked the effect of glutamate. This effect was abolished by co-incubation with the mGluR 5 antagonist <b>fenobam</b> but was not influenced by DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid (DL-TBOA), a glutamate transporter inhibitor. Finally, experiments in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) revealed that co-expression of mGluR 5 and AQP 4 was increased in astrocyte endfeet around capillaries in the penumbra, and this was accompanied by brain edema. Collectively, these results suggest that glutamate induces cell swelling and alters AQP 4 expression in astrocytes via mGluR 5 activation, which may provide a novel approach for the treatment of edema following brain injury...|$|E
