5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} numerous {{jokes about}} and references to Ireland and its culture. First of all, the title {{refers to the}} Irish film In the Name of the Father. The Simpson family visits landmarks including Blarney Castle and Guinness Brewery {{as well as the}} Giant's Causeway. The fictional village of Dunkilderry contains yuppie leprechauns described by Grampa as [...] "yuprechauns" [...] and Homer drinks Guinness beer. An advertising executive with Guinness stated that a deal had to be worked out with The Simpsons producers in order for the brand to appear in the episode. The Simpsons visit Dublin on Bloomsday, a day when people recreate the events in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Homer says that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Ireland back to the [...] "good old days of Angela's Ashes", referencing Irish author Frank McCourt's memoir. In his flashback, Grampa dances in Riverdance style. Musicians Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová reprise their roles from the 2007 Irish film Once - much of which was originally shot in Mountjoy Square, Dublin, coincidentally a location that is also featured in Ulysses. A billboard in Ireland advertises a U2 moving company with the slogan [...] "We Move in Mysterious Ways".|$|E

500|$|In January 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created {{through a combination of}} CGI and motion capture, going on to say that [...] "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon – they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the characters." [...] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been {{on the other side of}} that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." [...] Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the Star Wars films, was revealed to be working on the film.|$|E
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

He plans to afford it through a bonus from his employer, the Special Delivery Service (SDS), but their new boss, Edwin Carbunkle (voiced by Peter Woodward), has cancelled all bonuses. He plans to make SDS more efficient by replacing its human workers with robots, thinking that being friendly is a waste of time.|$|E

50|$|Mansfield's tenure with Barnaby lasted {{two years}} (1971-73) chiefly because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the label heavy into the {{emerging}} contemporary country market, which {{evolved into the}} exciting “Outlaw” movement.

60|$|As I {{read over}} the last few {{chapters}} of this narrative, I see that I have been giving the reader a rather too jumpy time.

The reader can stand having his emotions churned up to a certain point; after that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it easy. It is with pleasure, therefore, that I turn now to depict a quiet, peaceful scene in domestic life. It won't last long--three minutes, perhaps, by a stop-watch--but that is not my fault. My task is to record facts as they happened.|$|E
