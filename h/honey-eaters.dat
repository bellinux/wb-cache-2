2500|$|The main {{families}} of specialized nectar feeding birds {{that are involved}} in ornithophily are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), sunbirds (Nectariniidae), and the <b>honey-eaters</b> (Meliphagidae). Other important bird groups include those in the families the Icteridae, the honeycreepers (Thraupidae, Drepanidae), white-eyes (Zosteropidae) and the South African sugar-birds (Promeropidae).

6000|$|The early {{singing of}} the oven-bird fledgling is important, {{owing to the}} fact that the group it belongs to {{comprises}} the least specialized forms in the family. They are strong-legged, square-tailed, terrestrial birds, generally able to perch, have probing beaks, and build the most perfect mud or stick nests, or burrow in the ground. In the numerous tree-creeping groups, which, seem as unrelated to the oven-bird as the woodpecker is to the hoopoe, we find a score of wonderfully different forms of beak; but many of them retain the probing character, and are actually used to probe in rotten wood on trees, and to explore the holes and deep crevices in the trunk. We have also seen that some of these tree-creepers revert to the ancestral habit (if I may so call it) of seeking their food by probing in the soil. In others, like Dendrornis, in which the beak has lost this character, and is used to dig in the wood or to strip off the bark, it has not been highly specialized, and, compared with the woodpecker's beak, is a very imperfect organ, considering the purpose for which it is used. Yet, on the principle that [...] "similar functional requirements frequently lead to the development of similar structures in animals which are otherwise very distinct"--as we see in the tubular tongue in <b>honey-eaters</b> and humming birds--we might have expected to find in the Dendrocolaptidae a better imitation of the woodpecker in so variable an organ as the beak, if not in the tongue.|$|E
50|$|Her {{contributions}} are commemorated by an altar-frontal, showing banksias and <b>honey-eaters,</b> in St Michael's Anglican Church, Mount Pleasant, Western Australia, {{and by the}} Nancy T.

The Australian Plant Name Index is dedicated to her memory and a peak in Namadgi is named Mount Burbidge in her honour.|$|E
50|$|The flowers contain three flowered umbels with peduncles (flower stalks) up to 2.5 cm {{long and}} often {{longer than the}} {{petioles}} (leaf stalks). Buds are 1.2 cm long, glaucous to brown, receptacle urceolate (urn shaped); operculum (cap) shorter than the receptacle but broader with a rounded margin and umbonate (knob like) apex.The flowers are white, blooming between October and March and are typical eucalypt flowers in that the obvious floral structure is the mass of stamens. The petals fuse early in bud development to form the operculum (cap) which is later shed to reveal the stamens. Similarly, the sepals form an outer operculum which is shed early in bud development. The flowers are pollinated by birds such as Yellow-throated Honeyeater (Lichenostomus flavicollis), Black-headed <b>Honey-eater</b> (Melithreptus affinis) and Strong-billed <b>Honey-eater</b> (Melithreptus validirostris).|$|R

Spot kingfishers, <b>honey-eaters,</b> fairy-wrens and pigeons. Other wildlife may be seen along the way such as brown bandicoots and northern quolls. This walk is graded as difficult, and takes about two days.|$|E

50|$|The {{bird fauna}} of heathlands are usually {{cosmopolitan}} {{species of the}} region. In the depauperate heathlands of Europe, bird species {{tend to be more}} characteristic of the community and include Montagu's harrier, and the tree pipit. In Australia the heathland avian fauna is dominated by nectar-feeding birds such as <b>honey-eaters</b> and lorikeets although numerous other birds from emus to eagles are also common in Australian heathlands. Australian heathlands are also home to the world's only nectar-feeding terrestrial mammal: the honey possum. The bird fauna of the South African fynbos includes sunbirds, warblers and siskins. Heathlands are also an excellent habitat for insects including ants, moths, butterflies and wasps with many species being restricted entirely to it.|$|E
5000|$|The species feeds in {{the foliage}} of trees on insects, {{including}} beetles, grasshoppers, wasps, ants and moths. It {{is less likely}} to catch prey in the air than other gerygones, but will join mixed-species feeding flocks with white-eyes, <b>honey-eaters</b> and fantails. The species mostly feeds in the canopy but will forage amongst the roots of mangroves. The mangrove gerygone breeds throughout the year, although principally in spring-summer in the east of Australia and during the dry season in the north. The female builds the oval domed nest. It is constructed out of roots, grass, spider webs, moss, seaweed and bark, and hangs from mangroves. Two to three eggs, [...] are laid in the nest and are incubated for 14-17 days. Both parents feed the chick for another 14-17 days. A number of cuckoo species are brood parasites of this species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} {{explication}} of character displacement, {{many of the}} examples they set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian <b>honey-eaters</b> of the genus Myzantha, Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos (Brown and Wilson 1956). Lack (1947) found that when the two species Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza fortis island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.|$|E
40|$|Extract] You {{might think}} that a lot of strange things turn up in my backyard, if you didn't {{actually}} live in Ibisville. For the tropics, though, the yard itself is pretty ordinary: picket fence, big hibiscus shrubs, golden cane and fan palms, banks of military ferns, shade-houses at the back and sides. Spreading over it all, the quandong and fiddlewood and African mahogany trees. But an ibis comes, of course, one or several, I can never tell, though he or she's there every year, as soon as it gets dry: striding and jabbing wherever the hoses ran. There are <b>honey-eaters,</b> too, three or four sorts, and once a Wompoo pigeon, orange and green and sumptuous purple bosom, a bulky vision in the quandong tree. And a few times, a black-and-yellow treesnake, getting a bit too close to the windows, in pursuit of poorly cached green frogs...|$|E
40|$|I present new {{information}} about 34 of the 195 resident land and freshwater bird species of Northern Melanesia, an area characterized by a rich avifauna, high endemism, and great geographic variation in morphology. There are many examples of geographic variation in voice, behavior, habitat preference, altitudinal range, vertical stratum, abundance, and nest. Possible vocal convergence or mimicry between sympatric populations of different species is described between the goshawk Accipiter albogularis and the kingfisher Halcyon chloris, between the cuckoo-shrike Coracina [tenuirostris] and other species in its mixed-species foraging flocks, between the white-eyes Zosterops murphyi and Z. rendovae kulambangrae, and between the starlings Aplonis grandis and Mino dumontii. Hybridization is reported between the Bismarck and New Guinea races of the cuckoo Eudynamys scolopacea on Long Island (described as a new subspecies), between the whistlers Pachycephala pectoralis and P. melanura, and between the <b>honey-eaters</b> Myzomela tristrami and M. cardinalis. Cyclones bring Australian species, some of which occasionally remain to breed. Over-water dispersal ability varies greatly, from species {{that can be seen}} flying over water any day to species that rarely or never cross water. For instance, a channel 12 km long and only 0. 15 - 1 km wide divides Florida Island into two halves, one of which possesses and the other of which lacks a resident population of the coucal Centropus milo...|$|E
