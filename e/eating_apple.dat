50|$|Malus niedzwetzkyana {{has been}} used to breed some modern red-leaved, red-flowered, and red-fruited apples and crabapples. It is {{believed}} to be the ancestor of Surprise, a pink-fleshed apple that was brought to the United States by German immigrants around 1840 and was later used by the horticulturist Albert Etter to breed some 30 pink- and red-fleshed varieties, the best-known of which is Pink Pearl. Another horticulturist, Niels Ebbesen Hansen, encountered M. niedzwetzkyana in the Ili valley, where he also met Niedzwetzky, in what was then the Russian region of Turkestan (but now Kazakhstan) during his 1897 expedition.

5000|$|A {{harsh winter}} in 1934 wiped out {{many of the}} Baldwin apple {{orchards}} in New England. Its popularity as an <b>eating</b> <b>apple</b> waned, but some orchards were preserved for many years because of its desirability as a mixing apple for cider. However, the orchards have not been replaced when they played out. Baldwin Apples, unlike many apples, have long been prized for the making of hard cider. [...] "West County Cider" [...] makes Baldwin Cider from trees planted in the early 1900s. It is their most popular cider.The apple is noted for its particularly small to medium size (ca. 6-8 cm), {{when compared to other}} apples like the Macintosh. It is an exceptionally hard apple and would remain remarkably free from blemishes and other blights with few pesticides being needed. Because of its hardness it shipped well without bruising and for a time was prized for this quality. Aside from cider making it was also known as an exceptionally good pie apple and due to its inherent hardness would maintain more crispness through the baking process than other apples would.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{presence}} of IgE antibodies to the allergens rBetvl and rBetv 2 {{was investigated in}} the sera of 99 patients with specific IgE to apple extract by comparing a group of 43 patients who had oral allergy syndrome (OAS) after ingestion of apple {{with a group of}} 56 patients without OAS who had only seasonal respiratory symptoms. The incidence of the {{presence of}} IgE antibodies to rBetv 1 was 88. 1 %. All patients had levels of IgE to apple extract greater than 0. 35 kU/L. After <b>eating</b> <b>apple,</b> patients allergic to birch pollen with OAS showed significantly higher levels of IgE to apple extract and rBetv 1 than patients without OAS (P= 0. 007 and P= 0. 0002, respectively). Twenty of 56 patients (35. 7 %) in the group without OAS who produced specific IgE to apple did not have specific IgE against rBetv 1 and rBetv 2 and were symptomless after <b>eating</b> <b>apple.</b> In conclusion, patients allergic to birch pollen with specific IgE to rBetv 1 showed a significantly elevated frequency of apple allergy. In contrast, our results show that fruit-related symptoms require not only high specific serum IgE levels, but a strong cellular sensitization to birch pollen allergens, together with an increased cellular reactivity to apple allergens...|$|E

Food allergy {{is one of}} the most spread allergic diseases. Oral allergic syndrome is the most common form of food allergy occurred at adult population which stems from a cross- reactivity between pollen allergens and food allergens of vegetable origin. Nowadays it is known as pollen-food syndrome. There has been laboratory tested 40 patients positive for sIgE by ISAC as a part of this thesis.

This positive relationship between sIgE and clinical positive manifestations are very tight and in terms if diagnostic benefit.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2005, we {{reported}} {{on the success of}} Comprehensive School Health (CSH) in improving diets, activity levels, and body weights. The successful program was recognized as a "best practice" and has inspired the development of the Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy <b>Eating</b> (<b>APPLE)</b> Schools. The project includes 10 schools, most of which are located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. The present study examines the effectiveness of a CSH program adopted from a "best practice" example in another setting by evaluating temporal changes in diets, activity levels and body weight. Methods In 2008 and 2010, we surveyed grade 5 students from approximately 150 randomly selected schools from the Canadian province of Alberta and students from 10 APPLE Schools. Students completed the Harvard Youth/Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire, questions on physical activity, and had their height and weight measured. Multilevel regression methods were used to analyze changes in diets, activity levels, and body weight between 2008 and 2010. Results In 2010 relative to 2008, students attending APPLE Schools were eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming fewer calories, were more physically active and were less likely obese. These changes contrasted changes observed among students elsewhere in the province. Conclusions These findings provide evidence on the effectiveness of CSH in improving health behaviors. They show that an example of "best practice" may lead to success in another setting. Herewith the study provides the evidence that investments for broader program implementation based on "best practice" are justified. </p...|$|E
