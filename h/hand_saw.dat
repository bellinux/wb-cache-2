5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>saw</b> {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian JÃ¼rgen Moltmann, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>saw</b> infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E

5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the <b>hand</b> <b>saw.</b> By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E

25|$|The {{paranoia}} {{that rose}} up around Hashimi's announcement and {{the reports that}} the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to leave Iraq, believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions.

Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that he was convinced that Ajaan Mun was an arahant.

25|$|In 1912, Rocker {{was once}} again an {{important}} figure in a strike by London's garment makers. In late April, 1,500 tailors from the West End, who were more highly skilled and better-paid {{than those in the}} East End, started striking. By May, the total number was between 7,000 and 8,000. Since much of the West Enders' work was now being performed in the East End, the tailors' union there, {{under the influence of the}} Arbeter Fraint group, decided to support the strike. Rudolf Rocker on the one <b>hand</b> <b>saw</b> this as a chance for the East End tailors to attack the sweatshop system, but on the other was afraid of an anti-Semitic backlash, should the Jewish workers remain idle. He called for a general strike. His call was not followed, since over seventy percent of the East End tailors were engaged in the ready-made trade, which was not linked with the West End workers' strike. Nonetheless, 13,000 immigrant garment workers from the East End went on strike following a May 8 assembly at which Rocker spoke. Not one worker voted against a strike. Rocker became a member of the strike committee and chairman of the finance sub-committee. He was responsible for collecting money and other necessities for the striking workers. On the side he published the Arbeter Fraint newspaper on a daily basis to disseminate news about the strike. He spoke at the workers' assemblies and demonstrations. On May 24 a mass meeting was held to discuss the question of whether to settle on a compromise proposed by the employers, which did not entail a closed union shop. A speech by Rocker convinced the workers to continue the strike. By the next morning, all of the workers' demands were met.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} of objective measurements (contact pressure and productivity) with subjective experienced comfort and discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> was examined. Professional carpenters evaluated five different <b>hand</b> <b>saws.</b> The pressure-time integral during the static pressure measurement (beta = â 0. 24, p<. 01) was highly related to comfort {{and the pressure}} area during static pressure measurement was highly related to local perceived discomfort (beta = 0. 45, p<. 01).

500|$|According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee {{public defender}} {{and member of}} the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was {{negotiated}} in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because [...] "prospects of losing at trial were very good." [...] Bundy, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>saw</b> the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a [...] "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal. At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. [...] "It made him realize {{he was going to have}} to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. [...] "He just couldn't do it." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study the {{relationship}} between objective measurements and subjective experienced comfort and discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> was examined. 12 carpenters evaluated five different <b>hand</b> <b>saws.</b> Objective measures of contact pressure (average pressure, pressure area and P-t integral) in static and dynamic conditions, muscle activity (EMG) of five muscles of the upper extremity, and productivity were obtained during a sawing task. Subjective comfort and discomfort were assessed using the Comfort Questionnaire for Hand tools and a scale for Local Perceived Discomfort (LPD). We {{did not find any}} relationship between muscle activity and comfort or discomfort. The P-t integral during the static measurement (beta=â 0. 24, p<. 01) was the best predictor of comfort and the pressure area during static measurement was the best predictor of local perceived discomfort (beta= 0. 45, p<. 01).

2500|$|On July 1, 1948, the New York City Board of Transportation {{took over}} all of the bus lines on Staten Island, {{and as a result}} the bus fare on Staten Island dropped from 5 cents per zone (20 cents Tottenville to the ferry) to 7 cents for the whole island to match the fare of the other city-owned bus lines.

In 1947, the SIRT had carried 12.3 million passengers, but after the change the number decreased to 8.7 million in 1948 and to 4.4 million in 1949.

2500|$|The {{proposed}} Constitution {{was sent}} to the Assembly, where its members began working towards its promulgation.

The Absolutists, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>saw</b> their interests threatened when BonifÃ¡cio issued two decrees which eliminated privileges reserved for those of Portuguese birth. Although holding many ideological differences, the Absolutists and the Nativists formed an alliance in order to remove their common enemy from power. BonifÃ¡cio himself had begun to lose support inside his own faction due to his arbitrary actions. A far more important factor which fueled the ever-increasing number of dissidents was reaction to the radical, if prescient, ideas he heldâincluding the abolition of slavery. Eventually, disaffected members constituted a majority of the seats in the Assembly and signed a petition requesting the dismissal of BonifÃ¡cio's Cabinet.
