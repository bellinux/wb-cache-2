40|$|A {{psychomotor}} {{investigation has}} been carried out among 30 neonates; the investigation made use of the progressive Brunet-Lezine scale. In this way, postural and oculomotor problems were revealed which involved especially a depression of the <b>development</b> <b>quotient.</b> In calculating the <b>development</b> <b>quotient</b> just and equally, the other aspects mentioned, the authors tried to establish a psychomotor profile of these neonates. In following up these children they saw that postural difficulties had become reduced by the age of between 10 and 19 mth and it did not seem that the children were late in developing, as measured by their ability to walk (with or without help). In contrast, it seemed that the hand-eye co-ordination problems which had been detected earlier on persisted, and this was especially shown by the rattle test and playing with building blocks. Eventually it was revealed by {{the way in which the}} children handled small objects, scribbled or engaged in other graphic acitivities. Language problems only revealed themselves in two children, and at the age of 3. 5 yr speech therapy was started. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY One {{hundred and}} fifteen of 121 {{children}} consecutively admitted to hospital, each {{with his first}} febrile convulsion, were subsequently assessed on the Griffiths's mental development scales {{during a period of}} 24 months The effect of anticonvulsant medication on intellectual development was studied in 50 of the 73 children without recurrence of convulsions who had either continuous phenobarbitone, continuous sodium valproate, or no drugs during the 24 - month period. The effect of further fits was studied in 42 of the 115 children who had recurrences. Children with further febrile convulsions showed a decrease in Griffiths's <b>development</b> <b>quotient</b> between the initial and 24 -month assessment, whereas children with no subsequent fits showed a trend in the reverse direction. The increase in Griffiths's <b>development</b> <b>quotient</b> in children with no subsequent fits was found irre-spective of whether the children were on anticonvulsant medication, but there was a non-significant tendency for this increase to be greatest in the group without drugs.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} therapy and prognosis {{in children with}} transient congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Methods: Fifty-seven children with CH diagnosed after neonatal screening were treated with low-dosage levothyroxine (L-T 4). Follow-up evaluation included the determination of TT 3, TT 4 and TSH serum levels and the assessment of thyroid gland morphology, bone age, growth <b>development</b> and <b>development</b> <b>quotients</b> (DQ). A full check-up was performed at age 2, when the affected children first discontinued the L-T 4 treatment for 1 month, and one year later. <b>Development</b> <b>quotients</b> were compared with a control group of 29 healthy peers. Results: The initial L-T 4 dosage administered was 3. 21 ~ 5. 81 μg/(kg·d) {{with an average of}} (16. 25 ± 3. 87) μg/d. Mean duration of therapy was (28. 09 ± 9. 56) months. No significant difference was found between study group and control group in the DQ test (average score (106. 58 ± 14. 40) vs (102. 4 ± 8. 6), P> 0. 05) and 96. 49 % of the CH children achieved a test score above 85. Bone age, 99 mTc scans and ultrasonographic findings were all normal, and evaluation of physical development was normal too, as were the serum levels of TT 3, TT 4 and TSH after one year of follow-up. Conclusion: A L-T 4 dosage of 3. 21 ~ 5. 81 μg/(kg·d) was found sufficient for the treatment of transient CH. The treated children showed satisfactory overall mental and physical development at age 2.

40|$|Objective: Analysis of the {{relationship}} between treatment and improvement oil language scores in children with language problems. Design: Observational longitudinal Study. Materials and methods: 123 children between 2 and 5 years of age, diagnosed as having a language problem were followed for 1 year. By means of monthly questionnaires, the form of intervention received was recorded. Language abilities were measured at baseline and after 1 year. Mixed model analysis was used to determine {{the relationship}} between improvement and language scores. Results: During the year 119 parents returned the monthly questionnaires and four treatment groups were subsequently able to be categorized: language treatment (n= 21, 18 %), surgical hearing improvement (n = 16, 13 %), language treatment and surgical hearing improvement (n = 42, 35 %) and a three-combination group (language treatment, Surgical hearing improvement and developmental guidance, n = 40, 34 %). For the four treatment groups {{there were no significant differences}} at baseline for the Language Comprehension Quotient (LCQ) (p = 0. 07) and Sentence <b>Development</b> <b>Quotient</b> (SDQ) (p = 0. 09). In all treatment groups the mean Sentence <b>Development</b> <b>Quotient</b> improved significantly (p = 0. 001). The mean Language Comprehension Quotient did not improve in the Surgical hearing improvement group (p = 0. 42), but improved significantly in the language treatment group, in the language treatment and surgical hearing improvement group and in the three-combination group (p = 0. 002, 0. 040, 0. 001). From all included children 38 children (32 %) moved from an inadequate to an adequate language score. Conclusion: All distinguished forms of treatment were effective. However, only for a proportion of the children this meant a clinical relevant improvement. For the improvement Of language comprehension targeted language therapy seems essential, as children without this (children receiving surgical hearing impairment) did not improve their LCQ.

40|$|Professionals {{interested}} {{in the area of}} psychological assessment are becoming increasingly sensitive towards the need for instruments capable of integrating the systemic and epigenetic character of the developmental process into its design. Most of the proposals put forward in recent decades coincide in considering developmental change {{as the result of a}} complex network of transactions between the subject and its developmental contexts at different levels. The Scale of Harmonic Development combines elements sensitive to the dynamism of the ontogenetic process: areas and functions of development which experience generative tensions of quantitative and qualitative change across different levels and stages. These stages, understood as "attractor states -a key concept in the Self-organizing Dynamic Systems Theory-, lose rigidity and integrate variability.

This study evaluated {{the development of these}} skills in 301 three-year-old deaf and hard of hearing children (M: 37. 8 months) and considered a range of possible predictors including gender, birth weight, age at first fitting with hearing devices, hearing device used, presence of additional disabilities, severity of hearing loss, maternal education, socio-economic status (SES), language ability, and communication mode. Caregivers reported on children’s development using the Child Development Inventory (CDI). On average, both psychosocial and motor <b>development</b> <b>quotients</b> were within the typical range for hearing children, with large individual differences. There was a positive correlation between language ability and both social and motor development, and also between social and motor development.

This study investigated the developmental profiles and temperament patterns in children with spastic CP (sCP) of different subtypes and severities. MethodsOne hundred and five children, aged 3 – 6 years, with sCP and 66 children with typical development (TD) were analyzed. Children with sCP were classified into spastic diplegia (SD; n = 60), and spastic quadriplegia (SQ; n = 45) groups. Motor severity was classified via the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). <b>Development</b> <b>quotients</b> (DQs) of eight domains and temperament scores of nine dimensions were evaluated. ResultsThe SQ group had lower DQs in all developmental functions than the SD group (p < 0. 01). The DQ distributions of developmental profiles showed the same trend in SD and SQ groups, and both groups displayed lowest DQs in the gross motor domain. The SQ group was less adaptable and approachable than the TD group (p < 0. 05), and both sCP groups had lower attention span and persistence and a higher threshold of responsiveness than the TD group (p < 0. 05). Correlation analysis showed that GMFCS levels were highly related to all developmental functions (r < − 0. 54, p< 0. 01) and weakly related to some temperament dimensions in children with sCP.

Ability to put weight on the hands while prone and to roll from supine to prone position by 18 months of age were significantly related to independent walking, while ability to sit without support was predictive only at around 24 months of age...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the degree of}} neurological compromise in HIV-infected children accompanied by the outpatient clinic of infectious diseases and pediatric neurology of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) starting in 1995. Long-term progressive prospective and cross sectional study of 88 children infected by HIV and 84 seroreverter children, using data from general neurological examinations, neuroimaging procedures (brain CT scan) and neurodevelopmental tests (CAT/CLAMS and DENVER I and II). Neurological and neurodevelopmental alterations were found in 82 % of the HIV-infected patients and in 36 % of the HIV-seroreverter group (P < 0. 01). In the CAT/CLAMS test, the <b>development</b> <b>quotient</b> (DQ) of the HIV-infected group was significantly {{lower than that of}} the HIV-seroreverter group. CAT/CLAMS scores lower than 70 (mental deficiency) were found in 31 % of the HIV-infected patients {{during the first year of}} life and in only 1 % of the patients of the HIV-seroreverter group, demonstrating the validity of this screening test for precocious detection of alterations in the neurodevelopment of infected patients. The same occurred with the Denver I and II tests, as the HIV-infected group failed more frequently than the HIV-seroreverter group. Nine HIV-infected children presented altered brain CT scans; calcification of basal ganglia was the main finding (five cases). Encephalopathy due to HIV causes early arrest of neurodevelopment, which can be detected with screening tests during the first year of life...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{compositional}} specification theory for reasoning about components that interact by synchronisation of {{input and output}} (I/O) actions, in which the specification of a component constrains the temporal ordering of interactions with the environment. Such a theory is motivated {{by the need to}} support composability of components, in addition to modelling environmental assumptions, and reasoning about run-time behaviour. Models can be specified operationally by means of I/O labelled transition systems augmented by an inconsistency predicate on states, or in a purely declarative manner by means of traces. We introduce a refinement preorder that supports safe-substitutivity of components. Our specification theory includes the operations of parallel composition for composing components at run-time, logical conjunction for independent <b>development,</b> and <b>quotient</b> for incremental <b>development.</b> We prove congruence properties of the operations and show correspondence between the operational and declarative frameworks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about the neurocognitive outcome in {{children}} exposed to perinatal mother-to-child Chikungunya virus (p-CHIKV) infection. MethodsThe CHIMERE ambispective cohort study compared the neurocognitive function of 33 p-CHIKV-infected children (all but one enrolled retrospectively) at around two years of age with 135 uninfected peers (all enrolled prospectively). Psychomotor development was assessed using the revised Brunet-Lezine scale, examiners blinded to infectious status. <b>Development</b> <b>quotients</b> (DQ) with subscores covering movement/posture, coordination, language, sociability skills were calculated. Predictors of global neurodevelopmental delay (GND, DQ≤ 85), were investigated using multivariate Poisson regression modeling. Neuroradiologic follow-up using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was proposed for most of the children with severe forms. ResultsThe mean DQ score was 86. 3 (95 %CI: 81. 0 – 91. 5) in infected children compared to 100. 2 (95 %CI: 98. 0 – 102. 5) in uninfected peers (P< 0. 001). Fifty-one percent (n =  17) of infected children had a GND compared to 15 % (n =  21) of uninfected children (P< 0. 001). Specific neurocognitive delays in p-CHIKV-infected children were as follows: coordination and language (57 %), sociability (36 %), movement/posture (27 %). After adjustment for maternal social situation, small for gestational age, and head circumference, p-CHIKV infection was found associated with GND (incidence rate ratio: 2. 79, 95 %CI: 1. 45 – 5. 34). Further adjustments on gestational age or breastfeeding did not change the independent effect of CHIKV infection on neurocognitive outcome. The mean DQ of p-CHIKV-infected children was lower in severe encephalopathic children than in non-severe children (77. 6 versus 91. 2, P< 0. 001). Of the 12 cases of CHIKV neonatal encephalopathy, five developed a microcephaly (head circumference <− 2 standard deviations) and four matched the definition of cerebral palsy. MRI scans showed severe restrictions of white matter areas, predominant in the frontal lobes in these children. ConclusionsThe neurocognitive outcome of children exposed to perinatal mother-to-child CHIKV infection is poor. Severe CHIKV neonatal encephalopathy is associated with an even poorer outcome...|$|R
