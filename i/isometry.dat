5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an <b>isometry</b> mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|The first paper, {{written with}} Jordan and Kundt, is a {{treatise}} {{on how to}} characterize exact solutions to Einstein's field equations in a systematic way. The analysis presented there uses tools from differential geometry such as the Petrov classification of Weyl tensors (that is, {{those parts of the}} Riemann tensor describing the curvature of space-time that are not constrained by Einstein's equations), <b>isometry</b> groups and conformal transformations. This work also includes the first definition and classification of pp-waves, a class of simple gravitational waves.|$|E

In this paper we associate a free action on an R-tree to any finite system of <b>isometries</b> without reflection. Any free action may be approximated (strongly {{in the sense of}} Gillet-Shalen) by actions arising in this way.

That is, we provide geometric conditions for each such pair to be linked by half-turns. The main result gives a necessary and sufficient condition for any given pair of <b>isometries</b> to be linked.
