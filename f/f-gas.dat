40|$|A {{comprehensive}} field {{investigation was}} conducted at Potrero Hills Landfill (PHL) located in Suisun City, California to quantify emissions of twelve (hydro) chlorofluorocarbons (i. e. F-gases). The specific target constituents for this study included CFC- 11, CFC- 12, CFC- 113, CFC- 114, HCFC- 21, HCFC- 22, HCFC- 141 b, HCFC- 142 b, HCFC- 151 a, HFC- 134 a, HFC- 152 a, and HFC- 245 fa. The majority of the <b>F-gas</b> emission {{studies have been conducted}} outside of the United States and very limited field landfill emission data are available in the United States. Because of historical usage of blowing agents in insulation foams including CFC- 11, HCFC- 142 b, HFC- 134 a, and HFC- 245 fa, models reported in literature predicted high <b>F-gas</b> emissions from a landfill environment, but very limited field data are available to verify such predictions. In this investigation, the surface flux of the twelve F-gases, methane, and carbon dioxide was quantified from various landfill cover systems and in areas with different waste ages, waste heights, and cover thicknesses at Potrero Hills Landfill. In addition, destruction efficiencies for the twelve F-gases were determined based on inlet and outlet concentrations of the onsite flare system. Lastly, the surface flux values were scaled up to a facility-wide emission value to estimate the total fugitive emissions from the landfill. The <b>F-gas</b> flux values for the daily covers were in the 10 - 8 to 10 - 1 g m- 2 day - 1 range and 10 - 7 to 10 - 2 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. The <b>F-gas</b> flux values for the intermediate covers in the - 10 - 6 to 10 - 4 g m- 2 day- 1 range and - 10 - 6 to 10 - 4 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. The <b>F-gas</b> flux values for the final covers were in the 10 - 7 to 10 - 5 g m- 2 day- 1 range and - 10 - 7 to 10 - 6 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. <b>F-gas</b> fluxes for the final covers had the highest number of below detection limit cases as well as lower than R 2 threshold cases. Thest <b>F-gas</b> fluxes were measured from daily cover system constructed with auto shredder residue (i. e. auto fluff) for the both the wet and dry seasons. The highest fluxes were measured for CFC- 11, HCFC- 21, and HCFC- 141 b in the wet season and for CFC- 11, HCFC- 141 b, and HFC- 134 a in the dry season across the seven cover locations. Lower level of variation was observed for methane and carbon dioxide with flux values ranging over five orders of magnitude for the seven tested locations. The methane flux values for the daily covers were in the 10 - 2 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 d- 1 range and 1 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. The carbon dioxide flux values for the daily covers were in the - 10 + 1 to 10 + 2 g m- 2 day- 1 range and - 10 + 1 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. The methane flux values for the intermediate covers were in the - 10 - 2 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 d- 1 range and - 10 - 3 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. The carbon dioxide flux values for the intermediate covers were in the 1 to 10 + 2 g m- 2 day- 1 range for both seasons. The methane fluxes for the final cover were - 10 - 3 g m- 2 day- 1 and 10 - 4 g m- 2 day- 1 for the wet and dry season, respectively. The carbon dioxide flux values for the final cover were in the 10 + 1 g m- 2 d- 1 range and 1 to 10 + 1 g m- 2 day- 1 range for the wet and dry season, respectively. Negative flux values were typically observed during the wet season and at the intermediate and final covers. The destruction efficiencies for the twelve F-gases were above 99. 5 % for the onsite flare. Highest <b>F-gas</b> raw gas concentrations were measured for HFC- 134 a while the lowest <b>F-gas</b> concentration was measured for CFC- 113. The <b>F-gas</b> concentrations in the raw gas ranged from 103 to 106 pptv. Similar to what has been reported in the literature, the landfill gas flare system was an efficient abatement device in controlling <b>F-gas</b> emissions. The surface emission measurement values from the field investigation were scaled up to estimate facility-wide fugitive emission values using the relative surface areas of the daily, intermediate, and final cover distributions in the landfill. The total fugitive emissions from the landfill including twelve F-gases, methane, and carbon dioxide ranged from 6, 900 to 94, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the wet season, from 21, 000 to 47, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the dry season, and from 13, 000 to 75, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the year, prorated by the season (representing weighted average of 58 % wet season emission rate and 42 % dry season emission rate in a 12 -month calendar year). The total fugitive <b>F-gas</b> emissions ranged from 1, 600 to 4, 800 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the wet season, from 140 to 600 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the dry season, and from 1, 000 to 3, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year, prorated by the season. The total fugitive methane emissions ranged from 530 to 75, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the wet season, 17, 000 to 35, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the dry season, and from 7, 500 to 58, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year, prorated by the season. The total fugitive carbon dioxide emissions ranged from 5, 000 to 14, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the wet season, 4, 200 to 12, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year during the dry season, and from 4, 500 to 13, 000 CO 2 E tonnes per year, prorated by the season. In comparison to the total fugitive emission value derived from the first-order decay (FOD) model reported by USEPA and the total fugitive emission values calculated using waste-in-place (WIP) – landfill gas correlation equation presented in Spokas et al.

This report describes the first implementation (Version 1. 0) of the model extension model to incorporate emissions of the Fgases, i. e., HFC, PFC and SF 6. GAINS Version 1. 0 assesses 230 options for reducing <b>F-gas</b> emissions from the various source categories. It quantifies for 43 countries/regions in Europe country-specific application potentials of the various options in the different sectors of the economy, and estimates the societal resource costs of these measures. Mitigation potentials are estimated in relation to an exogenous baseline projection that reflects current planning. The initial implementation of GAINS 1. 0 estimates for 1995 total <b>F-gas</b> emissions in the European model domain (39 countries including the European part of Russia) at around 87 Mt CO 2 eq.

This energy is used subsequently as a cold source at the water evaporator in order to improve the average coefficient of performance and to run a defrosting sequence at the air evaporator. Two refrigerants are studied: HFC R 407 C and carbon dioxide. HFCs provide good performance, but new restrictive regulations on <b>F-gases</b> lead us to study low-GWP refrigerants as well. Highly efficient models of compressors and heat exchangers have been defined. Annual simulations show that CO 2 is a refrigerant which adapts rather well to the operation of the HPS thanks to the higher amount of energy available by subcooling and the large temperature glide at heat rejection used for DHW production...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from fuel combustion constitute {{the majority of}} anthropogenic GHG emissions. However, comprehensive analysis of emissions and emission trends considers other sources of CO 2 {{as well as other}} gases. To complement work regarding the emissions of CO 2 from fuel combustion, the IEA elected to include the EDGAR data on other CO 2 sources and on five other greenhouse gases; CH 4, N 2 O and the fluorinated gases (or “F-gases”) HFCs, PFCs and SF 6. These gases are addressed by the Kyoto Protocol. When considering comparative shares and trends in GHG emissions, data on gases and sources other than CO 2 from fuel combustion are much more uncertain. Country-specific estimates of CO 2 from biomass burning and <b>F-gas</b> emissions are particularly difficult to ascertain. JRC. H. 2 -Air and Climat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceR- 410 A {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{refrigerants}} used for air conditioning and heat pump systems. This refrigerant has a high GWP and it is nowadays question of phasing it out (European <b>F-gas</b> directive). In Japan, R- 32 is considered as a potential replacement for R- 410 A (Barve, 2012). This refrigerant permits to reduce the GWP from 2090 kgeq CO 2 to 675 kgeq CO 2 but presents an issue with the compressor outlet temperature especially in hot climate countries. HFO refrigerants gained attention recently especially with the European mobile air conditioning regulation. These refrigerants have a GWP lower than 10 but have lower volumetric cooling capacity than R- 410 A and flammability issues. Refrigerant manufacturers are currently developing new refrigerant blends permitting to match heating capacity of R- 410 A with low GWPs. Within the AHRI AREP initiative, four low GWP candidates for R- 410 A replacement are tested in a water chiller. This paper presents these test results...|$|E
40|$|R 404 A {{is largely}} used in {{refrigerated}} transportation systems. Given {{the relatively high}} refrigerant leakage rates of transportation systems and the relatively high 100 -year GWP (3943) of R 404 A, it is increasingly under scrutiny. Furthermore, containment measures {{are included in the}} recent European Union <b>F-Gas</b> regulation 517 / 2014. In this paper a thermodynamic screening of single-component refrigerants, such as HFCs, HFOs, HCs, CO 2, and their binary blends are considered in an ideal vapour compression refrigeration cycle operating with application temperatures appropriate for truck refrigeration systems. Based on the thermodynamic screening, the three promising options, in terms of Coefficient of Performance (COP) and of Volumetric Cooling Capacity (VCC), are selected for further analysis using an advanced simulation model in order to compare their performances with R 404 A in a typical European truck refrigeration system. The estimated COP and VCC are compared and strategies for improving the energetic performance of the refrigeration system are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{cumulative}} consequences of climate change, global concentration {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) must be reduced; being inequality in per-capita emissions levels a problem to achieve a commitment by all countries. Thus, the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions inequality {{has received special attention}} because CO 2 is the most abundant GHG in the atmosphere. However, it is necessary to consider other gases to provide a real illustration of our starting point to achieve a multilateral agreement. In this paper, we study the evolution of global inequality in GHGs emissions during the period 1990 – 2011, considering the four main gases: CO 2, methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and fluorinated gases (<b>F-gases).</b> The data used in this analysis is taken from the World Resources Institute (2014) and the groups of countries are constructed according to the quantity of emissions that each country released into the atmosphere {{in the first year of}} study. For this purpose we use the multidimensional generalized entropy measures proposed by Maasoumi (1986) that can be decomposable into the between- and within-group inequality components. The biggest fall in inequality is observed when we attach more weight to the emissions transfers between the most polluting countries and assume a low substitution degree among pollutants. Finally, some economic policy implications are commented...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the GAINS model methodology for the 2016 Reference scenario for emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigation potentials and {{costs in the}} EU- 28 with projections to 2050. The non-CO 2 emission scenarios form {{part of the work}} under the EUCLIMIT 2 project 1. The project aims at producing projections for all emissions of GHGs in the EU- 28 consistent with the macroeconomic and population projections presented in EC/DG ECFIN (2015). Four modelling groups were involved in the work: PRIMES (National Technical University of Athens), CAPRI (Bonn University), GLOBIOM (IIASA-ESM program) and GAINS (IIASA-MAG program). This report focuses on describing the methodology of the GAINS model for the estimation of the non-CO 2 GHGs, i. e., methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and three groups of fluorinated gases (<b>F-gases)</b> viz. hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). The report is structured as follows. Section 2 {{presents the}} general GAINS methodology for estimating draft non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions for EU- 28. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe in detail the methodology applied for estimation of emissions by source for CH 4, N 2 O and Fgases, respectively. Finally, Section 6 provides a comparison between emissions reported by member states to the UNFCCC for years 2005 and 2010 and the emissions estimated by the GAINS model for the same years...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{effectiveness}} of climate policy requires monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of policy measures. Also the EU requires that the member states should every two years report their implemented measures to the European Commission according to the Decision 280 / 2004 /EC. This report studies the ex-ante and ex-post evaluations of climate policies implemented in the EU countries. The focus is especially on policies related to buildings, waste and <b>F-gases.</b> The objective {{of the study is}} to encourage sharing experiences of evaluations between countries and thus increase the transparency and cost-efficiency of the evaluations. The study addresses e. g. what kind of criteria and methods have been used in the evaluations, what kind of data has been utilised and what kind of limitations have been brought up in the evaluations. The need to renew the evaluation and reporting of climate policy measures has been recognised both at the EU – and member state level. The European Commission has proposed replacing the current Decision 280 / 2004 /EC with a decree that would oblige member states to report about their policy measures yearly in more detail than currently. The results of this report are reflected against the Commission’s proposal. Based on this report, a clearer distinction should be made between regular, routine-like reporting and research-based evaluations. The report concludes that regular reporting should be restricted to standardised data that is relatively easily available. At the same time, the need to undertake periodic, more in-depth and research-based evaluations, can be emphasised...|$|R
