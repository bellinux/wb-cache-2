500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

Upon making this announcement, den Adel said: [...] "By releasing these demos we want to invite you in our home studio and show how we capture song ideas {{at an early stage}} of creating a new album. These demo versions are far from their final sound on the album, but will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of what we’re working on. It will be fascinating to hear how the end result will sound like, once the album is released.". After announcing that the lead single would contain a guest musician, on September 13 the band officially announced that Tarja Turunen was set to appear as a special vocalist on the title song. The EP was released on September 27. On 25 and 26 October, den Adel and Westerholt presented an unknown number of songs of the upcoming album to the press.

6000|$|... "Hush! not a {{word about}} it," [...] said the Antiquary. [...] "I <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> before--I will possess you more fully hereafter--I promise <b>you,</b> there is <b>a</b> secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you no clue?" [...] I asked. [...] "Was {{there no}} mark of violence, no blood-stain, no foot-prints, nothing to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{as to what}} kind of danger {{you may have to}} meet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are wiser {{not to ask}} that" [...] she said. [...] "It is one {{of those}} cases where {{knowledge}} means death. But I can at least <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b> Have you any influence at all with any member of your government?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same here, old man," [...] said Rawlins, {{extending}} {{his hand as}} he appeared from a hurried conference with the old woman at the woodshed, [...] "and trust to Zeenie to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> ef there's anythin' underhanded goin' on. So long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard {{down out}} of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service-- don't {{aggravate}} me--I won't have it. But let us understand each other. I have <b>given</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> about what whaling is! do ye yet feel inclined for it?" ...|$|R

5000|$|The track couldn't be used {{on their}} first {{full-length}} CD [...] "Product". It was re-recorded as [...] "Get On The Floor" [...] as the replacement track.

6000|$|And to Mary it was, [...] "Let me <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> my dear Mrs Carbonel. The Duchess saw you in Poppleby, {{and asked}} who you were, {{and she said}} she would like to visit you, if you did not live in such a hole." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I took {{an early}} {{opportunity}} of <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b> From some words of Mr. Hersheimmer's at Manchester, I gathered {{that you had}} understood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me, what I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer's possession----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} {{entrance}} to it,--the way you came, and that is guarded too. From the time you entered it until you reached the bottom, you were signaled here from point to point! HE would have been dropped! I merely <b>gave</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{of what might have}} happened to you, if you were up to any little game! You took it like a white man. Come, now! What is your business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> wait <b>a</b> bit {{and let me}} finish! Well, I {{might have}} come now and then, found out what I could, and <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> or two, until we saw how {{things were going to}} be. But that's not my way, and I reckon it's not yours. Very well. We have got to have a talk and put the thing over. To begin with, I somehow feel I can trust you, and needn't be disturbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you?" [...] Ralph answered. [...] "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over what you told me, Austen, and I fancy, perhaps, I can <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b> Do you know that at the present moment the two most powerful battleships {{in the world are}} being built on the Tyne for Brazil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} only too happy," [...] {{returned}} the youth, sitting down again to his sketch, [...] "and perhaps I {{may be able}} to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> or two-- especially in reference to perspective--for I've had regular training, you know, Kathy, and I dare say you have not had that here." ...|$|E
60|$|But before I say a {{word about}} this school, I shall go back to where I should have begun, and <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> as to who I am; for it may be that these words of mine may be read by some folk beyond the border country who never heard of the Calders of West Inch.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! There's trouble enough, the Lord knows; but there's {{nothing else}} to tell you. I suppose Pen <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> about it. I dropped {{something}} to her. I've been feeling bad about it, Persis, a good while, but I hain't had the heart to speak of it. I can't expect you to say you like it. I've been a fool, I'll allow, and I've been something worse, {{if you choose to}} say so; but that's all. I haven't hurt anybody but myself--and you and the children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This man," [...] he began, nodding feebly at the corpse--"O'Brien {{were his}} name--a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning for to sail her back. Well, he's dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and who's to sail this ship I don't see. Without I <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> <b>you</b> ain't that man, as far's I can tell.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir James, still smiling, [...] "without prejudice, then, if I had a young sister {{forced to}} earn her living, I should {{not like to}} see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer's service. I felt it {{incumbent}} on me just to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b> It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Robertson," [...] I said, [...] "I wish to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to {{be passed}} on to Mr. Thomaso, if that is he. He spoke of the Zulu soldier there as a nigger, etc. Well, he is a chief of a high rank and rather a terrible fellow if roused. Therefore I {{recommend}} Mr. Thomaso not to let him understand that he is insulting him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} his companion, [...] "that's a point I'm {{not quite sure}} about. <b>You</b> only hold <b>a</b> provisional charter to lower the river. There's only one unworked holding near the valley, and, as you couldn't injure anybody's property, we permitted you to go ahead. Still, if any parties supplied us with a sufficient reason for withdrawing that permission, {{we might have to}} listen to them." [...] He broke off for a moment and waved his hand. [...] "Of course, I'm not speaking officially. I'm merely <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that may be useful. Some persons might take up that land with the object of putting the screw on you. You see, {{it would be possible to}} get over any difficulty they might raise by buying them out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if they {{supplied}} <b>a</b> want <b>you</b> didn't feel. You {{seem to be}} fond of books, {{and after}} a while you'll be wanting to lend them yourself. I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little <b>hint</b> that I'm too old to profit by: remember that <b>you</b> can lend <b>a</b> person more books in a day than he can read in a week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} kind, child. Since {{you are so}} wise, could <b>you</b> <b>give</b> me <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> how I'd better 'speak up', as you elegantly express it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. In this my {{relation}} of the merciful working of God upon my soul, {{it will not be}} amiss, if, in the first place, I do, in a few words, <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of my pedigree, and manner of bringing up; that thereby the goodness and bounty of God towards me, may be the more advanced and magnified before the sons of men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{seeing it}} was not what you may call an {{everyday}} sort of affair, and as perhaps the yarn might <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> as might be useful {{to you if you}} ever gets into the same kind of fix, I don't mind if I tell you. Just at present I have not finished my work, but if you and the other two young gents like to come forward here at six bells I will tell you about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What {{is right}} to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> Frank; any want of {{attention}} to her here should be carefully avoided. You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call early {{it will be a}} slight." ...|$|E

"Natur' <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> how to conduct," [...] {{observed}} Joel, {{pointing out}} this circumstance to his principal companions, {{as they all}} lay peering over the upper portions of the stack, at the Hut. [...] "You see them men under the eaves--they're a plaguy sight safer up there, than we be down here; and; if 'twere'n't for {{the look of the}} thing, I wish I was with 'em. That house will never be taken without a desperate sight of fightin'; for the captain is an old warrior, and seems to like to snuff gunpowder"--the reader will understand none knew of the veteran's death but those in the house--"and won't be for givin' up while he has a charge left. If I had twenty men--no, thirty would be better, where these fellows be, I think the place could be carried in a few minutes, and then liberty would get its rights, and your monarchy-men would be put down as they all desarve." ...|$|R
