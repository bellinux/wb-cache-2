60|$|The priest {{looked down}} at me with a puzzled {{expression}} in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|His pause was significant. He grinned, and <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> {{danced with}} a kind of wild humor.|$|E
60|$|Mr MacGinnis {{began to}} rumble, preparatory to making further {{remarks on the}} situation, but Sam waved him down and turned <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> inquiringly on me.|$|E
60|$|Ezra Jennings {{looked at}} me, {{with a sudden}} flash of {{interest}} in <b>his</b> dreamy <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{took a few}} {{turns up}} and down the room, then {{suddenly}} stepped aside to a table in a corner on which his writing materials were placed. [...] "I was not born yesterday, ma'am!" [...] said the captain, speaking jocosely to himself. He winked <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eye,</b> took up <b>his</b> pen, and wrote the answer.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me with the sad smile on his lips, and the kindly {{interest}} in <b>his</b> soft <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am honored," [...] {{returned}} Geoffrey, with {{a little}} bow. There was a grateful look in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> which did not quail in the slightest under the lady's scrutiny.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{a matter}} upon which I will not dispute with a guest," [...] said Cavalcanti with an urbanity of tone belied by the anger that flashed from <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "As a woman, madam," [...] {{said the}} president, letting <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> slip {{for a moment}} from Miss Marsh's corn-colored crest over her {{straight}} but scant figure down to her smart slippers.|$|E
60|$|Alwyn lifted <b>his</b> soft <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> reverently and said, 'It is {{something}} good,' speaking, {{as he always}} did, in a baby lisp inimitable here.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} tall hat. <b>His</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eye</b> twinkled, <b>his</b> green eye twinkled, his curly lips smiled sweetly. In {{a moment he}} turned on his heel. His {{youthful}} back appeared to the best advantage; his active little legs took him away trippingly {{in the direction of}} the village. One, two, three--and he reached the turn in the road. Four, five, six--and he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Lambeth {{looked at}} her a little with <b>his</b> {{handsome}} <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "Do you suppose he would have come down with us if we had urged him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{noted the}} {{fleeting}} bafflement in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> He answered slowly and thoughtfully, as if {{working out a}} difficult problem. [...] "I reckon, then, I'd have to choke you and maul you some bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Gyp {{stood looking}} down. Would it be relief to pour her soul out? Would it? <b>His</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> {{questioned}} her {{like an old}} dog's. She {{did not want to}} hurt one so kind. And yet--impossible! ...|$|E
60|$|He came in cheerily, his hearty voice ringing {{with health}} and good-will. He {{took her hand}} in his with a quick, strong grip, and the light of <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> brought a glow to her heart.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Kelmscott {{straightened}} himself up, {{and looked}} hard at his son. A terrible pathos gleamed in <b>his</b> proud <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>His</b> white moustache had more dignity than ever.|$|R
60|$|Bradley sat silently {{looking at}} her with <b>his</b> big <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> He was thrilling with the {{vibration}} of her voice and the touch of {{her hand on his}} arm.|$|R
60|$|Dumps wagged {{his tail}} vigorously; whether at the news, {{or because of}} {{pleasure}} at my brushing the hair off <b>his</b> soft <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> and looking into them, I cannot tell.|$|R
60|$|When he had {{a moment}} of absence, {{he looked up from}} the table and said good-morning to Ursula. There was a {{pleasant}} light in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> He seemed very manly and incontrovertible, like something she wanted to push over.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Renshaw opened <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> upon her. Was he mistaken? {{was this}} romantic girl {{only a little}} coquette playing her provincial airs on him? [...] "You say he and your father didn't agree? That means, I suppose, that YOU and he agreed?--and that was the result." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sharpened}} a green stick, and, {{taking some}} strips of meat from his pocket, roasted {{them over the}} hot flame. He fed the dog first. Mose had crouched close {{on the ground with}} his head on his paws, and <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> fastened upon the hunter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me this, then," [...] the Duke said, <b>his</b> clear <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed {{steadily}} upon Cecil's miserable white face. [...] "Were {{there any}} unusual circumstances at all connected with his leaving here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon you've {{got that}} cougar chained in your cabin door?" [...] queried Beasley, {{and there was}} a barely {{distinguishable}} shudder of his muscular frame. Also the pupils dilated in <b>his</b> hard <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he murmured, [...] "she {{was fine}} all over!" [...] He had dropped his eyeglasses, and <b>his</b> full <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> with little crow's-feet at the corners, wandered from his visitor to his cigar.|$|R
60|$|The Angel {{seemed to}} become aware of his {{presence}} for the first time. He raised himself by one hand, <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> stared into the Vicar's. Then, with a gasp, and biting his nether lip, he struggled into a sitting position and surveyed the Vicar from top to toe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Terry, it {{is a new}} phase, and a most perplexing one!" [...] said Rosamond, {{when her}} brother came back with arch curiosity in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "The girl has gone and turned him over, and there he lies on his back prostrate, just like Ponto, when he knows he deserves it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I observe no difference, {{which is}} what you would say," [...] Fortunio {{answered}} truculently, his head well back, <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> resentful of offence--for none can be so resentful of imputed villainy as your villain who is thorough-paced. [...] "And," [...] he concluded, [...] "I return you the same answer, madame--that I am no cut-throat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is God dead?" [...] asked {{a startled}} little {{voice from the}} doorway of the living-room. Jims stood there, flushed from sleep, <b>his</b> big <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> filled with dread, [...] "Oh Willa--oh, Willa, is God dead?" ...|$|R
60|$|The man's {{long face}} {{suddenly}} grew longer. <b>His</b> bilious <b>brown</b> <b>eye</b> looked disconcerted, and his bilious green eye followed its example. His manner became palpably anxious; and {{his choice of}} words was more carefully selected than ever.|$|R
60|$|His voice {{told me that}} {{he spoke}} sincerely. <b>His</b> soft <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> rested on me for a moment with a look of melancholy interest. He bowed, and went, without another word, {{on his way to the}} village.|$|R
6000|$|When {{first we}} met, {{he really was}} [...] "as bonny as a girlie"; with his oval face, his flushed cheeks, <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> large and radiant, and his hair of a length more romantic than conventional. He wore a wide blue cloak, with a grace which hovered between that of an Italian poet and an early pirate.|$|E
60|$|Sir John Dory--Chief Commissioner of Scotland Yard, {{a person}} of weight and importance--had changed a great deal {{during the last few}} years. His hair had become grey, his walk more dignified. There was the briskness, however, of his best days in his carriage, and in the flash of <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> He held out his hand to his ancient foe with a smile.|$|E
60|$|She endeavoured {{to quell}} Steve with a glance, {{but it was}} {{instantly}} apparent that he was immune {{for the time being}} to quelling glances. <b>His</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> were fixed upon her in a cold stare which she found arresting and charged with menace. His chin protruded and his upper lip was entirely concealed behind its fellow in a most uncomfortable manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am, sir," [...] {{replied the}} soft-voiced giant turning and {{looking down on}} the {{stranger}} with an amused twinkle in <b>his</b> deep <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> He stood as erect as an Indian, though his hair and beard were white.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evenin', miss; {{beautiful}} evenin', ma'am!" [...] And <b>his</b> little burning <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> just {{touched by}} age, regarded her lovingly.|$|R
6000|$|Jims {{chose this}} moment for waking up. He opened <b>his</b> big <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and looked at}} Mrs. Matilda Pitman unblinkingly. Then he sat up, dimpled deliciously, pointed {{to her and said}} solemnly to Rilla, [...] "Pwitty lady, Willa, pwitty lady." ...|$|R
