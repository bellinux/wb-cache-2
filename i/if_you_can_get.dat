500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's {{family members}} to devote some {{publishing}} rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E

GameDaily named Rufus the strangest {{of the new}} characters introduced in Street Fighter IV, placing him 12th on their [...] "Most Bizarre Fighting Characters" [...] list and noting his high attack speed despite his weight. IGN described Rufus {{as one of the}} most interesting new characters introduced in the title, due to the [...] "juxtaposition between his comical size and impressive speed" [...] and added that his attack set [...] "shows that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> past Rufus' comical exterior, a capable fighter hides within." [...] IGN AU stated that while they felt the character was the ugliest in the game, they enjoyed his unpredictability and acrobatics, as well as his attitude. 1UP.com called Rufus a worthy addition to the series, [...] "despite...outward, me-too appearances". Anime News Network described Rufus as well-designed and engaging, despite initial reservations regarding the character. VideoGamer.com praised Rufus as one of the game's better new characters in the title, in heavy contrast to other additions such as Crimson Viper. GameTrailers praised the character and noted he [...] "definitely offered something different", adding [...] "You may not have expected a game's most obvious jiggle physics to apply to a male character."

500|$|Vikram then {{featured}} in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, {{inspired by the}} ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, with Vikram featuring as the tribal leader, Veeraiya, in the Tamil version and the cop, Dev Pratap Sharma, in the Hindi version of the films which were shot simultaneously. Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai also in the cast. Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously but revealed he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another. Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language remarking jovially it was the [...] "most difficult thing in the world". After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one earning 20 crores. The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics with The Hindu calling it a [...] "masterstroke" [...] and claiming Vikram [...] "raises the bar higher with every venture". The critic cited that [...] "emotions of love, animus, anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession", concluding that [...] "Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level". The critic from Sify labelled it as a [...] "astonishing portrayal", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's [...] "ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction". The Tamil version consequently {{went on to become}} a commercial success, with Vikram's performance leading to him winning the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor among other accolades. In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's. Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said [...] "Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana– <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> past the lead performances, that is" [...] whereas Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1.5/5 and said, [...] "On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content" [...] though mentioning that Vikram was [...] "first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough". Raavan subsequently {{went on to become a}} surprise flop at the Indian box office. The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival, with Vikram in attendance.|$|E
