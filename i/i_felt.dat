5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> really disappointed, I {{believed in}} the record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|But at {{that same}} moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only I could {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that I could use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
5|$|But now, I {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was a bit}} peeved {{about not}} getting credit {{for a couple of}} songs, but that wasn't the whole reason left the band. I guess <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> like <b>I</b> had enough. I decided to leave and start a group with Jack Bruce. <b>I</b> never really <b>felt,</b> and <b>I</b> don't know why, but <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was gonna stay with the Stones forever, even right from the beginning. Mick Taylor, in an {{interview}} with Gary James ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth smiled {{somewhat}} inanely. [...] "I don't know; <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had to. All of us {{are subject}} to little weaknesses occasionally." ...|$|R
6000|$|She whitened {{and said}} nothing. <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> must plead with her. [...] "Damn these bandages!" [...] I said, breaking into ineffectual febrile rage.|$|R
5|$|I did it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all my power, because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.|$|E
5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and I could look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
2500|$|... "When I was healthy, <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could score", McHale {{once told}} reporters. [...] "When {{it went into}} what I called 'The torture chamber,' I knew it was in." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> {{was between}} the devil and the deep sea. There was no {{avoiding}} the issue, and so, out of this all-embracing, all-compelling conviction of truth, I spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{said the}} {{agitated}} Peer, [...] "you cannot speak too boldly. My mind opens to you. <b>I</b> have <b>felt,</b> <b>I</b> have long <b>felt,</b> that <b>I</b> {{was not what}} I ought to be, that I was not what society requires me to be; but where is your remedy? what is the line of conduct that I should pursue?" ...|$|R
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> hate <b>felting</b> and {{touching}} the wool.|$|R
6000|$|Mistress Affery negatived {{each with}} a shake of her head. 'No, Jeremiah; <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> it before. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> it up-stairs, and once on the {{staircase}} as I was going from her room to ours in the night--a rustle and a sort of trembling touch behind me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton laughed. [...] "I really don't quite know. <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had to," [...] he {{said with}} a naive simplicity. [...] "I wouldn't have done it if I had thought it would vex you." ...|$|R
5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she admitted, hesitatingly. [...] "You don't {{seem to me}} {{as though}} you cared to make friends very easily. <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> wanted to ask you. Have you ever been engaged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> {{very little}} but weariness and want of energy; but I am {{better now than}} <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> for weeks. And what is more, Cherry, I don't feel like getting worse. I mean to set myself to live {{to get through the}} work my father left me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope you're not frightfully sick about it?" [...] {{he said at}} length. [...] "It {{was lying}} about, you know, and <b>I</b> rather <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> must have it. Hadn't the cheek to ask you for it, so..." ...|$|R
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> {{this way}} before, with Elina Vasiltchikova (2005) ...|$|R
60|$|I made no reply. <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{the rope}} {{in my hands}} growing tighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything," [...] said Mr. Skelmersdale, [...] "just who she was, {{and where}} she lived, and {{everything}} about her. <b>I</b> sort of <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> 'ad to all the time, I did." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{told people}} the {{complete}} opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so bad. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so bad. I never lied again after that.|$|E
25|$|I {{approached}} {{the problem of}} induction through Hume. Hume, <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
60|$|She smiled, {{none too}} well pleased. <b>I</b> somehow <b>felt</b> she {{suspected}} us of suspecting her.|$|R
5000|$|... "She {{was closely}} {{attentive}} and tough, but <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> manhandled by her." [...] —Nicholas Delbanco ...|$|R
60|$|Trick. You shall feel no where: <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> {{already and}} am {{sure they are}} lost.|$|R
