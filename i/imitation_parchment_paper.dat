40|$|Intoduction: Sterile gauze {{is one of}} {{the medical}} devices that are often used to prevent infection. Several things, one of them is {{materials}} for packaging, can affect the sterility of gauze. <b>Parchment</b> <b>paper</b> {{is one of the}} packaging materials for sterilization. The study was done to analyze the sterility of gauze packed with <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> one layer and three layers on the growth of microorganism. Method: This study was an experimental study with a quasi-experimental design. Samples were 60 gauze packed with one layer <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> and 60 gauze packed with three layers of <b>parchment</b> <b>paper.</b> The sterility of sterile gauze tested at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the sterility of gauze packed with 1 layer of <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> on the growth of microorganisms at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 126). No significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze packed with 3 layers of <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 675). There was a significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze packed with <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers on the growth of microorganisms (p = 0. 002). Conclusion There is a significant difference of sterile gauze packed with <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers against the growth of microorganisms. The sterility of the packaged sterile gauze with a layer of <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> is better than the three layers...|$|R

5000|$|En papillote ( [...] ; French for [...] "in parchment"), or al cartoccio in Italian, is {{a method}} of cooking in which the food is put into a folded pouch or parcel and then baked.

The pocket is created by overlapping circles of aluminum foil and <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> and then folding them tightly around the food to create a seal. A papillote should be opened at the table {{to allow people to}} smell the aroma when it opens.|$|R

25|$|Vegetable (<b>paper)</b> <b>parchment</b> is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the {{hydrolysis}} of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|R

50|$|Modern <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> is made {{by running}} sheets of paper pulp through a bath of sulfuric acid (a method similar to how tracing paper is made) or {{sometimes}} zinc chloride. This process partially dissolves or gelatinizes the paper. This treatment forms a sulfurized cross-linked material with high density, stability, and heat resistance, and low surface energy—thereby imparting good non-stick or release properties. The treated paper has an appearance {{similar to that of}} traditional parchment, and because of its stability is sometimes used for legal purposes where traditional parchment was used.|$|R
