5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century. His thoughts on Shakespeare's plays as a whole (particularly the tragedies), his discussions of certain characters such as Shylock, Falstaff, Imogen, Caliban and Iago and his ideas {{about the nature of}} drama and poetry in general, such as expressed in the <b>essay</b> <b>on</b> Coriolanus, gained renewed appreciation and influenced other Shakespearean criticism.|$|E
5|$|In 1743, Smart {{pushed his}} {{translation}} of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum {{and paid for}} the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's <b>Essay</b> <b>on</b> Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An <b>Essay</b> <b>on</b> Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E

5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An <b>Essay</b> <b>on</b> the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E
5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an <b>essay</b> <b>on</b> how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.|$|E
5|$|Born, raised, {{and educated}} in Los Angeles, Kemp {{was the third}} of four sons of Frances Elizabeth (née Pope) and Paul Robert Kemp Sr. Paul turned his {{motorcycle}} messenger service into a trucking company that grew from one to 14 trucks. Frances was a well-educated social worker and Spanish teacher. Kemp {{grew up in the}} heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles, but his tight-knit middle-class family attended the Church of Christ, Scientist. In his youth, sports consumed Kemp, who once chose the forward pass as the subject of a school <b>essay</b> <b>on</b> important inventions, although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page <b>essay</b> <b>on</b> Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in his <b>essay</b> <b>on</b> the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as}} his own measurements {{to propose}} that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
5|$|Due in part {{to these}} {{personal}} trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his <b>essay</b> <b>On</b> Instructions to Representatives, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.|$|E
