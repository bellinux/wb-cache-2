5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{mentioned}} by either of his earliest biographers, Baldinucci or Domenico Bernini, the Elephant and Obelisk is a sculpture {{located near the}} Pantheon, in the Piazza della Minerva, {{in front of the}} Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope Alexander VII decided that he wanted a small ancient Egyptian obelisk (that was discovered beneath the piazza) to be erected on the same site, and in 1665 he commissioned Bernini to create a sculpture to support the obelisk. The sculpture of an elephant bearing the obelisk on its back was executed by one of Bernini's students, Ercole Ferrata, upon a design by his master, and finished in 1667. An inscription on the base relates the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddess Minerva to the Virgin Mary, who supposedly supplanted those pagan goddesses and to whom the church is dedicated. A popular anecdote concerns the elephant's smile. To find out why it <b>is</b> <b>smiling,</b> legend has it, the viewer must examine the rear end of the animal and notice that its muscles are tensed and its tail is shifted to the left as if it were defecating. The animal's rear is pointed directly at one of the headquarters of the Dominican Order, housing the offices of its Inquisitors as well as the office of Father Giuseppe Paglia, a Dominican friar {{who was one of the}} main antagonists of Bernini, as a final salute and last word.|$|E
500|$|Sugiyama {{has stated}} that Sasuke's line [...] "you are annoying" [...] sums up Sasuke's {{feelings}} towards Sakura. He is initially annoyed by her, yet when he repeats it before leaving Konohagakure, he <b>is</b> <b>smiling.</b> Naruto's voice actor, Junko Takeuchi, remarked that Sasuke's line [...] "See you next time… Thank you," [...] addressed to Sakura, revealed his feeling for her. Sugiyama noted that by the end, Sasuke realized how much he hurt Sakura's feelings across the series, and apologized to her after his final fight against Naruto. In preparations for the film , Sugiyama expected to see a bond between Sasuke and his student, Boruto. For the Boruto anime series, Sugiyama noted {{a major change in}} Sasuke's personality and he wanted fans to see the character's interaction with his family.|$|E

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head9 is {{also known}} as San Lorenzo Monument66. It {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep. The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the gullies at San Lorenzo; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards, half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream. Although it was documented by archaeologists, it remained for some time in its place of discovery before being moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. The headdress is of a single piece without a distinct headband. The sides display features that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailing {{to the bottom of the}} monument. The earflares are rectangular plates with an additional trapezoid element at the front. The head is also depicted wearing a nose-ring. The face <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> and has wrinkles under the eyes and at the edge of the mouth. It has sagging cheeks and wide eyes. The mouth is closed and the upper lip is badly damaged. The sculpture suffered some mutilation in antiquity, with nine pits hollowed into the face and headdress.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a closed caption that reads [...] "Britney Spears – Stronger", amidst {{the sound of a}} storm. It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, [...] "Whatever," [...] to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an {{apparent}} semi-futuristic world, having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style chair in front of a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on {{the very edge of the}} bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed from the chair, are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, [...] "few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'". The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson's {{painting}} shows Serota, {{the director}} of the Tate gallery. He <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> behind a large pair of red knickers on a washing line, saying [...] "is it a genuine Emin (£10,000)" [...] and thinking, [...] "or a worthless fake?". This is a reference to Tracey Emin's My Bed, literally a display of her (dishevelled) bed with detritus which included a pair of her knickers, shown in the 1999 Turner Prize at Tate Britain. [...] The image was painted over a few days and in a final 24-hour non stop stint.|$|E

2500|$|Hassan {{explained}} that when Silas realises Lynsey {{is trying to}} bring him down again he [...] "basically tells her to bring it on". She continued saying that Silas [...] "gets off" [...] {{on the idea that}} Lynsey is trying to prevent him from killing again as it makes his game more interesting. Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) portrays her murdered sister, India (Beth Kingston), in a reconstruction of India's death. The actress {{explained that}} during the campaign Lynsey notices Silas <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> and [...] "his eyes are full of glee while Texas is clearly in turmoil" [...] reconfirming her earlier suspicions that Silas killed India. Lynsey steals India's necklace from Texas and plants it on Silas before calling the polie with an anonymous tip-off. Hassan revealed that Lynsey does this in the hope that Silas' lies will unravel, explaining that now Lynsey has [...] "entered into this game of cat-and-mouse with Silas, she'll get deeper and deeper".|$|E
