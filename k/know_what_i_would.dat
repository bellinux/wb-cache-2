Ronnie Spector told Symes: [...] "For four years Phil and I completely detached ourselves from everyone {{in the business and}} settled down in California.

Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E

[...] Monique Marcil of Zap2it said that the [...] "28 seconds of silence between co-workers Jim and Pam capture all the awkwardness and longing of unspoken love better than any words could.
