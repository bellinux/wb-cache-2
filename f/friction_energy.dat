2500|$|Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 {{model year}} vehicle, the RX 450h (GLV10/GLV15) premiered {{alongside}} its non-hybrid counterpart, the RX 350. Manufacturer's specifications indicated largely identical outward dimensions for the RX 450h with the RX 350. The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
50|$|When colliding objects do {{not have}} a {{direction}} of motion that is in-line with their centers of gravity and point of impact, or if their contact surfaces at that point are not perpendicular to that line, some energy that would have been available for the post-collision velocity difference will be lost to rotation and <b>friction.</b> <b>Energy</b> losses to vibration and the resulting sound are usually negligible.|$|E
50|$|A {{dissipator}} is {{a device}} mounted among some sections {{of a building}} to reduce strains during an earthquake by slowing down the shaking of the building. During an earthquake, the sections of the building are subjected to movements which are relative to each other (for instance, the relative movement between two different floors). When the structures oscillate, the dissipator devices, {{some of which are}} similar to pistons, slow down the vibration by dissipating viscous or <b>friction</b> <b>energy,</b> thus increasing the equivalent viscous coefficient and then reducing the strains on the structure itself.|$|E

We investigated {{the influence of}} geometric features of the damper on damping characteristics; and the geometric feature studied was the depth and length of the rectangular particle container. The work done by the frictional force between the particle layer {{and the effect of}} particle filling rate on the vibration damping characteristics was also explored. We analyzed the <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> dissipation model, and the relationship between the particle filling rate and the vibration damping. The experimental results show good agreement with the <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> dissipation model, which verifies the proposed simulation prediction. The results have shown that the particle damping technology can greatly consume the structure kinetic energy, and the vibration reduction effect of particle damping depends mainly on the interaction of the particles near the top.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{drive power}} in motor vehicles requires an improved performance of friction linings and counterpart material in clutches. The most important criteria are {{the coefficient of}} friction, the wear rate, the specific weight, the judder and noise inclination. The frictional heat developing during the engagement process leads to a high temperature load of the lining surface. So far organic friction linings are used preferentially because of their good comfort behaviour and low price. Their properties were improved continually over the last years. However their performance is limited especially by the transferable specific <b>friction</b> <b>energy.</b> Thus the evaluation of alternative friction materials is an important goal of the clutch manufacturers. For the investigations pin-on-disc tests with inertia simulation on different material couples were accomplished. The adjustable mass inertia of the system ensures a defined <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> per clutch procedure. This permits {{the evaluation of the}} friction value as a function of running speed and cycle number as well as the determination of the wear rate related to the performed <b>friction</b> <b>energy.</b> Additionally the noise emission was measured for the evaluation of the comfort behaviour.

40|$|Minimization of pumping {{energy is}} a major concern for {{designing}} sustainable water supply in buildings. Modular designs of tree-shaped water supply piping system, such as 2 by N array include water cisterns of water closet in public toilets, washbasin taps in schools are commonly found in building complexes. Potable water demands in water systems serving built environment are unsteady, random and intermittent. However, the existing statistical Hunter-based probabilistic approaches to pipe sizing, however, do not consider the minimization of pumping energy for water distribution through proper selection of pipe radii. This paper demonstrates a pipe sizing method with probabilistic demands for optimizing pipe <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> loss constrained by the fixed pipeline volume. A mathematical model for pumping energy optimization in infinite tree-shape water supply piping networks for probabilistic demands is proposed. Compared with the Hunter’s based probabilistic approach in sizing an 8 -section tree-shape water supply network for demand of probabilities 0. 1 and 0. 2, the proposed method offers reduction potentials of pipe <b>friction</b> <b>energy</b> loss of 12 % and 43 % respectively.
