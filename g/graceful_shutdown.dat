500|$|Two {{independent}} dual-CPU computers, A and B, {{form the}} controller; giving redundancy to the system. The failure of controller system A automatically {{leads to a}} switch-over to controller system B without impeding operational capabilities; the subsequent failure of controller system B would provide a <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown</b> of the engine. Within each system (A and B), the two M68000s operate in [...] "lock-step", thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing the signal levels on the buses of the two M68000 processors within that system. If differences are encountered between the two buses, then an interrupt is generated and control {{turned over to the}} other system. Because of subtle differences between M68000s from Motorola and the second source manufacturer TRW, each system uses M68000s from the same manufacturer (for instance system A would have two Motorola CPUs while system B would have two CPUs manufactured by TRW). Memory for block I controllers was of the plated-wire type, which functions {{in a manner similar to}} magnetic core memory and retains data even after power is turned off. Block II controllers used conventional CMOS static RAM.|$|E

40|$|Shutting down a link for the {{purposes}} of a scheduled routine maintenance does cause the forwarding path to change. If these changes are not done in a required order will cause not only transient micro loops but also an overload in some links. Currently, some ISP operators use a <b>graceful</b> link <b>shutdown</b> procedure by first setting up the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) link metric to MAX_METRIC - 1 and then shutdown the link. In this paper, we present a Pythagorean Triple Metric Sequence as a method to use to shutdown a link during such network operations. Conducting a link shutdown of any desired link for maintenance purpose is a very delicate duty that requires extreme care to prevent transient loops during such topological changes. We thus wish to demonstrate that there exists a Pythagorean Triple Metric Sequence for any given link {{that can be used to}} shutdown a link during the routine maintenance by ISPs...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the utility}} {{balancing}} approach and the 2016 SIA approach have the limitation that, if the approach succeeds and the superintelligence is completely indifferent {{to whether the}} kill switch is pressed or not, the superintelligence is also unmotivated to care {{one way or another}} about whether the kill switch remains functional, and could incidentally and innocently disable it in the course of its operations (for example, for the purpose of removing and recycling an [...] "unnecessary" [...] component). Similarly, if the superintelligence innocently creates and deploys superintelligent sub-agents, it will have no motivation to install human-controllable kill switches in the sub-agents. More broadly, the proposed architectures, whether weak or superintelligent, will in a sense [...] "act as if the kill switch can never be pressed" [...] and might therefore fail to make any contingency plans to arrange a <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown.</b> This could hypothetically create a practical problem even for a weak AI; by default, an AI designed to be safely interruptible might have difficulty understanding that it will be shut down for scheduled maintenance at 2 a.m. tonight and planning accordingly so that it won't be {{caught in the middle of}} a task during shutdown. The breadth of what types of architectures are or can be made SIA-compliant, as well as what types of counter-intuitive unexpected drawbacks each approach has, are currently under research.|$|E
40|$|MPLS-TE <b>Graceful</b> <b>Shutdown</b> is {{a method}} for {{explicitly}} notifying the nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE capability on a link or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) {{is going to be}} disabled. MPLS-TE <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown</b> mechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in the network. This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to reduce or eliminate traffic disruption {{in the event of a}} planned shutdown of a network resource. These operations are equally applicable to both MPLS-TE and its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extensions.

40|$|ARGES (Atmospheric Revitalization Group Expert System) is a {{demonstration}} prototype expert system for fault management for the Solid Amine, Water Desorbed (SAWD) CO 2 removal assembly, {{associated with the}} Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) System. ARGES monitors and reduces data in real time from either the SAWD controller or a simulation of the SAWD assembly. It can detect gradual degradations or predict failures. This allows <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown</b> and scheduled maintenance, which reduces crew maintenance overhead. Status and fault information is presented in a user interface that simulates what would be seen by a crewperson. The user interface employs animated color graphics and an object oriented approach to provide detailed status information, fault identification, and explanation of reasoning in a rapidly assimulated manner. In addition, ARGES recommends {{possible courses of action}} for predicted and actual faults. ARGES is seen as a forerunner of AI-based fault management systems for manned space systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes how}} Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) PathErr messages {{may be used}} to trigger rerouting of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point-to-point Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) without first removing LSP state or resources. Such LSP rerouting may be desirable in a number of cases, including, for example, soft-preemption and <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown.</b> This document describes the usage of existing Standards Track mechanisms to support LSP rerouting. In this case, it relies on mechanisms already defined as part of RSVP-TE and simply describes a sequence of actions to be executed. While existing protocol definitions can be used to support reroute applications, this document also defines a new reroute-specific error code to allow for the future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{is heavily}} used in Service Provider {{networks}} for both Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency purposes, redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed {{to reduce the}} consequences of an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) or BGP session breakdown on customers ’ or peers ’ traffic. However, simply taking down or even bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes may still induce connectivity losses during the BGP convergence. This is no longer satisfactory for new applications (e. g., voice over IP, online gaming, VPN). Therefore, a solution {{is required for the}} <b>graceful</b> <b>shutdown</b> of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount of traffic loss during a planned shutdown. This document expresses requirements for such a solution. Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
