When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American.

[...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her.
