25|$|A {{parasitic}} plant derives {{some or all}} of its nutritional requirements from another living plant. They make up about 1% of angiosperms and are in almost every biome in the world. All {{parasitic plant}}s have modified roots, named haustoria (singular: <b>haustorium),</b> which penetrate the host plants, connecting them to the conductive system – either the xylem, the phloem, or both. This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. Parasitic plants are classified depending on where the parasitic plant latches onto the host and the amount of nutrients it requires. Some parasitic plants are able to locate their host plants by detecting chemicals in the air or soil given off by host shoots or roots, respectively. About 4,500 species of parasitic plant in approximately 20 families of flowering plants are known.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{germination}} is stimulated, the Striga seed {{sends out}} an initial root {{to probe the}} soil for the host root. The initial root secretes an oxidizing enzyme that digests the host root surface, releasing quinones. [...] If the quinone product is within the appropriate concentrations, a <b>haustorium</b> will develop from the initial root. The <b>haustorium</b> grows toward the host root until it makes contact with the root surface, establishing parasitic contact in relatively short order. Within 12 hours of initial <b>haustorium</b> growth, the <b>haustorium</b> recognizes the host root and begins rapid cell division and elongation. [...] The <b>haustorium</b> forms a wedge shape and uses mechanical force and chemical digestion to penetrate the host root, pushing the host cells out of the way. [...] Within 48-72 hours, the <b>haustorium</b> has penetrated the host root cortex. [...] Finger-like structures on the <b>haustorium,</b> called oscula (from Latin osculum, [...] "little mouth") penetrate the host xylem through pits in the membrane. [...] The oscula then swell to secure their position within the xylem membrane. Striga sieve tubes develop along with the oscula. Shortly after the host xylem is penetrated, Striga sieve tubes develop and approach the host phloem within eight cells. [...] This eight cell layer allows for nonspecific nutrient transport from the host to the Striga seedling. [...] Within 24 hours after tapping the host xylem and phloem, the Striga cotyledons emerge from the seed.|$|E

50|$|A {{reliable}} characteristic for distinguishing Haustum <b>haustorium</b> {{from its}} congeners is the angle {{by which the}} aperture lip inserts on the shell: In Haustrum <b>haustorium</b> the angle is near-perpendicular, whereas in other species the angle is more acute (~45 degrees). Tan (2003) provides the most recent review.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{mistletoe}} {{plant is}} established on its host, {{it usually is}} possible to save a valuable branch by pruning and judicious removal of the wood invaded by the <b>haustorium,</b> if the infection is caught early enough. Some species of mistletoe can regenerate if the pruning leaves any of the <b>haustorium</b> alive in the wood.|$|E
50|$|Roots are {{adapted to}} a hemi-parasitic mechanism, utilising a <b>haustorium,</b> on roots {{able to reach}} out 10 metres to other root systems.|$|E
50|$|Haustrum <b>haustorium,</b> common name: {{the brown}} or dark rock shell, {{is a large}} species of predatory sea snail, a marine {{gastropod}} mollusc in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or rock snails.|$|E
50|$|Beechdrops parasitizes beech roots using a {{structure}} called a <b>haustorium</b> which collects all the nutrients {{that the plant}} uses in its life functions. It is not believed that the plant significantly harms beech trees.|$|E
50|$|Haustrum <b>haustorium</b> {{used to be}} {{the only}} species in the genus Haustrum. However, Beu (2004) {{reclassified}} a number of New Zealand's whelks, considering species in the genus Lepsiella to be synonymous with the genus Haustrum.|$|E
50|$|When a {{conditioned}} seed {{receives a}} chemical signal from a host plant, it germinates, forming a germ tube which grows toward the host. From this germ tube, it grows a <b>haustorium.</b> The <b>haustorium</b> {{is the part}} of the broomrape which attaches the parasite to the host and grows into the host’s vascular system. The parasite is then able to draw out water and nutrients from its host. At this point, O. aegyptiaca grows rapidly, developing above-ground flower stalks. The flowers develop between February through May. A medium-sized plant can produce more than 400 flowers, which each produce around 500 seeds. The complete life cycle of this parasite, if completed in one season, lasts 10 to 15 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Mistletoe is {{the common}} name for most obligate hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales. Mistletoes attach to and {{penetrate}} {{the branches of a}} tree or shrub by a structure called the <b>haustorium,</b> through which they absorb water and nutrients from the host plant.|$|E
50|$|After seeds germinate, {{they produce}} a <b>haustorium</b> or root-like {{structures}} that penetrate the host to extract water and minerals. This endophytic portion {{results in a}} challenging control problem because treatments must kill the outer ectophytic portion of the plant {{as well as the}} endophytic portion without damaging the host.|$|E
50|$|The spores {{that landed}} on the plant {{germinate}} and as hyphae grow {{on the outside of}} the host into masses known as mycelium, they also form appressoria in order to penetrate the host cells. After entering, the hyphae form a <b>haustorium</b> which allows them to absorb nutrients through the plasma membrane of the host cell.|$|E
50|$|In plants, suspensors {{are found}} in zygotes in angiosperms, {{connecting}} the endosperm to an embryo. Usually in dicots the suspensor cells divide transversally {{a few times to}} form a filamentous suspensor of 6-10 cells. The suspensor helps in pushing the embryo into the endosperm. The first cell of the suspensor towards the micropylar end becomes swollen and functions as a <b>haustorium.</b> The <b>haustorium</b> has wall ingrowths similar to those of a transfer cell. The last of the suspensors {{at the end of the}} embryo is known as hypophysis. Hypophysis later gives rise to the radicle and root cap. During embryo development in angiosperm seeds, normal development involves asymmetrical division of the unicellular embryo, inducing polarity. The smaller terminal cell divides to become the proembryo while the larger basal cell divides laterally to form the suspensor. The suspensor is analogous to a placental mammalian's umbilical cord.|$|E
50|$|If weather {{conditions}} are favorable, such as warm temperatures, sporangia infect directly via germ tubes. Germ tubes {{give rise to}} appressorium which form <b>haustorium</b> and allow the pathogen to extract nutrients without penetrating the host’s cell membrane. As a result, more sporangia are formed and if {{weather conditions}} remain favorable, additional sporangia are produced and infection continues {{either directly or indirectly}} on other hosts.|$|E

50|$|Cuscuta californica is a {{parasitic}} vine which climbs {{other plants}} and takes nutrition directly from them via a <b>haustorium.</b> The dodder resembles {{a pile of}} yellow-orange straw wrapped tightly around its host plant. It is mostly stem; the leaves are reduced to scales on the stem's surface, since they are not needed for photosynthesis while the dodder is obtaining nutrients from its host. It bears tiny white flowers which are only about 3 millimeters wide, and fruits which are even smaller.|$|E
50|$|Plants are {{typically}} autotrophic organisms {{meaning that they}} synthesise their own 'food' from inorganic compounds by photosynthesis. Some plants however are unable to synthesise their own 'food' by photosynthesis and therefore acquire nutrients by parasitic nutrition from other living plants. Plants which acquire their nutrients in this way are known as parasitic plants. These plants have modified root structures known as <b>haustorium,</b> which the parasitic plants use to penetrate the vascular bundle of host plants and essentially 'steal' nutrients from host plants.|$|E
50|$|Some plants {{may have}} subaerial roots, either totally (epiphytic {{plants such as}} some orchids) or more {{commonly}} only partly so. The oil palm tree can grow roots in loose leaves partly decayed on the ground's surface; these roots {{are said to be}} subaerial. Epiphyte plants growing above ground that do not feed from their tree support (for example through their <b>haustorium</b> or feeding part having dug into the tree, such as Mistletoe) have subaerial roots (for example some Ficus species).|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} no stems, leaves or true roots. It is a {{holoparasite}} of vines in the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae), spreading its absorptive organ, the <b>haustorium,</b> inside the tissue of the vine. The {{only part of}} the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petalled flower. In some species, such as Rafflesia arnoldii, the flower may be over 100 cm in diameter, and weigh up to 10 kg. Even one of the smallest species, R. baletei, has 12 cm diameter flowers.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} {{pathogenesis}} to occur, a viable pathogen, susceptible host, and conducive environment must simultaneously be present. The germ tube of P. macularis {{plays an important}} role in determining the pathogen’s viability, because it can penetrate its host in approximately 15 hours. The germ tube begins branching, leading to as many as three potentially conidia-forming germ tubes. As the pathogen invades host tissue, it establishes a <b>haustorium</b> to facilitate the collection of nutrients from the host cells. Despite this invasion, only certain hosts are susceptible, because there are seven R genes in hop varieties that can be activated in response to infection. Many of them operate by either causing the initial <b>haustorium</b> to lyse, or by preventing the pathogen from spreading. The spread is stopped by a hypersensitive response, which is often associated with the establishment of large callose and lignin deposits surrounding infected cells. Although susceptible plants can increase callose and lignin deposits in response to infection, the hypersensitive response is only found in resistant varieties. Finally, although powdery mildew can grow in a relatively hot and dry environment compared to downy mildew, conidia production peaks at temperatures of approximately 20oC. Conidia can be produced at temperatures above 25oC, but their infectivity is often reduced.|$|E
50|$|Eastern dwarf {{mistletoe}} is a hemiparasitic plant which grows inside the stems {{of a host}} plant. Once a seed lands on a branch it will germinate and grow a <b>haustorium</b> which penetrates past the cambium layer and into the host's xylem and phloem tissues; from those tissues it gathers nutrients needed for its own growth and reproduction. Until the mistletoe grows aerial stems it will be completely reliant on the host for all nutrients and energy; even after it grows aerial stems it will still not produce enough energy to support itself and will still be still reliant on the host.|$|E
50|$|Dendropemon emarginatus is {{commonly}} known as proud tree because it is said to be proud enough as to never touch the ground since it is always growing with support of some other plant.It is a plant parasite and is able to undergo photosynthesis during at least one stage of its life cycle (hemiparasite). It obtains water and required nutrients from its host plant's xylem through a structure called the <b>haustorium,</b> which also provides support by attaching and penetrating the host plant's bark. It is used to prepare tea to treat colds, worms and pain in general.|$|E
50|$|In botany and mycology, a <b>haustorium</b> (plural haustoria) is a {{structure}} that grows into or around another structure to absorb water or nutrients. In botany this may refer to a cotyledon. In mycology {{it refers to the}} appendage or portion of a parasitic fungus (the hyphal tip) or of the root of a parasitic plant (such as the broomrape family or mistletoe) that penetrates the host's tissue and draws nutrients from it. Haustoria penetrate the host plant's cell wall and siphon nutrients from the space between the cell wall and plasma membrane but do not penetrate the plant's cell membrane itself.|$|E
50|$|Below {{the cortex}} layer is a layer called the photobiontic layer or {{symbiont}} layer. The symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments, with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them. The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, {{similar to the}} anatomy of a leaf. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, {{and in some cases}} penetrated by an <b>haustorium.</b> In crustose and foliose lichens, algae in the photobiontic layer are diffuse among the fungal filaments, decreasing in gradation into the layer below. In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below.|$|E
50|$|Dactylanthus taylorii is a round warty tuber-like stem (up to 50 cm wide) or <b>haustorium</b> with no roots, {{which draws}} {{nutrients}} from {{the roots of}} its host. Its leaves do not photosynthesise, and are reduced to floral bracts. Some plants have been aged in excess of 30 years old. Dactylanthus prefers damp but not waterlogged soil, and is often found {{at the head of}} small streams. It parasitises about 30 species of native hardwood trees and shrubs, preferring those growing in secondary forest on the margin of mature podocarp forest. Common hosts include pate or seven-finger (Schefflera digitata), five-finger (Pseudopanax arboreus), lemonwood (Pittosporum eugenioides), and putaputaweta (Carpodetus serratus).|$|E
50|$|Some {{parasitic}} {{plants are}} generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (Cassytha spp., Cuscuta spp.) and red rattle (Odontites vernus) are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few {{or even just}} one species. Beech drops (Epifagus virginiana) is a root holoparasite only on American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Rafflesia is a holoparasite on the vine Tetrastigma. Plants such as Pterospora become parasites of mycorrhizal fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of Tryphysaria experience reduced <b>haustorium</b> development {{in the presence of}} other Tryphysaria. Although, the mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.|$|E
5000|$|They are woody hemi-parasitic shrubs with {{branches}} 10 - 80 cm long, which grow {{on other}} trees. The foliage is dichotomously branching, with opposite pairs of leaves; these are fairly large, 2 - 5 cm long, green and photosynthetic in some species (e.g. P. leucarpum), but minimal in some others (e.g. P. californicum). Although {{they are able}} to photosynthesize the plant relies on its host for some nutrients. The plant draws its mineral and water needs, and some of its energy needs, from the host tree using a <b>haustorium</b> which grows into the stems of the host. The genus name Phoradendron is derived from the Greek for [...] "tree thief".|$|E
50|$|Phoradendron {{species are}} hemiparasites which {{produce their own}} {{chlorophyll}} but rely on the host plant to provide water, minerals, and other nutrients. Birds are the primary means of dispersal of the parasite. Birds consume the drupes of the mistletoe and excrete or regurgitate the seeds onto {{the branches of the}} host plant. Germinating seeds produce a radicle, a holdfast, and eventually the germinated seeds produce haustoria. The <b>haustorium</b> is a root-like structure that penetrates the host plant's bark and cambium, reaching the xylem and phloem where it extracts water and minerals, primarily carbon and nitrogen compounds. The most important birds for effective dispersal include the cedar waxwing, euphonias, silky-flycatchers, bluebirds, and thrushes.|$|E
5000|$|Agelanthus is a genus of Afrotropical {{plants in}} family Loranthaceae. They grow in trees, {{including}} Acacia and Combretum species, as hemiparasitic shrubs of varying sizes. The host plant is penetrated {{by a single}} <b>haustorium,</b> and the stems typically have swollen, flower-producing nodes. The flowers are often closely clustered (fascicled) with the five petals (pentamerous) fused into a tube (gamopetalous). The flower may have a swollen base and the tubes open along unilateral, V-shaped splits. The filaments remain spirally rolled inward when the flowers open, while the styles are inconspicuous, slender filaments that are somewhat thickened in the middle. Berries range from pink to orange and red in colour, and are around 1 cm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|After the {{germination}} of conidia, {{the initial}} {{penetration of the}} host depends on the formation of appressoria near the stomata. This {{is largely due to}} a response of P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina to topographical cues of the host such as stomatal openings. Upon entry of an infection peg through a stomatal opening, hyphae grow and develop between plant cells. When hyphae reach a photosynthetic mesophyll cell a peg penetrates the cell and establishes a <b>haustorium</b> which the fungus uses to absorb the necessary nutrients for its own growth. Through the establishment of haustoria the pathogen develops an intimate relationship with the host. In doing so P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina efficiently redirects the nutrients of the host and delivers effector proteins into the host cytoplasm that suppress the host defense response.|$|E
50|$|Most {{mistletoe}} {{seeds are}} spread by birds that eat the 'seeds' (in actuality drupes). Quite {{a range of}} birds feed on them, of which the mistle thrush is the best-known in Europe, the Phainopepla in southwestern North America, and Dicaeum of Asia and Australia. Depending on the species of mistletoe and the species of bird, the seeds are regurgitated from the crop, excreted in their droppings, or stuck to the bill, from which the bird wipes it onto a suitable branch. The seeds are coated with a sticky material called viscin. Some viscin remains on the seed and when it touches a stem, it sticks tenaciously. The viscin soon hardens and attaches the seed firmly to its future host, where it germinates and its <b>haustorium</b> penetrates the sound bark.|$|E
50|$|Then a peg grows {{into the}} plant's {{mesophyll}} cells. The peg produces specialised hyphal tips, known as haustoria. These {{spread around the}} plant cells without invading the membranes. The plant cell membranes invaginate around the main haustorial body forming a space known as the extra-haustorial matrix. An iron and phosphorus rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes {{in the space between}} the cells for water flow, known as the apoplast, thus preventing the nutrients reaching the plant's cells. The <b>haustorium</b> contains amino acid and hexose sugar transporters and H+-ATPases which are used for active transport of nutrients from the plant nourishing the fungus. It continues growing until spore growth occurs. The process repeats every 10 - 14 days, producing numerous spores, carried by wind to new hosts.|$|E
