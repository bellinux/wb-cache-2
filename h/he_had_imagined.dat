Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author {{was surprised to find}} that the artwork appeared exactly as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone <b>has</b> relaxed or <b>imagined</b> something, or just thinks that <b>he</b> or she <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> something while we know that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not." ...|$|R

500|$|Balzac insisted to Gozlan that by {{searching through}} the streets of Paris, they would find a name {{suitable}} for a character <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> a political genius thwarted by the mediocrity of the time. They finally came upon a tailor's sign that enraptured Balzac, bearing the name Z. Marcas. He believed that the name suggested [...] ("some mysterious fatality"), and chose it for his story's protagonist. He wrote the 30-page story soon afterwards.|$|E

In columns written in the final years before his 2009 death, Safire commented that the sign was [...] "almost {{too good to be}} true", and said of Moore, [...] "e may have made that up".|$|E
500|$|George Harrison's song [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] {{dates back}} to the {{recording}} sessions for his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, and was {{one of a number of}} tracks left over from that project. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980), Harrison recalls writing the tune on an organ and, not being an accomplished keyboard player, having difficulties doing the correct fingering in both hands. It was only when his friend Klaus Voormann took over the left-hand part, to play the bass line, that he was able to hear the piece as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it.|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{announced}} the novel on October 6, 2006 on his blog, where {{fragments of the}} work were posted non-sequentially for some time, leading to much reader speculation on the content and plot of the novel. The following day, the blog featured {{an exploration of the}} mooted title by close friend and collaborator Jack Womack. In August 2007, Gibson made an appearance in the virtual world Second Life to give a reading of the novel; later reflecting on the experience, he remarked that the Second Life construct was [...] "a lot more corporate" [...] than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> A report in The Times described the event as [...] "heavily freighted with meaning" [...] in light of Gibson's role in shaping conceptions of cyberspace and virtual worlds.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{arrived in}} New York on 15 October 1936, with Kertész intent on finding fame in America. They {{lived at the}} Beaux Arts Hotel in Greenwich Village. Kertész found life in America more {{difficult}} than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> beginning a period which he later {{referred to as the}} [...] "absolute tragedy". Deprived of his artist friends, he also found that Americans rejected having their photos taken on the street. Soon after his arrival, Kertész approached Beaumont Newhall, director of the photographic department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), who was preparing a show entitled Photography 1839–1937. Offering Newhall some of his Distortions photographs, Kertész bristled at his criticism, but Newhall did exhibit the photographs. In December 1937 Kertész had his first solo show in New York at the PM Gallery.|$|E
500|$|His {{work now}} {{reflected}} {{his belief that}} any good artist must be [...] "more than {{a bit of a}} reporting journalist". In 1936, Auden spent three months in Iceland where he gathered material for a travel book Letters from Iceland (1937), written in collaboration with Louis MacNeice. In 1937 he went to Spain intending to drive an ambulance for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War, but was put to work broadcasting propaganda, a job he left to visit the front. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply, and his social views grew more complex as he found political realities to be more ambiguous and troubling than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Again attempting to combine reportage and art, he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting China amid the Sino-Japanese War, working on their book Journey to a War (1939). On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent late 1938 partly in England, partly in Brussels.|$|E

500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ RedTop as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it, [...] "two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other". Hence he wanted the verse to represent {{the reality of the}} situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.|$|E
500|$|Dick became {{concerned}} {{that no one}} had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it. He said, [...] "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." [...] He also approved of the film's script, saying, [...] "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." [...] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.|$|E

Their party found that travel down the Fraser was relatively easy until it forked with the Thompson River, after which the powerful rapids and sheer cliffs convinced Simpson the passage would be [...] "certain Death, in nine attempts out of Ten." [...] At least some part of the journey from the north would have to be made overland to bypass the Fraser Canyon and Hell's Gate.|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{joined the}} cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) during its 1985–86 season {{at the age of}} 17. He was, and remains, the {{youngest}} cast member in the show's history. His recurring characters on the show were Craig Sundberg, Idiot Savant, an intelligent, talented teenager with a vacant expression and stilted speech, and Fed Jones, half of the habitually high, hustling pitchmen known as The Jones Brothers. (The other Jones Brother was played by short-lived featured player Damon Wayans). Art Garfunkel, Edd Byrnes, Robert F. Kennedy, and Daryl Hall were among Hall's celebrity impersonations. Hall had admired the show and its stars as a child, but he found the SNL environment to be far more competitive than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> [...] "My year there, I didn't have any breakout characters and I didn't really do the things I dreamed I would do," [...] he said, [...] "but I still learned a lot, and I value that.

2500|$|Living off his {{inheritance}} {{and modest}} work income, Remington {{refused to go}} back to art school and instead spent time camping and enjoying himself. At nineteen, he made his first trip west, going to Montana, at first to buy a cattle operation then a mining interest but realized he did not have sufficient capital for either. In the American West of 1881, he saw the vast prairies, the quickly shrinking buffalo herds, the still unfenced cattle, and the last major confrontations of U.S. Cavalry and Native American tribes, scenes <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> since his childhood. He also hunted grizzly bears with Montague Stevens in New Mexico in 1895. Though the trip was undertaken as a lark, it gave Remington a more authentic view of the West than some of the later artists and writers who followed in his footsteps, such as N. C. Wyeth and Zane Grey, who arrived twenty-five years later when much of the mythic West had already slipped into history. From that first trip, Harper's Weekly printed Remington's first published commercial effort, a re-drawing of a quick sketch on wrapping paper that he had mailed back East. In 1883, Remington went to rural Peabody, Kansas, to try his hand at the booming sheep ranching and wool trade, as one of the [...] "holiday stockmen", rich young Easterners out to make a quick killing as ranch owners. He invested his entire inheritance but found ranching to be a rough, boring, isolated occupation which deprived him of the finer things of Eastern life, and the real ranchers thought of him as lazy.|$|E
