5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having left}} TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only {{wrestled}} in four matches during {{the remainder of}} the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at WWC Euphoria Tour 2008 on January 6, 2008, with Ron Killings of the 3LiveKru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that while the company said that they would help pay for his <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner's operation, but did not pay for Ron Killings's surgery from around the same time.|$|E

5|$|She is a {{supporter}} of the United States Democratic Party and the British Labour Party. Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987 she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age, but has stated that she has not had surgery to make her face look younger. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.|$|E

On February 2, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles that included an invitation to spring training. He suffered an injury and {{did not make the}} cut, and was sent to the minor leagues. He made one appearance for the Class-AA Bowie Baysox, and then joined the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Class-AAA affiliate.

5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial <b>hip</b> <b>replacement.</b> About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} {{approach}} {{as an alternative}} to <b>hip</b> <b>replacement</b> is conservative management which involves a multimodal approach of medication, activity modification and physical therapy.

40|$|The {{investigation}} into modes of failure of total <b>hip</b> <b>replacements</b> was {{the purpose of}} this project. This involved the development of a finite element model of a simplified uncemented, simplified cemented and a geometrically real hip in order to study the behaviour of loosening of the prosthesis. Loosening of the femoral and acetabular components in total <b>hip</b> <b>replacements</b> are major long-term complications of <b>hip</b> <b>replacements.</b> Such loosening usually produces substantial loss of supporting bone making revision much more difficult and less successful than primary surgery. Implant loosening can be caused from resorption of the bone around the prosthesis from wear debris, insufficient osseointegration of the bone into the prosthesis and brittle failure of the bone cement...|$|R

40|$|The metal-on-metal articulations {{in total}} hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) were widely used between 1960 and 1975. The McKee-Farrar and other first-generation prostheses failed at a high rate because impingement caused early component loosening. The problem of early component loosening was corrected by improved component design and better manufacturing quality. Second-generation metal-on-metal total <b>hip</b> <b>replacements</b> have experienced short and medium-term success as assessed by Harris Hip Scores and patient selfassessment. The combined annual linear wear of the metal-on-metal femoral head and acetabular insert is less than 10 mm and osteolysis has only rarely been observed in association with well-fixed metal-on-metal total <b>hip</b> <b>replacements.</b> Hypersensitivity is not a common cause of loosening with second-generation <b>hip</b> <b>replacements</b> and remains to be proven as a definitive diagnosis in unusual cases of unexplained pain. More than 40 years of use has demonstrated no increase {{in the incidence of}} renal failure or cancer in patients with metal-on-metal total <b>hip</b> <b>replacements.</b> The scientific evidence of the results using the metal-on-metal articulations would recommend its continued use in any patient who does not have compromised renal function...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Total <b>hip</b> {{and knee}} <b>replacements</b> are {{surgical}} procedures {{commonly used in}} cases of degenerative articular problems, intrarticular fractures and less common in tumor conditions. Despite its great success complications can arise. Objective: Describe complications in total knee and <b>hip</b> <b>replacements.</b> Methods: A descriptive study, cases serie was done in Hospital Universitario San José in Popayán Colombia, analyzing the period between January 2004 and January 2009, Seventy six patients were included: 53 total <b>hips</b> <b>replacements,</b> 12 cases of partial <b>hip</b> <b>replacements</b> and 11 total knee replacements. Patient's age was in the range between 27 and 97. Results: The main complications founded were: respiratory insufficiency, inability to place the prosthesis, prosthesis dislocation, anemic syndrome, acetabular protrusion, infection, iatrogenic Gushing's syndrome, discrepancy of length limb, residual pain, inability to walk, nosocomial pneumonia, renal failure and periprosthetic fracture. An average of 4, 6 % mortality index, 10, 8 % hip prosthesis dislocation, 9, 2 % infections, all these indices over the different literature reports...|$|R
