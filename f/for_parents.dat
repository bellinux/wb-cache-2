Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Background Raising {{children}} with borderline to mild intellectual disability (BMID) and psychosocial problems may yield a strong need <b>for</b> support among <b>parents,</b> but evidence <b>for</b> this is lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the prevalence of need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support in this population, and the child and parent characteristics that influence this need. Method We obtained data from parents of 944 children aged 5 - 12 years with BMID (IQ 50 - 85) in the Netherlands: 134 (14. 2 %) of these parents had a need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support. Results The results of multiple regression analyses revealed that parenting stress and child psychosocial problems, adjusted for age and gender of the child, were associated with a need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support. Conclusions One in seven parents with a child with BMID has a need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support. Determinants associated with a need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support are parenting stress and child psychosocial problems...|$|R

5|$|Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids is a non-fiction book by Maia Szalavitz {{analyzing}} {{the controversy surrounding}} the tough love behavior modification industry. The book was published February 16, 2006, by Riverhead Books. Szalavitz focuses on four programs: Straight, Incorporated, {{a copy of the}} Straight Inc. program called KIDS, North Star wilderness boot camp, and the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. She discusses the background, history and methodology of the troubled-teen industry, including techniques drawn from attack therapy and Synanon. She uses first-person accounts and court testimony in her research, and states that no evidence exists proving that these programs are effective. The book also includes advice <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> and an appendix with additional resources on how to get responsible help for teenagers.|$|E

It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003.

Competence conditions, determining favourable educational environment <b>for</b> <b>parent</b> education in pre-school education establishments, which are formed of pedagogues and parents’ collaboration and parents’ communication between themselves, have been examined in the research.

A substantial number of mothers in a community sample reported need <b>for</b> <b>parenting</b> support. This need for support was related with behavior problems {{of the child and}} with negative parenting behaviors.

5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> {{to select}} a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. <b>For</b> <b>parents</b> unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E

Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory <b>for</b> <b>parents.</b> Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
