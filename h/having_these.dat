5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category <b>having</b> <b>these</b> branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category <b>having</b> <b>these</b> branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about <b>having</b> <b>these</b> abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E

Ultimately, Martí refused to cooperate with Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years' War, when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Martí {{knew that it was}} too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.|$|E

25|$|Icon {{player was}} a status given to five {{players of the}} Indian Premier League. They were {{not a part of}} the first IPL players auction, which was held in 2008.

25|$|The actual {{pricing and}} rate {{analysis}} of adjustable rate mortgage in the finance industry is done through various computer simulation methodologies like Monte Carlo method or Sobol sequences. In these techniques, {{by using an}} assumed probability distribution of future interest rates, numerous (10,000–100,000 or even 1,000,000) possible interest rate scenarios are explored, mortgage cash flows calculated under each, and aggregate parameters like fair value and effective interest rate {{over the life of}} the mortgage are estimated. <b>Having</b> <b>these</b> at hand, lending analysts determine whether offering a particular mortgage would be profitable, and if it would represent tolerable risk to the bank.|$|E
25|$|Expanding {{intermittent}} electrical {{sources such}} as wind power, creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental super grids costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, {{there are a variety}} of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. <b>Having</b> <b>these</b> abilities is one of the chief aims of a smart grid.|$|E

25|$|In one direction, {{suppose a}} path {{decomposition}} of G is given. Then one {{may represent the}} nodes of the decomposition as points on a line (in path order) and represent each vertex v as a closed interval <b>having</b> <b>these</b> points as endpoints. In this way, the path decomposition nodes containing v correspond to the representative points in the interval for v. The intersection graph of the intervals formed from the vertices of G is an interval graph that contains G as a subgraph. Its maximal cliques are given by the sets of intervals containing the representative points, and its maximum clique size is one plus the pathwidth of G.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Young–Fibonacci graph and Young–Fibonacci lattice, {{named after}} Alfred Young and Leonardo Fibonacci, are two closely related {{structures}} involving sequences of the digits 1 and 2. Any digit sequence {{of this type}} can be assigned a rank, {{the sum of its}} digits: for instance, the rank of 11212 is 1+1+2+1+2=7. As was already known in ancient India, the number of sequences with a given rank is a Fibonacci number. The Young–Fibonacci lattice is an infinite modular lattice <b>having</b> <b>these</b> digit sequences as its elements, compatible with this rank structure. The Young–Fibonacci graph is the graph of this lattice, and has a vertex for each digit sequence. As the graph of a modular lattice, it is a modular graph.|$|E
25|$|Spawning occurs year round, but {{a peak of}} {{spawning}} activity occurs {{once during}} the year at variable times over the species range. Peak of spawning in Thailand is August and November, November to April in the Philippines, November to March in India, and between July and February with a peak in November in Sri Lanka. The egg is spherical, colourless and buoyant, 0.5 to 0.6mm in diameter, and without a large oil globule. Fecundity varied between 16 682 and 166 130. The eggs and larval development of S. sihama has been extensively described separately by Bensam and Kato et al., with the distinguishing feature of the larvae being the pattern of melanophores distributed on the caudal fin base, <b>having</b> <b>these</b> in a vertical line.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the member}} congregations of the UUA are in the United States and Canada, but the UUA has also {{admitted}} congregations from Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Pakistan (although UUA policy appears at present to be against admitting any new congregations from outside North America, rather having them form their own national bodies and <b>having</b> <b>these</b> bodies join the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists). Until 2002, almost all member congregations of the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) were also members of the UUA and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, after an agreement between the UUA and the CUC, since 2002 most services have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations, with the UUA continuing to provide ministerial settlement services. Since 2002, some Canadian congregations have continued {{to be members of}} both the UUA and CUC while others are members of only the CUC.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the sampling process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images <b>having</b> <b>these</b> problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E

25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of <b>having</b> <b>these</b> two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
