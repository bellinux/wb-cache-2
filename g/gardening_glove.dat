5000|$|In 2011, the Maricopa County, Arizona Sherriff's Office began {{investigating}} {{a string of}} robberies, dating to at least 1993, of high-end homes {{in the vicinity of}} Paradise Valley, Arizona. Investigators noted that the assailant (or assailants) wore fabric/cloth <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> with rubber grips that had left unique prints on many surfaces in the burglarized locations. Upon arresting a 58-year-old suspect near a home that was under surveillance by the sheriff's office, authorities found amongst burglary tools in his possession, <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> that matched the unique prints found at the burglarized locations.|$|R

60|$|The real {{achievement}} of the earlier part of David Copperfield lies in a certain impression of the little Copperfield living in a land of giants. It is at once Gargantuan in its fancy and grossly vivid in its facts; like Gulliver {{in the land of}} Brobdingnag when he describes mountainous hands and faces filling the sky, bristles as big as hedges, or moles as big as molehills. To him parents and guardians are not Olympians (as in Mr. Kenneth Grahame's clever book), mysterious and dignified, dwelling upon a cloudy hill. Rather they are all the more visible for being large. They come all the closer because they are colossal. Their queer features and weaknesses stand out large in a sort of gigantic domesticity, like the hairs and freckles of a Brobdingnagian. We feel the sombre Murdstone coming upon the house like a tall storm striding through the sky. We watch every pucker of Peggotty's peasant face in its moods of flinty prejudice or whimsical hesitation. We look up and feel that Aunt Betsey in her <b>garden</b> <b>gloves</b> was really terrible--especially her <b>garden</b> <b>gloves.</b> But one cannot avoid the impression that as the boy grows larger these figures grow smaller, and are not perhaps so completely satisfactory.|$|R

50|$|During {{his years}} at Concordia, Marxhausen gained repute {{as a unique}} and inspiring educator. He {{constantly}} encouraged his students to see the beauty in everyday life. In a fundamental art class, he took his students outside in the winter, asking them to sculpt with snow. He took students to the local dump for a Thanksgiving Day service, highlighting the vast sea of material goods for which to give thanks. Much of his own art consisted of found objects - <b>garden</b> <b>gloves,</b> dryer lint, tire rubber, marbles, and other scraps he picked up around his home.|$|R
6000|$|Silence ensued, {{during which}} Agatha, furtively scrutinizing the tenant of the chalet, {{noticed that his}} face and neck were cleaner and less sunburnt {{than those of the}} {{ordinary}} toilers of Lyvern. His hands were hidden by large <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> stained with coal dust. Lyvern laborers, as a rule, had little objection to soil their hands; they never wore gloves. Still, she thought, there was no reason why an eccentric workman, insufferably talkative, and capable of an allusion to the pen of the poet, should not indulge himself with cheap gloves.

60|$|I {{had been}} discomposed enough before; but I {{was so much}} the more discomposed by this {{unexpected}} behaviour, that I was {{on the point of}} slinking off, to think how I had best proceed, when there {{came out of the house}} a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap, and a pair of <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> on her hands, wearing a gardening pocket like a toll-man's apron, and carrying a great knife. I knew her immediately to be Miss Betsey, for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery.|$|R

The hachimaki is a {{trademark}} of Makoto's design, added in 3rd Strike by the development team to demonstrate her speed and trajectory. They used its fluttering as she charged up her Hayate technique as an example. Because {{there was nothing in}} the Street Fighter IV engine that allowed them to do that, they had to create this mechanic especially for her. Before the release of 3rd Strike, rumors were circulating among players that Makoto was Ryu's younger sister, due to her similar wardrobe. Makoto's alternate costume in Super Street Fighter IV was the hardest to create out of all the characters' costumes. Her alternate costume consists of a sun hat, denim overalls, and <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R

My aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated, and this done, she found great joy {{in the garden and}} became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer, leaving her Mind, indeed, to damp evenings and the winter months. When I think of her at Beckenham, I always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected, with her arms in huge gauntleted <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves,</b> a trowel {{in one hand and a}} small but no doubt hardy and promising annual, limp and very young-looking and sheepish, in the other.|$|R

60|$|On the {{following}} day, about {{five in the}} afternoon, he rode through the iron gates, which he with difficulty caused to be opened for him, and asked for Mrs. Bolton. When he had been here before, the winter had commenced, and everything around had been dull and ugly; {{but now it was}} July, and the patch before the house was bright with flowers. The roses were in full bloom, and every morsel of available soil was bedded out with geraniums. As he stood holding his horse by the rein while he rang the bell, a side-door leading through the high brick wall from the garden, which stretched away behind the house, was suddenly opened, and a lady came through with a garden hat on, and <b>garden</b> <b>gloves,</b> and a basket full of rose leaves in her hand. It was the lady of whom he had never ceased to think from the day on which he had been allowed just to touch her fingers, now five years ago.|$|R

60|$|The sun was {{now at the}} meridian. On a {{slope to}} Gertrude's right hand, Sallust's House, with its cinnamon-colored walls and yellow frieze, gave a foreign air to the {{otherwise}} very English landscape. She passed by without remembering who lived there. Further down, on some waste land separated from the road by a dry ditch and a low mud wall, a cluster of hemlocks, nearly six feet high, poisoned the air with their odor. She crossed the ditch, took a pair of <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> from her plaited straw hand-basket, and busied herself with the hemlock leaves, pulling the tender ones, separating them from the stalk, and filling the basket with the web. She forgot Max until an impression of dead silence, as if the earth had stopped, caused her to look round in vague dread. Trefusis, with his hand abandoned to the dog, who was trying {{how much of it}} he could cram into his mouth, was standing within a few yards of her, watching her intently. Gertrude turned pale, and came out hastily from among the bushes. Then she had a strange sensation as if something had happened high above her head. There was a threatening growl, a commanding exclamation, and an unaccountable pause, at the expiration of which she found herself supine on the sward, with her parasol between her eyes and the sun. A sudden scoop of Max's wet warm tongue in her right ear startled her into activity. She sat up, and saw Trefusis on his knees at her side holding the parasol with an unconcerned expression, whilst Max was snuffing at her in restless anxiety opposite.|$|R

In the earlier two books, Rules of Prey & Shadow Prey his standard sidearm is the P7, but in Eyes of Prey he later adopts a [...]45 Smith & Wesson of unstated model; he retains the P7 as a [...] "dress gun" [...] for off duty carry. In Silent Prey, he uses the Colt Gold Cup as his sidearm while in New York. As of Certain Prey onwards his usual sidearm is a customized [...]45 Colt Gold Cup, carried with the chamber empty; something that gives him problems when his left arm is in a cast. In Invisible Prey, he has a cache containing: two [...] "cold" [...] pistols with magazines, a homemade silencer that fits none of his guns (he kept meaning to throw it away, but never did), an old-fashioned lead-and-leather sap, a hydraulic door-spreader that he'd picked up from a burglary site, $5,000 in $20 bills in a paper bank envelope, a pill bottle of amphetamines, a box of surgical gloves and a battery-powered lock rake. In Buried Prey the cache contains at least the rake along with a ring of [...] "bump" [...] keys, a small crowbar, a pair of white cotton <b>garden</b> <b>gloves</b> and a LED headlamp. By Storm Prey he has acquired, and uses, a detachable magazine Beretta shotgun of unstated model, probably an M3P. In Stolen Prey Lucas uses a 9mm Beretta 92F as his main sidearm, presumably {{because he had a}} cast on his left arm and it would present an issue if he needed to insert a shell into the chamber of his customized [...]45 Colt Gold Cup. He switches back to his customized [...]45 Colt Gold Cup in the next book, Silken Prey.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Infection with Toxoplasma gondii {{is common}} and usually asymptomatic, {{although}} it can have catastrophic consequences in a pregnant woman if passed to her developing fetus. Counseling of pregnant women about risk factor reduction may {{reduce the risk of}} congenital toxoplasmosis. This study was undertaken to assess and compare the knowledge of obstetricians and internists or family practitioners regarding well-established risk factors for toxoplasmosis infection. METHODS: The study surveyed 102 obstetricians, internists and family practitioners to assess their knowledge of risk factors for toxoplasmosis infection as well as their practices for primary prevention counseling of pregnant women. Responses were analyzed for differences. RESULTS: Obstetricians were more likely than internists or family practitioners to provide appropriate counseling on reducing the two most common risk factors for toxoplasmosis infection (undercooked meat consumption and <b>gardening</b> without <b>gloves).</b> However, over one quarter of all participants inappropriately advised pregnant women to avoid all cat contact. Obstetricians, internists and family practitioners were all likely to fail to identify undercooked meat consumption as the primary risk factor for toxoplasmosis transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetricians appear to provide more appropriate counseling for primary prevention of toxoplasmosis than internists and family practitioners, but both groups of physicians inappropriately advised avoidance of all cat contact. Education of obstetricians, internists and family practitioners on risk factors for toxoplasmosis transmission is needed and may lower the rate of congenital toxoplasmosis as well as decrease the frequency of cat abandonment during pregnancy...|$|R
6000|$|The {{seemingly}} quaint {{custom of}} comparing Dickens and Thackeray existed {{in their own}} time, {{and no one will}} dismiss it with entire disdain who remembers that the Victorian tradition was domestic and genuine, even when it was hoodwinked and unworldly. There must have been some reason for making this imaginary duel between two quite separate and quite amiable acquaintances. And there is, after all, some reason for it. It is not, as was once cheaply said, that Thackeray went in for truth, and Dickens for mere caricature. There is a huge accumulation of truth, down to the smallest detail, in Dickens: he seems sometimes a mere mountain of facts. Thackeray, in comparison, often seems quite careless and elusive; almost as if he did not quite know where all his characters were. There is a truth behind the popular distinction; but it lies much deeper. Perhaps the best way of stating it is this: that Dickens used reality, while aiming at an effect of romance; while Thackeray used the loose language and ordinary approaches of romance, while aiming at an effect of reality. It was the special and splendid business of Dickens to introduce us to people who would have been quite incredible if he had not told us so much truth about them. It was the special and not less splendid task of Thackeray to introduce us to people whom we knew already. Paradoxically, but very practically, it followed that his introductions were the longer of the two. When we hear of Aunt Betsy Trotwood, we vividly envisage everything about her, from her <b>gardening</b> <b>gloves</b> to her seaside residence, from her hard, handsome face to her tame lunatic laughing at the bedroom window. It is all so minutely true that she must be true also. We only feel inclined to walk round the English coast until we find that particular garden and that particular aunt. But when we turn from the aunt of Copperfield to the uncle of Pendennis, we are more likely to run round the coast trying to find a watering-place where he isn't than one where he is. The moment one sees Major Pendennis, one sees a hundred Major Pendennises. It {{is not a matter of}} mere realism. Miss Trotwood's bonnet and gardening tools and cupboard full of old-fashioned bottles are quite as true in the materialistic way as the Major's cuffs and corner table and toast and newspaper. Both writers are realistic: but Dickens writes realism in order to make the incredible credible. Thackeray writes it in order to make us recognise an old friend. Whether we shall be pleased to meet the old friend is quite another matter: I think we should be better pleased to meet Miss Trotwood, and find, as David Copperfield did, a new friend, a new world. But we recognise Major Pendennis even when we avoid him. Henceforth Thackeray can count on our seeing him from his wig to his well-blacked boots whenever he chooses to say [...] "Major Pendennis paid a call." [...] Dickens, on the other hand, had to keep up an incessant excitement about his characters; and no man on earth but he could have kept it up.|$|R

He puts them down in his garden.Kath Green leaves her two-year-old daughter Amanda playing with her dolls in her conservatory to buy the little girl an ice cream. In her mother's absence, Amanda finds a slime trail, puts her hand in it and licks it off. Later that night, Kath rushes into Amanda's bedroom to find her convulsing on the bed. In a wild frenzy, Amanda bites her Mum's neck who then falls downstairs bleeding to death. Ray Green returns home from work to find both his wife and daughter dead.Brady goes to see if the poison has done its job, but although some of the pellets have gone, the slugs are still there.Computer firm rep David Watson and his wife Maureen sit down to Sunday lunch. David eats half a slug which was hidden in some lettuce. He goes to bed that night with a terrible stomach ache and awakes with a very bad headache.At a business lunch that day in the City Hotel, David Watson tries to secure a new contract with Edward Canning and Kenneth Riggs. David is overcome by a terrible headache until finally blood gushes from one of his nostrils and a long white worm slithers out of it. David falls onto a table dying as another slug bursts out of one of his eyes. A waiter from the restaurant calls the local Health Inspector.Brady investigates the sickening scene and finds the worms lying dead next to Watson's body. He takes them to the museum for Foley to look at. Foley tells Brady that he has been reading up on the slugs and after dissecting and doing tests, he says that they are a hybrid of the ordinary garden variety. The white worms are [...] "schistosomes", a parasite found in the blood stream of slugs. If ingested by humans they cause the often fatal disease Schistomiasis. Foley tells Brady that he will start work on making a poison.Clive Talbot, 18, and Donna Moss, 17, are having sex in Donna's parents' bedroom while they are out. Slugs make their way through the garden, into the drain, up the drain pipe, along the guttering, down onto a window sill and drop onto the floor of the bedroom. Donna is killed first as the slugs crawl inside her. Clive, also being eaten alive jumps from the bedroom window straight onto a cold frame below and is killed by a shard of glass.Brady returns home and tells Kim about the days events at the City Hotel.

Dr. Warwick at his surgery to see if he has had any unusual cases. The doctor tells him he has had nine complaints so far of nausea, headaches, sensitivity to light, diarrhoea, fever and vomiting. Brady explains that he thinks the water is contaminated, and Warwick says that there is a species of snail that spreads a disease called Bilharzia, but that disease is confined to Africa and Asia. Brady goes to see Merton's Water Board Inspector Frank Phillips and explains to him what has happened, asking him to turn the water supply off. Phillips laughs and refuses. Brady spots an article in a local newspaper saying that police are baffled about three mysterious deaths. He returns to his office to find that Foley has left a message with Julie.Brady goes to see Foley at the museum. He has developed a liquid that kills slugs on contact. However, it explodes when it touches moisture so they talk to Don Palmer about how to get it into the sewer system. The plan is for Brady and Palmer to go down into the sewer by Ron Bell's house and act as bait, luring the slugs into a central chamber, while Foley waits above ground and releases the poison.Brady and Palmer climb into Ron Bell's house through a broken window and go down into the cellar where they find hundreds of slugs on the floor. They empty a can of petrol into the cellar, ignite it then leave the house. Equipped with overalls, masks, oxygen tanks and two-way radios, Brady and Palmer and go down into the sewer via a manhole cover outside the house.Brady and Palmer test their radios, then begin searching the central chambers of the sewers for the slugs' nest. Foley follows them in above his car. They find the slugs, but become trapped when they cannot remove a grille from a chamber. Brady eventually removes the grille but Palmer is eaten by the slugs in the meantime. Foley drives to the manhole cover where Brady can escape but the cover is jammed shut. Using a rope tied to his car he manages to remove the manhole cover, just before Brady's oxygen supply runs out. Both men tip the 5 gallon drum of poison down into the sewer which sets off a chain reaction sweeping through the entire Merton sewer system.Farmer George Thomas from Merton, drives to London's Covent Garden to deliver some vegetables to a buyer.
