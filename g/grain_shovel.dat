25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Kilmaurs Mill was a carved stone showing a {{millstone}} drive spider or rind (often used on Miller's tombstones {{as a symbol}} of the milling trade) on which the upper grindstone rested, a ring of rope, a bill for dressing millstones, and a <b>grain</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The city {{colors of}} Bad Waldsee {{are black and}} silver (sometimes shown in white). The fish {{to the left of}} the arms stands for the fishing from the city's lakes. The star over the arms symbolizes the city's devotion to the Virgin Mary, who is venerated at the {{mountain}} chapel [...] "Our Dear Lady of the Mountain." [...] An oar, sometimes interpreted as a <b>grain</b> <b>shovel,</b> on the right of the crest highlights the fishing and/or farming in the area. The seal itself comes from the first possessor of the city, the Lords of Waldsee.|$|E
50|$|Every barony had a thirled mill {{held by the}} laird {{which his}} tenant farmers had to use, and the nearby Kilmaurs Mill on the Carmel Water dated back to at least the early 17th century as shown by old maps of the area. A mill {{on the site of}} old Kilmaurs Mill may {{therefore}} have been the one directly associated with the laird at the Place. An unusual feature of this old mill was a carved stone showing a millstone drive spider or rind (often used on Miller's tombstones {{as a symbol of the}} milling trade) on which the upper grindstone rested, a ring of rope, a bill for dressing millstones, and a <b>grain</b> <b>shovel.</b> This stone still survives at the site of the old mill, built into a wall.|$|E

60|$|Blackened {{men with}} {{smoldering}} clothes were, however, ready, and they fought each incipient blaze with soaked <b>grain</b> bags, and <b>shovels,</b> {{some of them}} also, careless of blistered arms, with their own wet jackets. As fast as each fire was trampled out another sprang into life, but the parent blaze that fed them sank and died, and at last there was a hoarse cheer. They had won, and the fire they had beaten passed on divided across the prairie, leaving the homestead unscathed between.|$|R
50|$|Rescues of an {{entrapped}} victim usually entail building makeshift {{retaining walls}} in the grain around them with plywood, sheet metal, tarpaulins, snow fences or any other similar material available. Once that has been done, {{the next step is}} creating the equivalent of a cofferdam within the grain from which grain can then be removed by hand, <b>shovel,</b> <b>grain</b> vacuum or other extraction equipment. While some of these techniques have been used to retrieve engulfed victims or their bodies as well, in those cases it is also common to attempt to cut a hole {{in the side of the}} storage facility; this requires consulting an engineer to make sure it can be done without compromising the facility's structural integrity. There is also the possibility of a dust explosion, although none are known to have occurred yet during a rescue attempt.|$|R
