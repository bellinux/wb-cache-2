40|$|This paper {{presents}} my {{reflections on}} becoming a researcher and explores {{the usefulness of}} writing throughout the research process. Publishing is a key performance indicator in academia, and writing is an essential skill needed to get work published. However, writing in research is more than using this skill to gain publications and disseminate findings, writing about research offers opportunities to ensure methodological congruence and professional growth. I explore how reflective writing throughout my PhD process in Australia strengthened my reflections {{about the impact of}} my own assumptions and ideas in the research process. Moreover, a cyclic process of data analysis and dissemination of the findings via conference and peer-reviewed publications contributed to engagement with the data, the formulation of ideas and the exploration of new data with a fresh mind and curiosity. I propose that writing throughout the research process assisted me in staying within my methodological framework, <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the participants and a wider audience, helped me consider voice in research, enabled an early submission of the PhD and facilitated my growth as a novice researcher...|$|E

Where the memory of Giuliana had failed to move me to aught but penance and increasing rigours, the foul fiend sought to <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a seeming purity to my ultimate destruction. Thus had Anthony, the Egyptian monk, been tempted; and under one guise or another it was ever the same Circean lure.|$|R

My lightest word can make or mar a new production. If I say a piece is bad, it dies. It may not die instantly.

6000|$|... 3. I {{forgot to}} tell you that {{yesterday}} morning I was at Mr. Harley's levee: he swore I came in spite, to see him among a parcel of fools. My business was to desire I might let the Duke of Ormond know how the affair stood of the First-Fruits. He promised to let him know it, and <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to dine <b>with</b> him to-day. Every Saturday, Lord Keeper, Secretary St. John, and I dine with him, and sometimes Lord Rivers; and they let in none else. Patrick brought me some letters into the Park; among which one was from Walls; and t'other, yes, faith, t'other was from our little MD, N.11. I read the rest in the Park, and MD's in a chair as I went from St. James's to Mr. Harley; and glad enough I was, faith, to read it, and see all right. Oh, but I won't answer it these three or four days at least, or may be sooner. An't I silly? faith, your letters would make a dog silly, if I had a dog to be silly, but it must be a little dog.--I stayed with Mr. Harley till past nine, where we had much discourse together after the rest were gone; and I gave him very truly my opinion where he desired it. He complained he was not very well, and has <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to dine <b>with</b> him again on Monday. So I came home afoot, like a fine gentleman, to tell you all this.|$|R

You see, unfortunately, I look my age. With most men {{it would have made}} a difference. You have no idea how good he is. He assured <b>me</b> he had <b>engaged</b> himself to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> his eyes open, {{and that there was no}} need to dwell upon {{unpleasant}} topics. It is so wonderful to me that he should care for me--he who could have half the women in London at his feet." ...|$|R

Miss Ashe is almost quite well, and I see the Bishop, but shall not yet go to his house. I dined again with Lord Treasurer; but the Parliament being prorogued, I must keep what I have till next week: for I believe he will not see it till just the evening before the session. He has <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to dine <b>with</b> him again to-morrow, though I did all I could to put it off; but I don't care to disoblige him. Nite dee sollahs 'tis late. Nite MD.|$|R

Again at {{the lobby}} (like a lobcock)(8) of the House of Commons, about your Irish yarn, and again put off till Friday; and I and Patrick {{went into the}} City by water, where I dined, and then I went to the auction of Charles Barnard's books; but the good ones were so monstrous dear, I could not reach them, so I laid out one pound seven shillings but very indifferently, and came away, and will go there no more. Henley would fain <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> to go <b>with</b> Steele and Rowe, etc., to an {{invitation}} at Sir William Read's.(9) Surely you have heard of him. He has been a mountebank, and is the Queen's oculist; he makes admirable punch, and treats you in gold vessels. But I am engaged, and will not go, neither indeed am I fond of the jaunt. So good-night, and go sleep.|$|R
60|$|At breakfast {{the next}} morning the son of the house, an <b>engaging</b> lad, {{presented}} <b>me</b> <b>with</b> an unexpected dish, three fossil starfish on a platter. They were found, he said, in numbers, {{on the sides of the}} hill hard by; a fact which would go to prove that this part of Japan has been making in later geologic time. Indeed, I take it the better part of Etchiu has thus been cast up by the sea, and now lies between its semicircle of peaks and its crescent of beach, like a young moon in the western sky, a new bay of ricefield in the old bay's arms. We had come by way of its ocean terminator along its fringe of sand; we were now to cross its face.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} before your time (said the Oldest Member) {{that the events}} which I am about to relate took place. I had just come down from Cambridge, and was feeling {{particularly}} pleased with myself because I had secured the job of private and confidential secretary to Vincent Jopp, then {{a man in the}} early thirties, busy in laying the foundations of his present remarkable fortune. He <b>engaged</b> <b>me,</b> and took <b>me</b> <b>with</b> him to Chicago.|$|R

The Secretary and I and Bathurst are to dine with him on Sunday next. The Duke is not in much hopes, but has been very busy in endeavouring to bring over some lords against next Wednesday. The Duchess caught me as I was going out; she is sadly in fear about things, and blames me for not mending them by my credit with Lord Treasurer; and I blame her. She met me in the street at noon, and <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to dine <b>with</b> her, which I did; and we talked an hour after dinner in her closet. If we miscarry on Wednesday, I believe it will be by some strange sort of neglect. They talk of making eight new lords by calling up some peers' eldest sons; but they delay strangely. I saw Judge Coote(16) to-day at the Duke of Ormond's: he desires to come and see me, to justify his principles.|$|R

Had he seen <b>me</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> their two throats, he would have been at mine like a fierce dog, or any other savage and faithful brute. I had no difficulty in dissembling my longing for the vulgar, stupid, and hopeless argument of fight. I remarked that I really did not want a servant. I couldn't think of depriving them of their man's services; but they would not hear me. They had made up their minds.|$|R
60|$|Another was {{a skilled}} stenographer, who could write I forget how many hundred words a minute; and when I told her {{there were no}} minutes in which I could dictate as many words as that, even if I wanted to, and {{that there would be}} many minutes in which I should not dictate any words at all, she said she was afraid that if she fell into a dilly-dally, poky way of working it would impair her skill, and it might be difficult, when she left my employment, to regain her {{previous}} expertness. She was quite willing, however, to <b>engage</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and thought that if I would try to dictate as fast as possible I might, in time, be able to keep her nearly up to her normal standard.|$|R

This original version never <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> emotionally as the 2004 version did: Whereas the 2004 version pulled <b>me</b> in <b>with</b> pathos, this original repels <b>me</b> <b>with</b> judicious swearing and “out of left field” plot twists." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by thanking Educational Studies Professors Diane Anderson and Lisa Smulyan for their {{continued}} support and patience. Diane challenged me to think critically {{about what it means}} to read and write the world (and in the world). Lisa consistently <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as a professor, mentor, and friend. You’re both amazing. Professor Donna Jo Napoli has also been a crucial support for me during the completion of this project (and my time at Swarthmore, in general). I am thankful for her willingness to see potential in me even when I didn’t really see it in myself. Eric Raimy and the fall 2002 Senior Thesis Seminar provided a weekly discussion forum as I developed my ideas. This group brought a different perspective to the issues in which I’m interested, which forced me to clearly articulate my ideas. This was an important step in this process. I must acknowledge all the friends and innoncent bystanders who discussed this thesis <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> In particular, I’d like to thank the first year students on my hall for their continued interest in my progress. I am also thankful for the students in the Linguistics course I teach at Swarthmore Rutledge Elementary School. These elementary school students <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in lively discussions about literacy and linguistic ideology. Budding postmodernists, all of them. A monster shout out goes to the administrators and students at the Institute for Recruitment of Teachers during the summer of 2002. The opportunity to be immersed in critical theory with fellow students of color was empowering and inspiring. My use of this theory throughout this project reflects the ways in which I was well-served by this program. Watch out, Chicago. The Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program has provided funding for my study of Sociolinguistics for several years. These funds helped me acquire the knowledge necessary to complete this project, and made graduate school a realizable possibility for me. Finally, thanks to Briar and Mara, my partners in crime. And God, my crimeboss...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, {{by way of}} deep {{reflection}} and truthful recounting, pays homage to six different groups of predominately Indigenous incarcerated women and detained male youth, who <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in an active process of collective songwriting and recording between 2008 and 2015. This inclusive creative process was designed to enable participants— {{who are at risk}} of having their voices, histories and identities erased—to participate in a life-­‐affirming demonstration of their own self-­‐expression by co-­‐creating a song together. Indigenous Inquiry or Critical Indigenous Pedagogy (CIP) was the methodology utilized, in order to examine my motivations for wanting to discover and share what constitutes a ‘freedom song’. In doing so, this thesis shares specific knowledge I gained as a result of my lifelong dedication to furthering the dissemination of nêhiyawin (Cree Worldview), through my favourite mode of creative expression: song-­‐ writing. In addition to this written thesis, the original songs are included...|$|R
40|$|To my parents, who gifted <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{curiosity and}} the stubbornness to follow where it leads. Acknowledgments It almost {{goes without saying}} that a piece of work this size could not have been {{finished}} without the help of innumerable people. I wanted to extend my gratitude to those who had the greatest impact on my thinking and writing over the past eight years. First, to my advisor Jordan Pollack. Jordan’s visionary quest for “mindless intelligence, ” a search for artificial intelligence without modeling the human brain or mind, kept <b>me</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> a set of ideas and a set of people I would otherwise never have encountered. Jordan’s enthusiasm and deep understand-ing, not to mention his uncanny ability to direct attention to fertile areas of research, are truly contagious and inspiring. To Timothy Hickey and Marc Toussaint, who sat on my dissertation ex-amining committee. Tim’s careful scrutiny uncovered what would have been an embarrassing error. Marc, who has been interested in my work for several years, painstakingly scoured the entirety of this dissertation, offering a myriad small and large improvements along with suggestive interpretations of these ideas from perspectives I had not considered. ...|$|R

60|$|On the {{following}} morning I was dressed at six, and, looking out of my bed-room, I saw the boat in which we were to be wafted into Asia being brought up to the quay close under my window. It had been arranged that we should start early, {{so as to avoid}} the mid-day sun, breakfast in the boat,--Mahmoud in this way <b>engaged</b> to provide <b>me</b> <b>with</b> two refections,--take our rest at noon in a pavilion which had been built close upon the well of the patriarch, and then eat our dinner, and return riding upon camels in the cool of the evening. Nothing could sound more pleasant than such a plan; and knowing as I did that the hampers of provisions had already been sent over, I did not doubt that the table arrangements would be excellent. Even now, standing at my window, I could see a basket laden with long-necked bottles going into the boat, and became aware that we should not depend altogether for our morning repast on that gritty coffee which my friend Mahmoud's followers prepared.|$|R
60|$|My indiscretion {{rather than}} valour had <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> so far {{at the battle}} of Leipsic, that being in the van of Sir John Hepburn's brigade, almost three whole {{companies}} of us were separated from our line, and surrounded by the enemies' pikes. I cannot but say also that we were disengaged rather by a desperate charge Sir John made with the whole regiment to fetch us off, than by our own valour, though we were not wanting to ourselves neither, but this part of the action being talked of very much to the advantage of the young English volunteer, and possibly more than I deserved, was the occasion of all the distinction the king used <b>me</b> <b>with</b> ever after.|$|R

6000|$|All {{this did}} not improve the gritty state of things in London, or the air that London had {{acquired}} in Rosa’s eyes of waiting for something that never came. Tired of working, and conversing with Miss Twinkleton, she suggested working and reading: to which Miss Twinkleton readily assented, as an admirable reader, of tried powers. But Rosa soon made the discovery that Miss Twinkleton didn’t read fairly. She cut the love-scenes, interpolated passages in praise of female celibacy, and was guilty of other glaring pious frauds. As an instance in point, take the glowing passage: ‘Ever dearest and best adored,—said Edward, clasping the dear head to his breast, and drawing the silken hair through his caressing fingers, from which he suffered it to fall like golden rain,—ever dearest and best adored, let us fly from the unsympathetic world and the sterile coldness of the stony-hearted, to the rich warm Paradise of Trust and Love.’ Miss Twinkleton’s fraudulent version tamely ran thus: ‘Ever <b>engaged</b> to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the consent of our parents on both sides, and the approbation of the silver-haired rector of the district,—said Edward, respectfully raising to his lips the taper fingers so skilful in embroidery, tambour, crochet, and other truly feminine arts,—let me call on thy papa ere to-morrow’s dawn has sunk into the west, and propose a suburban establishment, lowly it may be, but within our means, where he will be always welcome as an evening guest, and where every arrangement shall invest economy, and constant interchange of scholastic acquirements with the attributes of the ministering angel to domestic bliss.’ ...|$|R
