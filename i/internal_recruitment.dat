40|$|Background and problem: Two years ago, {{we made a}} small {{case about}} the Hotel Scandic Rubinen.

With this in mind, we wanted to examine whether <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> could be a key factor to success, and if it solely could motivate employees to a large extent. This led us into two questions that we wanted to answer: • Is a wellknown <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> strategy sufficient as an incentive compensation system in hotels? • Is there a discrepancy between the managements and the employees’ view of the incentive system in the hotel industry? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to get an insight of the hotel industry, and examine whether <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> solely could motivate employees. Methodology and delimitations: This thesis is based on two approaches. One of them is a qualitative approach based on interviews, and the other one is a quantitative approach conducted through a survey. They are both included in a case study that we made in two different hotels in the Gothenburg area. Results and conclusions: The conclusions that we found two different types of employees, where one type of them were young and eager to do a carrier in the company, and the second one were those mainly concerned about job security and a stabile income. For the first‐mentioned, promotion could solely work as an incentive compensation system. Regarding the second group, they simply did not care about promotion, but would rather appreciate a higher salary, or chances to receive a higher salary. We could see a discrepancy between the managements’ and the employees’ view of the incentive system, where the employees were not aware that an incentive compensation system existed...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 25). Augere was established in September 2007 by an experienced team of global telecoms executives with the vision of delivering 'broadband for all'. Augere's first commercial network launched in Pakistan in July 2009 and was closely followed by the Bangladesh network in October 2009 under the brand name QUBEE. Working as a HR Executive for QUBEE, I have enriched my knowledge and skills and have got the opportunity to submit a report on “Effectiveness of Online Recruitment System: Evidence from Augere Wireless Broadband Bangladesh Limited” as assigned by my academic supervisor during my internship period. The purpose of a hiring event is {{to reach out to}} prospective employees and bring the specific kind of skills and experiences in the organization especially those which cannot be built from within. For external recruitment QUBEE posts job advertisement in the BDJOBS website and recruits the best possible candidate from the pool of applicants who applied for the position. BDJOBS online recruitment system can shortlist the application forms according to years of experience, skills, and educational attainment relevant to the job vacancy. Besides this, QUBEE also offers the contractual employees a chance to face the interview if their qualification and job match is similar to the position applied. Also other external referral candidates may apply through employees of our company. In such cases, the line managers send the resumes to the HR department for shortlisting. Then channels of interview are conducted before making the final selection. This report makes a comparison of BDJOBS online recruitment system with the <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> system of QUBEE. The effectiveness of online job recruitment system is based on Performance, Reliability, Security and Cost-effectiveness. Speaking about the performance of BDJOBS software, it could facilitate efficient filtering of qualified candidates and could provide a well-matched shortlist of qualified applicants compared to the manual process of <b>Internal</b> <b>Recruitment.</b> In terms of Reliability, BDJOBS system could produce the required results with precision and could filter out applicants’ forms without anomalies and any form of discrimination while <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> also provides correct results but with more expenditure of time and effort. BDJOBS had the mechanism to protect and control programs and data, and it provided its users passwords as security against unauthorized users while the <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> system of QUBEE is not capable to control any kind of mechanism. Recruitment through BDJOBS requires certain amount money to be paid for each job posting no matter the desired candidates has been hired or not. Lastly, {{it can be said that}} online recruitment is more efficient compared to <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment.</b> Online Recruitment is capable of reaching potential employees at a shorter span of time. It is recommended that QUBEE should develop online recruitment system through their own web portal which is more cost effective and also it can build our own talent pool to source for future job opportunities.

As the concern for the success of the recruitment process in public sectors is becoming more salient, the present study compares the use of recruitment practices in public and private sectors through a survey applied to 97 organizations. It also explores the outcomes in terms of quantity and quality of applications received when using various recruitment methods. Common points and differences were identified. <b>Internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> methods and e-recruitment based on job posting on the website of the organization are favored regardless of the type of organization (private or public). The differences weight mostly against public sector as public institutions use less often the recommendations received from acquaintances and networks, post fewer job adds on specialized online job boards, get fewer direct applications from candidates, and participate less often in job fairs. The largest number of applications is received through the use of online job boards, job posting on the website of the hiring organization and job advertising in written press.

40|$|Within {{competitive}} advantage considerations, knowledge {{has emerged as}} one of the more strategic, although invisible, assets for organizations. This is notwithstanding a wider and specifically economistic and cognitive discounting of knowledge as a factor of production — largely ignoring the socially constructed and socially mediated nature of knowledge. Intellectual capabilities and knowledge/information transformations now have a central place within globalizing information economies. Constructing, transforming and commodifying knowledge and information require new organizational understandings and newer cognitive capabilities of strategic management praxis. Part of this cognitive awareness is a deliberate organizational designing for the role of symbolic analysts. As well, there is an emerging need for the Chief Knowledge Officer function going well beyond the Chief Information Officer requirements posited by an information technology-driven restructuring of routine processes, as compared with innovation creation capacities associated with critically non-routine functions within organizations discovered by Cranfield research. The paper considers neglected institutional and organizational dimensions to knowledge creation and knowledge conversion — it reviews the renewed importance of <b>internal</b> <b>recruitment</b> and socialization within institutions and details knowledge codification and application functions within knowledge-creating organizations.

The Dicistroviridae intergenic regions (IGR) have been studied as model IRESs to understand the mechanism of IRES-mediated translation. In this study, the in vivo activity of IGR IRESs were compared. Our analysis demonstrates that Class I and II IGR IRESs have comparable translation efficiency in yeast and that Class II is significantly more active in mammalian cells. Furthermore, while Class II IGR IRES activity was enhanced in yeast grown at a higher temperature, temperature did not affect IGR IRES activity in mammalian cells. This suggests that Class II IRESs may not function optimally with yeast ribosomes. Examination of chimeric IGR IRESs, established that the IRES strength and temperature sensitivity are mediated by the ribosome binding domain.

30|$|Although {{the demand}} for {{apprentices}} was still strongly connected with {{the demand for}} skilled workers {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century (ibid.), this relationship seems to gradually dissolve according to our findings. The relationship between apprentices training and external recruitment of workers could have progressively changed due to changing economic and societal conditions. However, due to the present study’s methodological approach, our findings only depict preliminary evidence regarding the question of whether the different recruitment options are compatible or opposing. Furthermore, it has to be acknowledged that our analysis is only based on cross-sectional data. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the relevant variables such as the demand for workers from the external labour market or the benefit of apprenticeship could change over time and also be dependent of the business cycle. Accordingly, this question can only be examined through further data collection and analyses. Considering Germany’s serious impending demographic crisis with a declining number of schoolchildren, it remains to be seen how the relationship between <b>internal</b> and external <b>recruitment</b> strategies will develop in the medium-term. If this trend should continue and if labour and education policy does not take the appropriate measures the German economy will most likely face serious problems because of increasing shortages of skilled labour.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{randomized}} controlled trial is widely accepted {{as the best}} design to investigate new interventions, conducting a trial in primary care may present researchers with many methodological problems. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to present an alternative trial design to overcome <b>internal</b> validity and <b>recruitment</b> problems. METHODS: In a {{randomized controlled}} trial, fatigued employees absent from work were selected among the population of an occupational health service in the South of The Netherlands. Patients randomly assigned to the experimental condition received cognitive behavioural therapy by a research GP near their home address, whereas patients {{in the control group}} received no intervention. We describe our considerations for building an alternative design. Research GPs and patients were recruited separately for the study. The pre-randomization design was applied. RESULTS: Nine research GPs performed all the interventions. Seventy-six experimental patients and 75 control patients were selected for study participation. Of these, only six patients in the experimental group and seven patients in the control group withdrew from the study at some point during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that recruitment and randomization procedures in the alternative design served their purpose well.
