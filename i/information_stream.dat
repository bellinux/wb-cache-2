At the receiver, joint space-time differential interference cancellation and decoding is performed, realizing diversity and rate gains, without requiring channel knowledge or bandwidth expansion. Our {{focus is on the}} case of two <b>information</b> <b>streams</b> with two transmit antennas per stream on flat-fading channels for simplicity.

50|$|Precoding is a {{technique}} which exploits transmit diversity by weighting the <b>information</b> <b>stream,</b> i.e. the transmitter sends the coded information to the receiver to achieve pre-knowledge of the channel. The receiver is a simple detector, such as a matched filter, and {{does not have to}} know the channel side information. This technique will reduce the corrupted effect of the communication channel.|$|E
50|$|An {{information}} {{filtering system}} {{is a system that}} removes redundant or unwanted information from an <b>information</b> <b>stream</b> using (semi)automated or computerized methods prior to presentation to a human user. Its main goal is the management of the information overload and increment of the semantic signal-to-noise ratio. To do this the user's profile is compared to some reference characteristics. These characteristics may originate from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach).|$|E

5000|$|Filtering systems - An {{information}} {{filtering system}} {{is a system that}} removes redundant information from an <b>information</b> <b>stream</b> before presenting it to a human user. The purpose of these systems is to manage information overload so that users can find more immediately helpful information. An example of this would be news feeds on various platforms. A notebook filter, for instance, allows users to select features to narrow down the list of displayed products. However, filters such as these require the user to have prior knowledge of the domain and the features that are available to select. Another drawback is the potential that a user could encounter zero results through the filtering system.|$|E

Although appearing similar to compact discs or DVDs, LaserDiscs used analog video stored in the composite domain (having a video bandwidth approximately equivalent to the 1 in C-Type VTR format) with analog FM stereo sound and PCM digital audio. The LaserDisc at its most fundamental level was still recorded {{as a series of}} pits and lands much like CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-ray Discs are today. However, while the encoding is of a binary nature, the information is encoded as analog pulse-width modulation with a 50% duty cycle, where the information is contained in the lengths and spacing of the pits. In true digital media the pits, or their edges, directly represent 1s and 0s of a binary digital <b>information</b> <b>stream.</b> [...] Early LaserDiscs featured in 1978 were entirely analog but the format evolved to incorporate digital stereo sound in CD format (sometimes with a TOSlink or coax output to feed an external DAC), and later multi-channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS.|$|E
