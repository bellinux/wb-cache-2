5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing. I have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country and never come back. And <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{occasionally}} makes {{comments that}} he would also make were he not in character. In an interview with The Buffalo News, Colbert said [...] "The weird thing about my character, even on the show, is sometimes I say what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>It</b> doesn't matter {{to me that the}} audience doesn't know when that is." ...|$|E

[...] His Army unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. [...] In 2000, Rangel {{reflected}} to CBS News that: [...] "Since Kunu Ri – and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> with all my heart, I have never, never had a bad day." ...|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> was a great record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|... he big {{watershed}} was the Clash album—that was go out, {{cut your}} hair, stop mucking about time, y'know. Up {{to that point}} we'd still been singing about bowling down California highways. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> meant nothing to me. Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn't really make out a lot if it... o realise that [...] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.|$|E

500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How {{are you going to make}} this hero a hero? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> is so dark, how are you going to handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E

500|$|The title {{song of the}} film, [...] "The Living Daylights", was co-written with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy of the Norwegian pop-music group A-ha and {{recorded}} by the band. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in {{two versions of the}} theme song. Barry's film mix is heard on the soundtrack (and on A-ha's later greatest hits album Headlines and Deadlines). The version preferred by the band can be heard on the 1988 A-ha album Stay on These Roads. However, in 2006 Paul Waaktaar-Savoy complimented Barry's contributions: [...] "I loved the stuff he added to the track, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> gave it this really cool string arrangement. That's when for me it started to sound like a Bond thing". The title song {{is one of the few}} 007 title songs that is not performed or written by a British or American performer.|$|E
500|$|Following the broadcast, the {{producers}} received {{a significant amount}} of mail from fans criticising the apparent cannibalism {{on the part of the}} Anticans in this episode. Several reviewers rewatched the episode following the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed [...] "Lonely Among Us" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He gave it a score of three out of ten and was uninterested in the episode, finding the alien delegation subplot to be [...] "mostly just silly", and the majority of the episode was a [...] "weak-beer mystery that's mostly an excuse for Gates McFadden and Sir Patrick Stewart to act weird and for Brent Spiner to be a silly Sherlock". James Hunt thought that Spiner's Sherlock impression was [...] "completely brilliant", in his review for the website Den of Geek in October 2012. He thought that the episode shared some similarities with the , saying [...] "By which <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> looks cheap and appears to have been written by a child, in yellow crayon." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Slang" [...] {{achieved}} {{a new level}} of cultural significance when it was prominently featured in the film Garden State (2004). In a scene from the film, Sam (portrayed by Natalie Portman) tells Andrew Largeman (played by director Zach Braff) that the song [...] "will change your life." [...] The song [...] "changed everything" [...] for the group, leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film's debut. [...] "Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons," [...] wrote Robert Levine of Spin. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. [...] "We saw a change in our audience. By the time we were done touring for Chutes Too Narrow, there was this new interest," [...] said Mercer. [...] "We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses. We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> just kept growing!" [...] This additional exposure helped Oh, Inverted World move 500,000 units in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

500|$|Further {{accusations of}} child sexual abuse were made in 2003, by 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. The {{allegations}} came after Jackson and the boy appeared in the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, in which the entertainer stated that he shared his bed with children in a non-sexual fashion. The musician was subsequently indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor, one count of abduction, and one count of conspiring to hold the boy and his family captive at Neverland Ranch. During the five-month trial, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the Arvizo family in a hot air balloon. He denied all the charges and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt. One friend, Firpo Carr, expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer, who at the time was living at Neverland Ranch. [...] "I'm surprised they haven't accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> gets ridiculous after a while." [...] On June 13, 2005, the jury found Jackson not guilty on all charges.|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came out in a paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> is sort of a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky." [...] Gary Westfahl quoted Hubbard's work in a book of noteworthy science fiction quotations, Science Fiction Quotations: From the Inner Mind to the Outer Limits (2005).|$|E
