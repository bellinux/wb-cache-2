5|$|While in {{law school}} in the late 1960s, an era of {{escalation}} in the Vietnam War, Burke received a draft <b>deferment</b> as a full-time student. After his marriage {{and the death of}} his father, he applied for and was granted a hardship <b>deferment</b> (3-A), as the sole support of his wife, mother, and two younger brothers. In June 1969, the Illinois Selective Service board of appeals reclassified him 1-A ("available for unrestricted military service"). At the same time, he was accepted into a Chicago-based United States Army Reserve unit, the 363rd civil affairs group, as a private. Political rivals expressed concern that special consideration allowed Burke to join the Reserve unit ahead of others, but an Army investigation found no evidence of manipulation in his favor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for <b>deferment</b> of a prison {{sentence}} until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a request was controversially granted in 2011 to Anna Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for vehicular manslaughter. It was alleged that her request was granted because of her family connections.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{military}} conscription with costly <b>deferments</b> is developed. <b>Deferments</b> may enable the induction of only {{those with the}} lowest reservation wages, avoiding the usual misallocation of resources with conscription versus a volunteer military. With costly <b>deferments,</b> the tradeoff between conscription and a volunteer military involves the cost of <b>deferments</b> with the former and the higher deadweight cost of taxation with the latter. Among the results are: 1) conscription is socially preferable to a volunteer military only if {{a large percentage of}} eligible individuals is demanded by the military; 2) if conscription is used when it is socially cheaper than a volunteer military, welfare is improved if <b>deferments</b> have lower social benefits; and 3) ignoring other costs of conscription (e. g., higher turnover and reduced investment in human capital), the U. S. in World War II may have been near the point at which conscription and a volunteer military were of equal social cost. ...|$|R
500|$|When Cheney became {{eligible}} for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft <b>deferments.</b> [...] In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense; {{when asked about his}} <b>deferments,</b> Cheney reportedly said, [...] "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service". Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received <b>deferments</b> to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, Cheney was not drafted due to his marriage to Lynne Cheney. When the draft was expanded to include married men without children, he applied for four <b>deferments</b> in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant. He was granted 3-A status, the [...] "hardship" [...] exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer {{eligible for}} the draft.|$|R
5000|$|Former US Marine Officer Vaughn took {{an active}} role in seeking <b>deferments</b> for Peace Corps Volunteers subject to the draft. [...] "We have a serious situation," [...] said Vaughn. [...] "The problem of {{induction}} notices to overseas volunteers in becoming a major concern for us. Pulling a volunteer off a productive job at midtour is unfair to the nation, to the host country, the Peace Corps, and the individual." [...] Even though service in the Peace Corps did not relieve a male volunteer of his military obligation, some Selective Service Boards had granted <b>deferments</b> for the two years of voluntary service as being in the national interest. After 25 volunteers were called home for induction and Vaughn said he would take {{an active role}} in seeking <b>deferments</b> before the Presidential Appeal Board - the court of last resort for draft reclassification.|$|R

5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's <b>deferment</b> from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} be able to do so while drafted. When the <b>deferment</b> expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, as Presley's fame was soaring, he {{received}} a draft notice from the Memphis Draft Board, but was given a <b>deferment</b> so he could finish his latest film production, King Creole. During Presley's two-year military service in Germany, RCA Victor and Paramount Pictures progressively released material he had completed prior to enlistment. During his last months in the Army, Presley experimented with new sounds and worked on further improving his performance. He also prepared material for his first session in Nashville, which was scheduled to take place upon his return. Presley returned to the United States on March 2, 1960.

During the Vietnam War The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) became embroiled in controversy for deferring {{large numbers of}} its young members.

5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary <b>deferment</b> to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for electrifying {{the line}} began {{as early as}} 1992, when the California Department of Transportation {{conducted}} an early feasibility study. For two decades, the project lay dormant {{due to lack of}} funding until Caltrain agreed to share its tracks with the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), which was looking for a route for the constitutionally-mandated San Jose—San Francisco segment. The Authority agreed to partially fund the electrification project in exchange for rights to share the track. Construction contracts for electrification were awarded on July 2016 and groundbreaking was expected to occur in March 2017, but was delayed when the new United States Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao indefinitely deferred federal funding just before construction was about to begin. That same month, Caltrain removed the contractor responsible for implementing PTC for failure to perform on-budget and on-schedule. On May 2017, the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) announced its intention to sign the grant and reversed Secretary Chao's <b>deferment.</b> Construction formally began two months later.|$|E

In 1969, Judge MacMahon wrote a letter to Giuliani's draft board, asking that he be reclassified as 2-A, civilian occupation <b>deferment,</b> because Giuliani, who was a law clerk for MacMahon, was an essential employee.
