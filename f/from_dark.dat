5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of variation on the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives that must be completed before the player can continue. <b>From</b> <b>Dark</b> Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of characters <b>from</b> <b>Dark</b> Forces resulted in LucasArts licensing toys {{based on the}} game. Hasbro produced Kyle Katarn and Dark Trooper toys, which are among the Star Wars expanded universe items to be turned into action figures. The Dark Troopers were also included in books and comics. William C. Dietz's novelizations of the Dark Forces storyline were adapted to full-cast audio dramatizations.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E

5|$|Polled Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
50|$|Diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary <b>from</b> <b>darker</b> colors {{due to the}} {{concentration}} or type of these pigment-producing cells, not their absence. Pigment dilution, {{sometimes referred to as}} hypomelanism, has been called leucism, albinism (perfect, impartial, or dilute), ghosting, paling, and isabellinism.|$|R

5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them <b>from</b> <b>dark</b> magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E
