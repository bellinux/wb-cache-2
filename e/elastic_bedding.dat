40|$|In the paper, {{the authors}} provide {{the results of}} {{analysis}} of a real construction facility performed {{with the help of}} a model of a two-layer beam of variable rigidity resting on the <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding.</b> The bottom layer of a two-layer beam simulates the foundation, the upper payer stands for the structure, and the weight of each layer is taken into consideration. The characteristics of the upper layer change alongside its length. Analytical and numerical methods of calculation were applied to solve this problem. The analytical solution is based on the method of initial parameters and backed by the practical data extracted from "Frame and Towerlike Buildings: Mattress Foundation Design Manual". According to the above manual, whenever the length-to-width ratio of a building exceeds 1. 5, one-dimensional pattern composed of a composite beam resting on the <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> may be used. The beam is divided into several sections, and deflection of each section is identified. It is equal to the settlements of the bedding surface. The rigidity change alongside the length of each section is assumed to be permanent, i. e. the beam is considered as the one that demonstrates its piecewise-constant rigidity. The following conclusion can be made on the basis of the calculations performed by the authors: the calculation of the «structure-foundation-bedding» system may require a simplified model representing composite beams and plates resting on the <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding.</b> More accurate models, such as sets of finite elements, are recommend for use in conjunction with simplified ones.

In modern {{design and}} {{analysis}} of structures, the superstructure-foundation-soil interaction {{has to be taken}} into account in a sophisticated way, which is sufficiently accurete but simple enough for practical purposes. The concept of a plate resting on an elastic foundation has been an important tool for the modeling {{and analysis of}} structural, highway, geotechnical and railroad engineering problems. Extensive research in this area has been reported in the literature. In order to model soil behavior, several approaches have been developed in the past. The oldest, most famous and most frequently used soil model is the one devised by Winkler (1867), in which the beam-supporting soil is modelled as a series of closely spaced, mutually independent, linear elastic vertical springs. The Winkler model has been extensively used to solve many soil-foundation interaction problems and has given satisfactory results for many practical problems. In that method, it is assumed that deflection at each point is proportional to the pressure applied at the point and completely independent of the pressures or deflections occuring at the neighbouring points along foundation. In the Winkler model, the properties of soil are described only by the parameter k, which represents the stiffness of the vertical spring. One of the major disadvantages of this model is that a plate undergoes rigid body displacements without any bending moments and shear forces in it when subjected to uniform loads. Moreover, the use of the Winkler model involves difficulties in determining the value of k. Discontinuous nature of Winkler’s model gives rise to the development of various forms of two-parameter elastic foundation models. Some of the major two-parameter elastic foundation models are Filonenko-Borodich model (1940), Hetenyi model (1946, 1950), Pasternak model (1954), Vlasov model (1966). Filonenko-Borodich, Hetenyi, Pasternak and Vlasov have attempted to make the classical Winkler model more realistic by postulating a two-parameter model. Their model takes into account the effect of shear interaction among adjacent points in the foundation. In these models, the first parameter represents the stiffness of the vertical spring, as in the Winkler model, whereas the second parameter is introduced to account for the coupling effect of the linear elastic springs. It is worth mentioning that the interaction enabled by this second parameter also allows the consideration of influence of the soil on either side of plate. In this model, the first and second parameters have to be determined experimentally. Vlasov and Leont’ev (1966) have introduced another arbitrary parameter, &# 947;, dependent on soil material and thickness of the soil layer. However, they did not report the method of determining this parameter. In the work of Vallabhan and Daloglu (1999), it has been shown how the soil parameter, &# 947;, can be estimated using an iterative computational procedure for plates. These three-parameter models constitute a generalization of two-parameter models, the third parameter being used to make them more realistic and effective. When the &# 947; parmeter is determined, the first and second parameters of soil can be easily calculated. One of the basic features of the three-parameter models is the flexibility and convenience that they offer in the determination of the level of continuity of the vertical displacements at the boundaries between the loaded and unloaded surfaces of the soil. In this study, dynamic analysis of structures resting on two parameter elastic foundation are examined and their interactions are observed. SAP 2000 program and excel macro are used to perform analysis. A soil surface parameter &# 947; is obtained by excel macro with iterative procedure method. Excel macro is coded with VBA language and linked to SAP 2000 program with SAP 2000 open application programming interface (OAPI). The SAP 2000 open application programming interface is powerful tool that allows users to automate many of processes required to build, analyze and design models and to obtain customized analysis and design results. The study is composed of five sections. In the first section, informations about one and two parameter foundation models are given. Content and aim of this study are explained at the end of the first section. In the second section, the characteristics of two parameter foundation are explained. Then, the formulations of two parameter foundation are given. The iterative procedure method that are used to obtain soil surface parameter &# 947; is explained in this section. In the third section, how the two parameter foundation is modelled at SAP 2000 program is shown and then the soil surface parameter calculation with excel macro is explained. The first parameter of soil, soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient C, is represented by springs at SAP 2000 model. The springs are created by area springs feature at SAP 2000 program and soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient is entered as the spring coefficient. The second parameter of soil, soil shear parameter 2 CT, is represented by layered/nonlinear shell elements that have orthotropic material features at SAP 2000 program. Soil shear coefficient 1. 2 × 2 CT is entered at shear modulus section of orthotropic material property form and the other sections at material property form is entered as a zero. The soil finite element nodes are restrainted to make only vertical displacements at SAP 2000 program. The plate finite element and soil finite element are modelled very close to each other and then vertical displacements of their nodes are equalized by weld constraint feature of SAP 2000 program. Excel macro has been developed in order to obtain soil surface parameter &# 947;. It consists of two pages. The first value of soil surface parameter &# 947;_i, modulus of elasticity of soil Es, poisson raito of soil &# 957;s, and compressible soil depth H, size of soil finite element a×b, and number of soil finite elements are entered on the first page of excel macro. Shear modulus of soil Gs, soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient C and soil shear parameter 2 CT is calculated by excel macro. New soil surface parameter &# 947;_(i+ 1) is calculated using these values on the second page of excel macro. Excel macro interacts SAP 2000 program on second page. It enters soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient C and soil shear parameter 2 CT which are calculated by first soil surface parameter on related places of SAP 2000 program. Then, it starts SAP 2000 program analysis and gets displacement results di of nodes of soil finite elements. New soil surface parameter &# 947; is calculated by using displacement results di of nodes of soil finite elements. [CT] stiffness matrice is calculated by unit displacement loading on nodes of soil finite element with using SAP 2000 program and excel macro. When &# 947;_i is close enough to &# 947;_(i+ 1), iteration is terminated and soil surface parameter is obtained. In the fourth section, four numerical examples are given. In the first two examples illustrate two parameter foundation that is correctly modelled on SAP 2000. A circular foundation which is solved previous studies is solved in the first example. The results are shown graphically to compare with previous studies. An arbitrarily shaped foundation is solved in the second example and then results are compared graphically with previous studies. In the third example a plate which is solved in previous studies is considered. This plate is subjected to uniformly distributed and concentrated loading cases. The problem is solved with SAP 2000 program for different value of the thickness of the compressible soil layer. The results are compared with previous studies. In the fourth example, three and eight storey building which are resting on two parameter elastic foundation are considered and then dynamic analysis of this structure system is performed with SAP 2000 program under earthquake loading by changing the distance between buildings and compressible soil depth. Before dynamic analysis of structure system, the soil surface parameter of system is obtained under vertical static loads by using excel macro and SAP 2000 program. Then, soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient C and soil shear parameter 2 CT are obtained depending on soil surface parameter &# 947;. Soil <b>elastic</b> <b>bedding</b> coefficient C and soil shear parameter 2 CT which are obtained depending on different distance between buildings and compressible soil depth are considered constant during dynamic analysis. East-west and vertical acceleration records of Kocaeli Earthquake are used at the same time as dynamic loading. The value which is calculated by mutiplying one-third of compressible soil thickness to mass density of the soil is used as vertical mass of the soil. Dynamic analysis is performed by using linear time history direct integration method on SAP 2000 program. Output time step size is selected as &# 916;s= 0, 005 seconds. Hiber-Hughes-Taylor method is used for time history direct integration. After dynamic analysis, free vibration periods of buildings, displacements of various nodes of buildings, shear forces of certain columns of buildings and base shear forces of buildings are compared depending on time with different distance between buildings and different compressible soil depth. In the fifth section, the general results and conclusions are presented. In this study modelling of two parameter foundation at SAP 2000 program are shown. Thus more complex structural system can be examined under static and dynamic loads and their interactions can be observed. Impact of eight storey building on three storey building are obviously seen in the fourth example. Their interactions are shown graphically with different distance between buildings and different compressible soil depth in the fourth example graphics. Linear behavior of structure systems resting on two parameter elastic foundation are observed under eartquake load in this study. In another work, non-linear behavior of structure systems resting on two parameter elastic foundation can be observed under eartquake load. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

In this method a geologic situation is selected so that energy {{that has been}} critically refracted once above the shot and once below shot arrives first.

40|$|Coarse, spherule-bearing, elastic {{units have}} been {{discovered}} at 10 marine sites that span the K/T boundary in northeastern Mexico. We examined {{one of the best}} exposed sites in Arroyo el Mimbral, northwest of Tampico. The Mimbral outcrop displays a layered elastic unit up to 3 m thick enclosed by marly limestones of the Mendez (Latest Maastrichian) and Velasco (Earliest Danian) Formations. At its thickest point, this channelized elastic unit is comprised of 3 subunits: (1) a basal, poorly-sorted, ungraded calcareous spherule bed 1 m thick containing relict impact glass and shocked mineral grains, (2) a massive set of laminated calcite-cemented sandstones up to 2 m thick with plant debris at its base, (3) capped by a thin (up to 20 cm) set of rippled sandstone layers separated by silty mudstone drapes containing a small (921 pg/g) iridium anomaly. This tripartite elastic unit is conformably overlain by marls of the Velasco Formation. We also visited the La Lajilla site east of Ciudad Victoria; its stratigraphy is similar to Mimbral's, but its <b>elastic</b> <b>beds</b> are thinner and less extensive laterally. The Mimbral elastic unit has been interpreted previously as being deposited by a megawave or tsunami produced by an asteroid impact on nearby Yucatan (Chicxulub crater). However, a presumed 400 -m paleodepth of water at the Mimbral site, channeling of the spherule subunit into the underlying Mendez Formation marls, and the overtopping of the basal, spherule-bearing subunit by the laminated sandstone subunit, all suggest a combined debris flow/turbidite origin for this elastic unit similar to that proposed for Upper Pleistocene sand/silt beds occurring elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In this latter model, the sediment source region for the elastic unit is the lower continental shelf and slope escarpment. For the K/T unit at Mimbral, we propose that thick ejecta blanket deposits composed mostly of spherules were rapidly loaded onto the lower shelf and slope from an impact-generated ejecta curtain...|$|R

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Trampolining is a sport entailing multiple somersaults and twists performed from an <b>elastic</b> sprung <b>bed.</b> During the aerial phase gravity is the only external force acting on the gymnast and since this acts through the gymnast's centre of mass, angular momentum is conserved. As somersault and twist production are {{an essential part of}} trampolining {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics for producing angular momentum during the contact phase. Previous research has neglected important factors such as the considerable mass of the bed and springs in the analysis of the contact phase. Consequently the mechanics of the contact phase is not yet clear. An experimental study is presented to determine the forces acting on the gymnast alone and the forces acting on both the gymnast and the suspension system (bed and springs) during the contact phase for plain jumps. Kinematic data was obtained using a three dimensional motion analysis system and inverse dynamics was used to determine vertical and horizontal forces. Kinetic data was recorded using four tri-axial force transducers, mounted underneath the trampoline using custom designed brackets. Peak vertical forces of 25 bodyweights were recorded during plain jumps at the centre of the trampoline and peak horizontal forces up to 0. 5 bodyweights were recorded in jumps with approximately I m offorwards travel during the subsequent aerial phase. A simulation model of the trampoline suspension system was developed comprising thirty eight non-damped linear springs and fifteen point masses. The model was evaluated using experimental data of an impactor (with known mass) dropped at centre and off-centre locations on the trampoline from varying heights. Results showed the trampoline behaves as a non-linear spring. The study presents relationships between vertical force and vertical bed displacement and horizontal force and horizontal bed displacement as well as the location of the mass centre of the bed and springs as a function of the location of the bed centre. These relationships may be used to model the behaviour of the bed and springs in the analysis of the mechanics of the contact phase for trampolining skills entailing multiple somersaults and twists...|$|R
40|$|The porous {{characteristics}} of the permeable submerged breakwater can reduced {{the energy of the}} incident waves. The porous construction also promotes the Ecology cicada chrysalis. Hence the submerged breakwater may prevent the coastal erosion and disaster. For the purpose to investigate the wave attenuation on the water surface elevation and the porous pressure in the sand bed when the waves pass through the submerged breakwater, we derive the analytic solution of wave interaction with a rigid porous medium above a poro-elastic sandy bottom of finite thickness. Then we extend the result to a new mild slope equation and establish a numerical model to analysis the wave transformation and the soil porous pressure when the waves pass through the submerged breakwater on the inclined sand bed. In the theorem, we apply the potential theorem and consider the inertial and friction effect of the flow in the rigid porous medium, while the soil response is based on the consolidation theorem. As results of the interaction among the waves, rigid porous medium and the <b>elastic</b> porous sand <b>bed</b> of finite thickness, the study obtains a new dispersion relationship in the complex type. The new dispersion relation includes the water depth, period, wave number and the parameters of the rigid and elastic porous medium. The analyzed result shows that different incident wave conditons and water depth will influence the wave attenuation. The wave attenuation will significantly occur when the porosity of the rigid porous medium or the poro-elastic medium increases. Moreover, increasing the relative thickness of the rigid porous medium and poro-elastic medium will also reduce the wave height and energy in the propagation. In this thesis, we also derived a new time-dependent mild slope equation to explore the transformation of wave height and the soil pore pressure as the waves passing over the permeable submerged breakwater, which includes the parameters of the rigid and elastic porous medium. The study discusses the influence of the wave transformation with the conditions of the sand bed, the submerged depth and height, width and friction of the submerged breakwater. We also discuss the distribution of the pore pressure under the submerged breakwater. Based on the numerical simulations, the larger wave decay is found over the breakwater. The height and width of the submerged breakwater increase, the wave decade more. The larger the friction coefficient and porosity are, the wave decay larger. For the coarse sand and fine sand conditions, the wave decay larger than in the impermeable bed condition. On the distribution of the soil pressure under the submerged breakwater, the maximum pore pressure forms on the front toe, then decay with the distance. The minimum pore pressure forms on the middle of the submerged breakwater. The subordination pore pressure forms on the rear toe. And the pore water pressure reduces beneath the breakwater as the height or width of submerged breakwater is larger, which are also found for the larger porosity or friction in the porous breakwater. The pore pressure in the fine sand bed is larger than in the coarse sand. 透水潛堤的孔隙結構特性可以消減入射波浪的能量，而其孔隙特性也兼具海洋生態復育的功能，因此離岸潛堤工法可應用於海岸侵蝕及海岸災害之防治。為了探討波浪通過潛堤時，水面波動的衰減與砂床中的孔隙壓力變化，本研究首先推導波浪、剛性孔隙介質與有限厚度彈性孔隙砂床間交互作用的解析解，再延伸推導新的緩坡方程式，建立數值模式以解析波浪通過斜坡砂質底床上潛堤時的波浪變形及土壤孔隙壓力變化。理論方面係應用勢能理論考慮剛性孔隙介質層中的水流的慣性效應與摩擦效應，而砂質反應則以壓密理論為基礎。由於考慮到波浪、剛性孔隙介質與有限厚度彈性孔隙砂床間交互作用，因此本文獲得一個新的複變型態的散播關係式，該關係式包含了水深、波浪週期、波數、剛性與彈性孔隙介質的特性參數。經由解析結果顯示，不同入射波浪條件與水深條件將影響波浪減衰。當剛性或彈性孔隙介質的孔隙率增加的時候，波浪衰減明顯增加。再者，增加剛性或彈性孔隙介質的相對厚度也會增進波浪的衰減。 基於水平底床之理論解析解，本文並推導含有剛性與孔彈性介質參數的時間相關緩坡方程式，建立數值模式以適用於斜坡底床上之透水潛堤情況的波浪變形解析。文中探討不同的砂質底床條件、潛堤的潛沒深度、潛堤高度、寬度、潛堤摩擦係數、孔隙率等對波浪變形的影響，文中並探討潛堤下方孔隙壓力的空間變化。數值解析結果顯示波浪行經潛堤上方時，波浪會發生明顯的減衰，而潛堤高度與寬度越大的時候，波浪的衰減越多。潛堤如具較大的摩擦係數及孔隙率，波浪的衰減也越大。粗砂或細砂底床相較於不透水底床，波浪之減衰會稍大。在潛堤下方之土壤孔隙壓力變化方面，前方堤趾處形成最大孔隙壓力然後遞減，在潛堤約中間部分有一最小孔隙壓力區，而在後堤趾處則有次高孔隙壓力。最大孔隙壓力隨著潛堤高度的增加而減少，潛堤的摩擦係數或孔隙率越大，孔隙壓力也越大。而細砂底床的孔隙壓力較粗砂底床者大目 錄 謝致……………………………………………………………… 1 中文摘要…………………………………………………………… 3 Abstract……………………………………………………………… 5 目錄…………………………………………………………………… 7 表目錄………………………………………………………………… 10 圖目錄……………………………………………………………… 11 符號說明………………………………………………………… 16 第一章 緒論………………………………………………………… 23 1. 1 研究動機與目的……………………………………………… 23 1. 2 文獻回顧………………………………………………… 24 1. 2. 1 波浪與潛堤之互制………………………………………… 24 1. 2. 2 孔隙底床上波浪與潛堤之互制…………………………… 26 1. 3 本文組織…………………………………………………… 28 第二章水平底床之理論解析…………………………………… 30 2. 1 控制方程式………………………………………………… 30 2. 2 邊界條件……………………………………………………… 33 2. 3 解析解之推導……………………………………… 35 2. 4 通解之蛻化………………………………………………… 40 2. 4. 1 無限厚度砂質底床情況…………………………………… 40 2. 4. 2 無砂質底床情況…………………………………………… 41 2. 4. 3 無剛性孔隙介質情況……………………………………… 42 2. 4. 4 無剛性孔隙及砂質底床情況……………………………… 43 2. 5 波浪減衰之計算結果與分析………………………………… 43 2. 5. 1 水深之影響………………………………………………… 44 2. 5. 2 砂質底床之影響……………………………………………. 44 2. 5. 3 砂質底床厚度的影響…………………………………… 45 2. 5. 4 剛性孔隙介質孔隙率的影響…………………………… 45 第三章斜坡底床之數值解析………………………………… 55 3. 1 緩坡方程式之推導…………………………………………… 55 3. 2 數值方法……………………………………………………… 60 3. 3 模式驗證……………………………………………………… 62 3. 4 砂床上波浪通過潛堤之變形探討…………………………… 63 3. 4. 1 砂質底床特性之影響……………………………………… 64 3. 4. 2 潛堤潛沒深度的影響……………………………………… 64 3. 4. 3 水深的影響………………………………………………… 65 3. 4. 4 不同潛堤高度的影響……………………………………… 65 3. 4. 5 不同摩擦係數fp潛堤的影響 [...] . 66 3. 4. 6 不同孔隙率np潛堤的影響 [...] 66 3. 4. 7 不同底床厚度hs/L 0 對波浪變形的影響 [...] 67 3. 4. 8 不同潛堤高度hp/h對波浪變形的影響 [...] 68 3. 4. 9 不同潛堤寬度b對波浪變形的影響 [...] 69 3. 4. 10 固定潛堤寬度b/L，不同潛堤高度hp/h對波浪變形的影響…………………………………………………………… 69 3. 4. 11 潛堤寬度、高度比改變時對波浪變形的影響…………… 70 第四章 結論與建議……………………………………………… 101 4. 1 結論………………………………………………………… 101 4. 2 建議………………………………………………………… 103 參考文獻……………………………………… [...] 104 表 目 錄 表 2. 1 孔隙介質相關參數表…………………………………………. 48 表 3. 1 圖 3. 2 之計算條件……………………………………………… [...] 71 表 3. 2 圖 3. 3 之計算條件……………………………………………… 72 表 3. 3 與Mizutani et al.
