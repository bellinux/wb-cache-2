5|$|When {{referring}} to the language, the name is normally capitalized (Perl) as a proper noun. When {{referring to}} the interpreter program itself, the name is often uncapitalized (perl) because most Unix-like file systems are case-sensitive. Before {{the release of the}} first edition of Programming Perl, it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, capitalized the language's name in the book to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out better when typeset. This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E
5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company planned to take bigger risks with their next flagship device to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out among its competitors, and also planned to take a more direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E

In Dark Avengers #1, Osborn told Victoria Hand that <b>it</b> does <b>stand</b> for something, and when she asked what <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> for, {{he told her to}} [...] "get on that for him". Also, in the Captain America: Reborn Prelude, when Sin, who is captured by H.A.M.M.E.R, asks what <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> for, the agent present says that it's classified and she does not have a security clearance.|$|R
5000|$|Watson's words {{completely}} contradicted sentiments that he {{had expressed}} in his 2006 interview with SA Sports Illustrated magazine, when he had said: [...] "It (the Springbok emblem) has the potential {{and it has the}} ability {{to become one of the}} most powerful emblems this world has seen. … <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> for equality. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> for unity. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> for a once divided nation that now <b>stands</b> together. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> for everything this world doesn't have, and everything this world wants”. Watson added that [...] "Playing for the Boks would be a great honour" [...] and that “Obviously I would love to play for the Springboks”.|$|R

5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{phosphor}} oscilloscope (DPO) uses color {{information to}} convey {{information about a}} signal. It may, for example, display infrequent signal data in blue to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out. In a conventional analog scope, such a rare trace may not be visible.|$|E
25|$|In that case's {{majority}} opinion, Harry Blackmun {{conceded that}} the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting <b>it</b> <b>stand.</b> Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the most}} popular arc of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series as it {{introduced}} the audience to the concept of Stands, which made <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out from its predecessors.

An anime television adaptation by David Production, , aired in Japan between April 2014 and June 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers are {{the only}} NFL team that puts its logo on only {{one side of the}} helmet (the right side). Longtime field and {{equipment}} manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out more.|$|E
25|$|Smyth {{had ordered}} his sappers {{to get ready}} to blow the bridge. In the early morning on 22 February, it became clear that it might fall within the hour. Smyth's choices were to destroy the bridge, {{stranding}} more than half of his own troops on the wrong side, or to let <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> and give the Japanese a clear march to Rangoon. He decided the bridge must be destroyed, and at 05:30 on 22 February, this was done.|$|E

25|$|Designed by Vincenzo Costa and Osvaldo Armanni, {{the synagogue}} was built from 1901 to 1904 {{on the banks}} of the Tiber, {{overlooking}} the former ghetto. The eclectic style of the building makes <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out, even in a city known for notable buildings and structures. This attention-grabbing design was a deliberate choice made by the community at the time who wanted the building to be a visible celebration of their freedom and to be seen from many vantage points in the city. The aluminium dome is the only squared dome in the city and makes the building easily identifiable even from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Schmidt (25 October 1895 – 5 November 1987) was {{an officer}} in the German {{military}} from 1914 to 1943. He attained the rank of Generalleutnant during World War II, and {{is best known for his}} role as the Sixth Army's chief of staff in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942–43, during the final stages of which he became its de facto commander, playing a large role in executing Hitler's order that <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> firm despite being encircled by the Red Army. He was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union for twelve years, and was released following West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer's visit to Moscow in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked {{one on top of the}} other, the only way that makes <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> into the club premises.|$|E

25|$|Byblos Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Byblos, Lebanon. Originally a Phoenician stronghold, the castle was built over a white {{limestone}} cliff along the Mediterranean coastline of the town. It was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century from indigenous limestone and the remains of Roman structures. The finished structure was surrounded by a moat. Saladin captured the town and castle in 1188 and dismantled the walls in 1190. Later, the Crusaders recaptured Byblos and rebuilt the fortifications of the castle in 1197. In 1369, the castle had to fend off an attack from Cypriot vessels from Famagusta. The Byblos Castle has distinguished historical buildings for neighbors. Near <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> a few Egyptian temples, Phoenician Royal Necropolis and the Roman amphitheater. These are testament to the varied and rich history of the town of Byblos.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, St. Louis' seven-game lead {{had been}} sliced to 1.5 games over the hard-charging Astros. Houston won again that day, their eighth in a row. Trailing 2-1 {{in the bottom}} of the 8th inning to the San Diego Padres with two on and two out, Albert Pujols hit a three-run homer, his 47th of the year. New closer Wainwright made <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> up, and the losing streak was over. It was Pujols' 25th game-winning hit of the season. However, the next night Jason Marquis had one last terrible start, the Cards lost to Milwaukee 9-4, and the lead over the Astros shrank to 1/2 game. The sports world was rife with {{memories}} of the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies, who led by 6½ games with 12 to go and lost ten in a row to lose the pennant to, ironically, the Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was {{released}} in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the PLATO system, and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called Remote Imaging Protocol (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix {{in the early to}} mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called NAPLPS was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the Prodigy service, it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the Apple Macintosh platform, including TeleFinder and FirstClass, but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{features}} of the Saint Petersburg Metro make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out amongst others, even those in the former USSR. It is customary to have stations in the centre of a city built very deep, not only to minimise disruption, but also, because of the Cold War threat, they were built to double as bomb shelters, and many old stations do feature provisions such as blast doors and air filters. In most cities, the lines become shallow or even begin to run above ground as they reach the city's outer residential districts. However, {{this is not the case}} in Saint Petersburg. The difficult geology means that 56 out of 63 stations are at a deep level. The design and architecture went through numerous phases. The original stations were predominantly of the pylon type, of which there are 15 stations. Also popular was the column layout, and there are 16 such stations in the system.|$|E
25|$|P-38s {{were popular}} contenders {{in the air}} races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making {{screaming}} turns around the pylons at Reno and Cleveland. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier {{was among those who}} bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it White Lightnin; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. White Lightnin was severely damaged in a crash landing during an air show demonstration and was bought, restored and repainted with a brilliant chrome finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.|$|E
25|$|In raising or lowering, the {{national}} flag {{should not be}} allowed to touch the ground. When being hoisted to half-mast, the flag should first be brought to the peak of the staff and then lowered to the half-mast position. It should again be brought to the peak of the staff before it is finally lowered. On ceremonial occasions when {{the national}} flag is being hoisted or lowered, or when it is passing by in a parade, all present should face <b>it,</b> <b>stand</b> to attention and salute. Persons in uniform who normally salute with the hand should give the hand salute. Persons in civilian attire should salute by standing to attention. The salute to the flag when it is being borne past in a parade is rendered when the flag is six paces away and the salute is held until the flag has passed by. Where more than one national flag is carried, the salute should be given only to the leading flag. When the national anthem is played in the presence of the national flag, all present should face the national flag, stand to attention and salute it, remaining at the salute until the last note of the music.|$|E
