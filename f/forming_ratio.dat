40|$|The cold curving {{process is}} today {{the most common}} way to produce curved members from {{straight}} members. This process which is continuous {{along the length of}} the member changes the distribution of the residual stresses in the cross section and consequently the way they influence the elasto-plastic behaviour. The use of interaction curves made for straight beams for the design of curved members might thus lead to unsafe or uneconomical design of structures. There is thus need for specific design criteria for curved members. In this paper, first the main features of the cold curving process of I-beams will be presented. Then, residual stresses due to cold curving with patterns available in the literature will be compared to finite elements results. Next, these residual stress distributions will be use to build moment-curvature curves and moment-axial force interaction diagrams. To this end, an analytical model based on a non-dimensional <b>forming</b> <b>ratio</b> depending on the aspect ratio of the cross section and on its radius of curvature will be proposed and validated by comparison with numerical models of arches submitted to various combinations of opening and closing bending moments and axial forces.

40|$|Objective: In CSF, {{extended}} (55 kDa) and truncated (33 kDa) tau forms {{have been}} previously recognized, and the tau 33 kDa/ 55 kDa ratio {{has been found}} significantly reduced in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) vs in other neurodegenerative disorders. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the CSF tau <b>form</b> <b>ratio</b> as a biomarker of PSP and to correlate the structural anatomic changes as measured by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to CSF tau <b>form</b> <b>ratio</b> decrease. Methods: A total of 166 subjects were included in the study (21 PSP, 20 corticobasal degeneration syndrome, 44 frontotemporal dementia, 29 Alzheimer disease, 10 Parkinson disease, 15 dementia with Lewy bodies, and 27 individuals without any neurodegenerative disorder). Each patient underwent a standardized clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. In CSF, a semiquantitative immunoprecipitation was developed to evaluate CSF tau 33 kDa/ 55 kDa ratio. MRI assessment and VBM analysis was carried out. Results: Tau <b>form</b> <b>ratio</b> was significantly reduced in patients with PSP (0. 504 0. 284) when compared to age-matched controls (0. 989 0. 343), and to patients with other neurodegenerative conditions (range 0. 899 – 1. 215). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis in PSP vs other subgroups ranged from 0. 863 to 0. 937 (PSP vs others, AUC 0. 897, p 0. 0001).

It is necessary to propagate great amount of buds by mature shoots, it only takes 6 months to reach to the standard level for marketing if the vegetable buds propagated from mature shoots are managed in a suitable cultivation way.

METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 47 patients with BPH and 39 with clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients with BPH underwent either transurethral resection of the prostate or transurethral microwave thermotherapy. Patients with prostate cancer, {{all of whom had}} no metastases on radionucleotide bone scans and no pelvic lymph node involvement, underwent either radical external beam radiation therapy or radical retropubic prostatectomy. All patients had pretreatment serum PSA levels between 1 and 20 ng/mL. The different forms of serum PSA (free PSA [PSA-F], PSA complexed to alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin [PSA-ACT], and total PSA [PSA-T]) were measured using different monoclonal antibodies against PSA and ACT and immunofluorometric assay techniques. Furthermore, three ratios (PSA-F/PSA-T, PSA-ACT/PSA-T, and PSA-F/PSA-ACT) were calculated. RESULTS: By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the performance of the different <b>forms</b> and <b>ratios</b> were compared. The PSA-F/PSA-T ratio had the greatest area under the curve (AUC, 0. 776), significantly larger than that for PSA-T (0. 612; P = 0. 024).
