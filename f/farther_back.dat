5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} poetry goes much <b>farther</b> <b>back</b> in time and is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but <b>farther</b> <b>back</b> in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|During the War of the Third Coalition, Vukassovich led a {{division}} in Archduke Charles' Army of Italy. His division consisted of 14 line and Grenz battalions and four squadrons organized into two brigades led by Hannibal Sommariva and Karl Hillinger. Tasked with guarding {{the east bank}} of the Adige opposite Verona and maintaining a link with Johann von Hiller's corps in the Tyrol, he garrisoned the suburb of San Giorgio with two battalions while holding six battalions <b>farther</b> <b>back</b> in the hills. The rest of his troops watched the river farther north.|$|E

5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have eyes that are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually <b>farther</b> <b>back</b> on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line {{as soon as it}} ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located <b>farther</b> <b>back,</b> near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by {{the shore of the}} lough, and a mass of basalt <b>farther</b> <b>back.</b> The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E

5|$|The Second Army was {{commanded}} by General Charles Huntziger, {{who was responsible}} for the defense of the Ardennes region of the frontier, including the Fortified Sector of Montmédy. The sector was composed of two parts. The eastern portion was defended by the Maginot positions of La Ferté, Chesnois, Thonnelle and Vélosnes, widely spaced and small, compared to the massive fortifications of other sectors like Thionville. The western portion of the Montmédy sector was even more lightly defended, with several lines of fortifications ranging from fortified houses near the border to small blockhouses <b>farther</b> <b>back.</b> None of the western defenses were of a scale sufficient to support La Ferté or to act as a significant block to an invading force without the organized support of mobile army formations. The relatively weak La Ferté position effectively acted as the western end of fixed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the <b>farther</b> <b>back</b> (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located <b>farther</b> <b>back,</b> included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Austrian cavalry regiment that should have protected the infantry from Kellermann's attack also stampeded and carried away other cavalry units. Kaim and other officers were unable to halt the terror-stricken soldiers. Though the army's center was routed, a second grenadier brigade and some unbroken cavalry covered its retreat. The commanders of the right and left flank columns, Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough and Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz managed to bring their troops away with minimal additional loss.|$|E
