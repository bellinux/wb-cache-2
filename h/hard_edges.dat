Discussions turned to breaking down the <b>hard</b> <b>edges</b> of the canal in order to restore some of the natural processes to improve the overall environment of the Gowanus wetlands area. The DEP also initiated the Gowanus Canal Use and Standards Attainment project, to meet the City's obligations under the Clean Water Act.|$|E

50|$|June Harwood (1933-2015) {{although}} {{not part of}} the first exhibition of work considered to be <b>hard</b> <b>edge,</b> Many of her early paintings consisted of shapes that were more or less rectangular, often in silver, gray and black, defined by crisp lines and <b>edges.</b> Characteristic of <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> paintings, they had a flat, geometric look. Harwood's work was included in a 1964 <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> show in San Diego, curated by her husband, Jules Langsner. Exhibitions at Louis Stern Fine Arts include “June Harwood: <b>Hard</b> <b>Edge</b> Revisited” in 2008, and “June Harwood: Splinter, Divide and Flow” in 2015.|$|R

50|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> is {{used when}} there is an abrupt change in brightness, such as a field with a horizon to a bright sky. A soft edge is a wider, {{smoother}} change from light to dark. This is used when the light and dark portions are not distinctly separated, such as a mountain and sky. A soft edge filter is less noticeable than a <b>hard</b> <b>edge.</b> It also has the benefit of making the sky more intense, darkening the sky the closer on the top. Below is a picture of what a <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> and soft edge filter would look like.|$|R
500|$|Art {{director}} Aaron Garbut {{said that}} the addition of first-person inspired the enhanced version's graphical upgrade. Remodelled cars feature interior effects including functional speedometers, fuel gauges and dashboard handbrake lights. The team added new particle and lighting effects, [...] "like fireflies {{at night in the}} countryside, or ambient light pollution over Los Santos at night", according to Garbut. Red Dead Redemption inspired the team to add more vegetation to [...] "break up the <b>hard</b> <b>edges</b> [...] straight lines" [...] of the open world. The original version's vegetation was replaced with more detailed equivalents in the enhanced version. An upgraded weather system lets tree branches and leaves blow realistically in the wind. The team hand placed weeds along fences and walls, and placed grass over many of the open world's terrains. They then layered flowers, plants, stones, leaves and litter over the grass. An upgraded screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) system renders dynamic shadows that may cast through weather effects including volumetric fog, and particle effects including light reflections in water bodies or neon reflections in cars at night. The ambient light pollution over nighttime Los Santos may dissipate in poor weather. A dynamic depth of field system sharpens and softens images to emulate camera autofocus, and improved shaders produce new colours in skin and terrain textures.|$|E
500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The <b>hard</b> <b>edges</b> of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the cabins}} the berths {{were not made}} up, and those who {{remained}} below had to sit on their <b>hard</b> <b>edges,</b> or on the sofas, which were cumbered with, hand-bags and rolls of shawls. At an early hour after breakfast the bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile them in the corridors; the servants all became more caressingly attentive; and people who had left off settling {{the amount of the}} fees they were going to give, anxiously conferred together. The question whether you ought ever to give the head steward anything pressed crucially at the early lunch, and Kenby brought only a partial relief by saying that he always regarded the head steward as an officer of the ship. March made the experiment of offering him six marks, and the head steward took them quite as if he were not an officer of the ship. He also collected a handsome fee for the music, which is the tax levied on all German ships beyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations.|$|E

60|$|Marryat {{is really}} a writer of the Service. What sets him apart is his fidelity. His pen serves his country as well as did his {{professional}} skill and his renowned courage. His figures move about between water and sky, and {{the water and the}} sky are there only to frame the deeds of the Service. His novels, like amphibious creatures, live on the sea and frequent the shore, where they flounder deplorably. The loves and the hates of his boys are as primitive as their virtues and their vices. His women, from the beautiful Agnes to the witch-like mother of Lieutenant Vanslyperken, are, {{with the exception of the}} sailors' wives, like the shadows of what has never been. His Silvas, his Ribieras, his Shriftens, his Delmars remind us of people we have heard of somewhere, many times, without ever believing in their existence. His morality is honourable and conventional. There is cruelty in his fun and he can invent puns in the midst of carnage. His naiveties are perpetrated in a lurid light. There is an endless variety of types, all surface, with <b>hard</b> <b>edges,</b> with memorable eccentricities of outline, with a childish and heroic effect in the drawing. They do not belong to life; they belong exclusively to the Service. And yet they live; there is a truth in them, the truth of their time; a headlong, reckless audacity, an intimacy with violence, an unthinking fearlessness, and an exuberance of vitality which only years of war and victories can give. His adventures are enthralling; the rapidity of his action fascinates; his method is crude, his sentimentality, obviously incidental, is often factitious. His greatness is undeniable.|$|E
6000|$|It figured for him, clearly, {{as a final}} idea, a {{conception}} of the last vividness. He might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and <b>hard</b> <b>edges,</b> all the stony pointedness, the grand right geometry of his spreading Palladian church. Just so, he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that, beguilingly, almost confoundingly, was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces. [...] "You're round, my boy," [...] he had said--"you're ALL, you're variously and inexhaustibly round, when you might, by all the chances, have been abominably square. I'm not sure, for that matter," [...] he had added, [...] "that you're not square in the general mass--whether abominably or not. The abomination isn't a question, for you're inveterately round--that's what I mean--in the detail. It's the sort of thing, in you, that one feels--or at least I do--with one's hand. Say you had been formed, all over, {{in a lot of}} little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the Ducal Palace in Venice--so lovely in a building, but so damnable, for rubbing against, in a man, and especially in a near relation. I can see them all from here--each of them sticking out by itself--all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one's softer sides. One would have been scratched by diamonds--doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all--but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash. As it is, for living with, you're a pure and perfect crystal. I give you my idea--I think you ought to have it--just as it has come to me." [...] The Prince had taken the idea, in his way, for he was well accustomed, by this time, to taking; and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed Mr. Verver's account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it. They caught in no interstice, they gathered in no concavity; the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone. The young man, in other words, unconfusedly smiled--though indeed as if assenting, from principle and habit, to more than he understood. He liked all signs that things were well, but he cared rather less WHY they were.|$|E
60|$|On the 12th of May, Hayes River, {{which had}} been covered for nearly eight months with a coat of ice upwards of six feet thick, gave way before the floods occasioned by the melting snow; and all the inmates of the fort rushed out to the banks upon hearing {{the news that the}} river was going. On {{reaching}} the gate, the sublimity of the spectacle that met our gaze can scarcely be imagined. The noble river, here nearly two miles broad, was entirely covered with huge blocks and jagged lumps of ice, rolling and dashing against each other in chaotic confusion, as the swelling floods heaved them up and swept them with irresistible force towards Hudson Bay. In one place, where the masses were too closely packed to admit of violent collision, they ground against each other with a slow but powerful motion that curled their <b>hard</b> <b>edges</b> up like paper, till the smaller lumps, unable to bear the pressure, were ground to powder, and with a loud crash the rest hurried on to renew the struggle elsewhere, while the ice above, whirling swiftly round in the clear space thus formed, as if delighted at its sudden release, hurried onwards. In another place, where it was not so closely packed, a huge lump suddenly grounded on a shallow; and in a moment the rolling masses, which were hurrying towards the sea with the velocity of a cataract, were precipitated against it with a noise like thunder, and the tremendous pressure from above forcing block upon block with a loud hissing noise, raised, as if by magic, an icy castle in the air, which, ere its pinnacles had pointed for a second to the sky, fell with stunning violence into the boiling flood from whence it rose. In a short time afterwards the mouth of the river became so full of ice that it stuck there, and {{in less than an hour}} the water rose ten or fifteen feet, nearly to a level with the top of the bank. In this state it continued for a week; and then, about the end of May, the whole floated quietly out to sea, and the cheerful river gurgled along its bed with many a curling eddy and watery dimple rippling its placid face, as if it smiled to think of having overcome its powerful enemy, and at length burst its prison walls.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use for {{differential}} tempering was for heat treating cutting tools, such as axes and chisels, where an extremely <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> is desired, but some malleability and springiness {{is needed in}} the rest of the tool. A chisel with a very <b>hard</b> <b>edge</b> can maintain that edge longer and cut harder materials, but, if the entire chisel was too hard, it would shatter under the hammer blows. Differential tempering was often used to provide a very <b>hard</b> cutting <b>edge,</b> but to soften parts of the tool that are subject to impact and shock loading.|$|R
