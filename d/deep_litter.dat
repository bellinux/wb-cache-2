To-day in {{the upper}} story of a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, east shore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three quarters of it with an ingrain carpet, is half cover'd by a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> of books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected manuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be [...] "express'd," [...] {{and two or three}} venerable scrap books. In the room stand two large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense leaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array of writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with cologne-water, others with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred indescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some quite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach, evidently used, (good-sized print, no type less than long primer,) some maps, the Bible, (the strong cheap edition of the English crown,) Homer, Shakspere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's [...] "Spanish Literature," [...] John Carlyle's Dante, Felton's [...] "Greece," [...] George Sand's [...] "Consuelo," [...] avery choice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American monthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of printer's proofs and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its quaint old fashion'd calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work. There are several trunks and depositaries back' d up at the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from Washington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years.) Indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them upon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000 pages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is a little [...] "Leaves of Grass," [...] latest date, six portraits, morocco bound, in pocket-book form.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effects on the reproductive system caused by different living styles, for poultry. The <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system provided lower efficiency in terms of reproduction, and an increase of food intake “feed intake was lower (p < 0.05) in legumes and green pasture than <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> suggesting economic benefit. It was concluded that access to legumes enhanced the performance of layers compared to <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> and green pasture as indicated by the parameters measured.” (Oke, Abstract) This particular study determined that the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method was not beneficial in terms of egg layer production in chickens.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> {{method was}} first used in 1946 by the Ohio Station Brooder House. Before the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method, {{shavings}} were removed every one to two weeks, {{in order to avoid}} dampness and coccidia. Later, it was discover that <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> provides adequate protection from these naturally. The deeper litter provides extra insulation in colder temperatures, as well as extra heat from the decomposition of the litter. Another potential benefit is that when raised under conditions that don’t provide adequate nutrition, <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> poultry is healthier than poultry raised in the traditional method of housing. [...] "By not removing the waste, good microbes come and make their homes in the litter. These microbes actually eat and break down the feces and consume unhealthy bacteria, leaving good bacteria behind." [...] (Natural Chicken Keeping) ...|$|E

5000|$|Experiments {{have shown}} major {{potential}} benefits to utilizing the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method, specifically within piggeries. Pigs {{raised in a}} <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system, do significantly better than pigs raised under similar conditions, on a concrete floor, which is the traditional method. Studies have shown that pigs raised in a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system have a lower feed to gain ratio, produce a higher quality of pork, create a significantly lower amount of gaseous emissions, show improvements in odor nuisance reduction, and have better animal welfare. “Pigs in the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system had greater color score and rate of cooking meat, while they had lower drip loss and cooking loss than loins from concrete-floor system housed pigs.” (ZHOU et al. 426) “Results indicate that pigs raised in the deep-litter system had some animal welfare improvements and an odor nuisance reduction; in the meantime, pork quality also improved from the deep-litter system compared to the pigs housed in the concrete-floor system.” (ZHOU, abstract) Gaseous emissions were also lower within the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system when compared to traditional systems. [...] "NH3 concentration in the deep-litter system was significantly lower than that in the concrete-floor system" [...] (ZHOU et al. 425) “deep litter and outdoor production avoids the large quantities of methane normally generated from effluent ponds in conventional piggeries” (Ian Kruger Consulting, 2) This study helped to prove numerous benefits not only to our atmosphere, but {{to the health and}} animal welfare of the pigs.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} which was attempting to determine the ability for antibiotic resistant bacteria, to accumulate in meat duck <b>deep</b> <b>litter.</b> Levels were measured at 3 different stages of duck life, in 3 different barns. The litter contained high levels of antibiotics, as well as metals. “E. coli isolated from the 3 stages of sampling were highly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, florfenicol, and doxycycline. Increased resistance to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and gentamicin were seen in the isolates from {{the final stage of}} deep litter.” (Linn, Abstract) “This study concluded that <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> could be suitable for the evolution of bacterial antibiotic-resistance under conditions of continuous usage or accumulation of antibiotics and heavy metals without proper management.” (Linn, Abstract) This was another negative trait of the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the microbiological and chemical attributes of a soil with a seven&# 8209;year history of urea and swine manure application. In the period from October 2008 to October 2009, soil samples were collected in the 0 - 10 cm layer and were subjected to the treatments: control, without application of urea or manure; and with the application of urea, pig slurry, and <b>deep</b> pig <b>litter</b> in two doses, in order to supply one or two times the recommended N doses for the maize (Zea mays) /black oat (Avena strigosa) crop succession. The carbon of the microbial biomass (MB&# 8209;C) and the basal respiration (C&# 8209;CO 2) were analyzed, and the metabolic (qCO 2) and microbial quotient (qmic) were calculated with the obtained data. Organic matter, pH in water, available P and K, and exchangeable Ca and Mg were also determined. The application of twice the dose of <b>deep</b> pig <b>litter</b> increases the MB&# 8209;C and C&# 8209;CO 2 values. The qmic and qCO 2 are little affected by the application of swine manure. The application of twice the dose of <b>deep</b> pig <b>litter</b> increases the values of pH in water and the contents of available P and of exchangeable Ca and Mg in the soil...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>litter</b> is {{an animal}} housing system, {{based on the}} {{repeated}} spreading of straw or sawdust material in indoor booths. An initial layer of litter is spread for the animals to use for bedding material and to defecate in, and as the litter is soiled, new layers of litter are continuously added by the farmer. In this fashion, a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> bedding can build up to depths of 1-2 meters. [...] "The usual procedure for built-up floor litter is to start with about 4 inches of fine litter material with additions of 1 to 2 inches later as needed without removal of the old. A depth of 6 to 12 inches is maintained by partial removals from time to time." [...] (Plamondon) Many consider {{this to be a}} natural means to disposing of animal feces. “The <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> cultivation is a modern ecological breeding technique based on decomposing feces by microbiological methods, a post processing method for poultry Manure.” (Li, 1410) ...|$|E

5000|$|This type {{of farming}} {{has created a new}} market for sheds {{specifically}} designed to utilize the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method. Companies are realizing that this method has multiple benefits and is being accepted by various governments as a greener method of farming. “It has won the support of the government and acceptance of market.” (QIN, 1) One type of building being constructed is called the removable <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> breeding shed. It consists of larger areas for the animals, space to let the litter build to heights not allowed by traditional housing, and economic costs compared to traditional sheds. “Successful exploiture of breeding supporting facilities will greatly promote the development of deep-litter breeding technology in local farms.” (QIN, 1) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{structural}} habitat {{use and the}} thermal ecology of Gonatodes humeralis (Guichenot, 1855) in Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil, to examine intersexual differences {{in the use of}} perch features and to simultaneously analyze reciprocal differences on thermal ecology between the sexes. Gonatodes humeralis body temperature was strongly correlated with environmental temperatures (air and substrate), but air temperature had an additional effect on the males' body temperatures after removing the effect of the substrate temperature. Males and females differed significantly in perch height use above ground (males perched higher) but the sexes did not differ in the trunk perimeter used. Gonatodes humeralis tended to use the larger tree trunks available in its environment and selected trunks with <b>deeper</b> leaf <b>litter</b> at the base.

50|$|Black robins live in low-altitude {{scrub forest}} remnants. The are entirely insectivorous, and {{feed on the}} forest floor or on low {{branches}}. Black robins like to nest in hollow trees and tree stumps. They live in woody vegetation, under the canopy of trees - beneath the branches of the akeake trees. To shelter from the strong winds and rough seas around the islands they spend a lot of its time in the lower branches of the forest. They prefer flat areas of the forest with <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> layers.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{benefits}} {{have been discovered}} {{with the use of}} the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system, also called the “build-up method”. One is the increased ability of poultry to fight off coccidia, common bacteria responsible for an average of a 20% death rate of poultry. New studies in Ohio have shown death rates from coccidia as low as 2.9%. As many as 6 successive broods of chicks have been raised on the same litter, each brood showing better results. Chickens raised in this environment have also been less inclined to show cannibalistic traits. (Plamondon) ...|$|E
50|$|Outdoor pig {{production}} has historical traditions, especially in Europe. Both the sows and finishing pigs are kept permanently on pasture, including during winter months for sows. The majority of growing or ‘feeder’ pigs are moved indoors for the fattening period, e.g. to a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system. Animals are more environmentally adapted to outdoor surroundings, as breeding and genetics {{play an important}} role. Additionally, a major difference between conventional, outdoor production and organic production is the high proportion of silage and roughage in the organic feed. Therefore, finding adequate protein and proper nutrition are often challenges for many farmers.|$|E
40|$|Peccaries {{are known}} to play a {{significant}} role in shaping the diversity of habitats and structure of plants in rain forests. However, very little is known about their roles in regulating animal populations. I review the ways peccaries increase disturbance, create habitat diversity, provide resources, act as predators, and might otherwise directly and indirectly affect other animals. To determine effects of simulated peccary extirpation on the detrital food web, I examined the hypotheses that a reduction of peccary density on fenced exclusion plots would cause changes in the amount and quality of leaf litter as habitat for leaf litter reptiles and amphibians. I found that compared to open controls, exclusions had significantly <b>deeper</b> <b>litter</b> and more rapid cellulose decomposition. Exclusions were thus expected to provide more habitat and prey for litter amphibians and reptiles than control plots, but, paradoxically, encounters of reptiles and amphibians were greater on controls...|$|R
50|$|The {{habitats}} of Ovachlamys fulgens include {{pastures and}} crop fields with enough moisture and with <b>deep</b> leaf <b>litter</b> cover. For example, habitats with Yucca guatemalensis provide good conditions for this species.

5000|$|Broilers {{are usually}} kept at high {{stocking}} densities which vary considerably between countries. Typical stocking densities in Europe range between about 22 to 42 kg/m2 or between about 11 to 25 birds per square metre. [...] There is {{a reduction of}} feed intake and reduced growth rate when stocking density exceeds approximately 30 kg/m2 under <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> conditions. The reduced growth rate is likely due to a reduced capacity to lose heat generated by metabolism. Higher stocking densities are associated with increased dermatitis including food pad lesions, breast blisters and soiled plumage. [...] In a large-scale experiment with commercial farms, it was shown that the management conditions (litter quality, temperature and humidity) were more important than stocking density.|$|E
5000|$|Problems {{may arise}} from the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> method such as rotten bed. This occurs mostly in piggeries, and is caused by high levels of water intake and {{discharge}} from the animals, as well as discharging in the same location within the pen. The build-up of moisture cannot be absorbed quickly enough to fully decompose and causes rotting, unpleasant odors, and harmful gases. Experiments {{to solve this problem}} have taken place. One process, is called the heat pulse method. This method, refers to heating the bedding at a constant temperature, which causes a buildup of steam beneath the bedding. However, the steam is unable to release itself, so {{the next step is to}} pulse oxygen into the bedding, allowing the steam to escape. “The pulse method could promote the timely discharge of steam generated inside the bedding.” (Li, 1412) ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The first {{experimental}} evidence {{with reference to}} the user of built-up litter as a sanitary procedure was secured by the Ohio Station in 1946 when it was first used in the brooder house. During the three years previous when the floor litter was removed and renewed at frequent intervals, the average mortality of 10 broods, or a total of 18,000 chicks, was 19 percent. During the succeeding three years with the use of built-up litter, the average mortality of 11 broods, or a total of 10,000 chicks, was 7 percent. Seldom did a brood escape an attack of coccidiosis before the use of built-up litter. Afterward there was no noticeable trouble from coccidiosis in 11 consecutive broods started and raised on the same old built-up floor litter. Old built-up litter is floor litter which has been used by two or more previous broods of chicks." [...] (Plamondon) To build immunity against coccidia, chicks are normally vaccinated. Experiments have shown that <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> is an effective method of exposing chicks to the bacteria at a safe rate. Chicken feces produces ammonia which is known for killing coccidia. “a 10 percent solution of ammonia spray is considered effective for killing coccidia. Being unable to withstand such a spray, they may likewise be unable to withstand the constant ammoniacal atmosphere in built-up litter.” (Plamondon) ...|$|E
