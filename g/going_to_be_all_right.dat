25|$|On April 23, 2012, Bagwell {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car accident. According to the Woodstock police report, Bagwell called his wife at 1:35 PM {{to tell her that}} he was about to suffer a seizure while driving. He was {{subsequently}} taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was placed in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering broken bones in his neck, face and jaw. On April 24, fellow WCW alumnus and former tag team partner Scott Norton released a statement via Twitter to confirm that Bagwell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> On April 25, Universal Championship Wrestling performer and Bagwell's brother John released a statement to confirm that Bagwell's condition was improving, but that he still required breathing and feeding tubes and would undergo surgery once the swelling in his face and neck subsided. On April 28, Bagwell's mother Judy revealed to TMZ that he had been taken off the breathing tube, was able to eat solid foods, and was able to talk. Fellow WCW alumni Sting, the Steiner Brothers, and Diamond Dallas Page have also kept in contact with Bagwell since his crash. On May 3, Universal Championship Wrestling announced via Twitter that Bagwell was able to walk again, but still had a tingling sensation in his arms and hands. UCW also stated that he had four plates surgically inserted in his face and that his jaw was wired shut after surgery.|$|E

In a later {{interview}} with The Independent, Mac {{said that her}} mission was to [...] "represent the landscape of new music honestly", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. [...] "I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, then I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to play it", Mac concluded.|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting. [...] is a welcome sound, too, because it means he's keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, [...] "Man, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> tonight." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{day before}} the shooting, Kreutzer confided in his former roommate Spc. Robert Harlan {{that he needed to}} talk to Fong again. When Harlan tried to calm him down, he replied [...] "No, Harlan, it’s not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right." ...|$|R
5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} famous {{production}} <b>to</b> date <b>was</b> on Broadway, with Julia Roberts making her stage debut. The New York Times reviewer wrote: [...] "And though Ms. Roberts gives a genuinely humble performance, {{there is no way}} that this show <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> about Julia." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Am Mine" [...] {{was written}} by vocalist Eddie Vedder {{in a hotel room}} near Virginia Beach, Virginia before the band's first show after the Roskilde tragedy in 2000.

2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking {{up one morning}} and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of her house guests, Joan had learned that her husband was still {{maintaining}} his small apartment and still involved with Ann Kurth. On the day following the argument, Hill took his son for a haircut, and during the drive, they went to his apartment to pick up some things; the boy talked with his mother about it when he arrived home. Joan invited her friend and neighbor Vann Maxwell over to discuss the matter, and when she arrived, announced an impromptu game of bridge with Settegast and Woolen in the music room. John Hill was listening to music {{at one end of the}} room while the women played cards at the other. Joan began loudly discussing her husband, then slipping into silence whenever he approached. She told the women that she was planning to consult a lawyer on Monday, and Maxwell became uneasy with the situation. She asked Joan to be quiet or she would leave. Joan then started writing notes to her friend, in which she repeated her intention to speak to a lawyer, and to take John out of her will. After a tense evening, Hill put on a romantic record and came over to stand behind his wife's chair. Settegast suggested the couple should dance, and they did. Afterwards they retired to bed. The next morning, Joan told Settegast that Hill had made her [...] "very happy" [...] the previous night. [...] "He told me things I've never heard from the man before in our whole married life. I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> between us from now on." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rumors {{were spread}} that Shadows {{had lost his}} ability to scream due to throat surgery needed after Warped Tour 2003. However, {{producer}} Andrew Murdock put down these rumors by saying: [...] "When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet… Matt handed me the CD, {{and he said to}} me, 'This record's screaming. The record we want <b>to</b> make <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> half-screaming and half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore… the record after that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> singing.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Kylie wrote [...] "100 Degrees" [...] about {{adapting}} to a winter Christmas in the UK after being raised in Australia and {{was inspired by}} Donna Summer's vintage disco classics. Dannii said; [...] "There's not enough party Christmas songs, everyone has Christmas parties, but what music do you put on? This song is perfect for dancing to. And our X Factor performance <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> guns blazing. And by guns, I mean glitter guns. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very sparkly, very Minogue Christmas." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ye-es," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I {{often think}} the {{religious}} johnnies are saving their money {{to put on a}} horse that'll never run after all.

There they sat, and this jolly world might rot round them for all they cared--they thought they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> themselves, in Kingdom Come. But suppose it doesn't come?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Representative Wintle {{was indicted}} on two felony {{charges in the}} Waterville incident—criminal {{threatening}} with a dangerous weapon and reckless conduct—and on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon.

5000|$|Paul Matisse was {{the only}} artist {{commissioned}} for the initial [...] "Arts on the Line" [...] program who created an artwork with moving parts. Almost immediately after the Kendall Band was installed, it broke. The sculpture began to fail so quickly that the Pythagoras instrument stopped working before the other two could even be completely installed. Matisse later commented that, [...] "You’d probably have <b>to</b> say it <b>was</b> folly of me to press ahead and present them with something that had moving parts...(but)...I figured it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right." ...|$|R
500|$|Larson later reported, [...] "He fought {{us all the}} way... He had {{a vested}} {{interest}} in what had been and resisted every change.

6000|$|Captain Lister nodded, {{and went}} up to them as they {{dismounted}} from the gig. [...] "I fancy that it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> doctor," [...] he said, [...] "Wyatt tells me so himself, and what he says is confirmed by Woodall, the gunsmith. It seems the lad is an extraordinarily good shot. I told you last night that he had been practising a good deal, but I did not like to raise your hopes too high until I had seen Woodall. I will bet you a guinea that Wyatt comes out of it all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'm glad. Everything's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> again now. Sybil dear, Kirk and I had {{the most}} awful quarrel the other day. We--we {{actually}} {{decided it would be}} better for us to separate. It was all my fault. I had neglected Kirk, and I had neglected Bill, and Kirk couldn't stand it any longer. But now that this has happened, don't you see that it will be all right again? You can't stand on your dignity when you're up against real trouble. If this had not happened, neither of us would have had the pluck to make the first move; but now, you see, we shall just naturally fall into each other's arms and be happy again, he and I and Bill, just as we were before." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Youre in My Dreams Tonight" [...] was {{inspired}} by one of Johnsons friends who died of an AIDS-related disease in 1991.
