There {{are two types of}} ion channels involved in the neuromuscular junction and end plate potentials: voltage-gated ion channel and ligand-gated <b>ion</b> channel. Voltage <b>gated</b> <b>ion</b> channels are responsive to changes in membrane voltage which cause the voltage <b>gated</b> <b>ion</b> channel to open and allows certain ions to pass through. Ligand <b>gated</b> <b>ion</b> channels are responsive to certain molecules such as neurotransmitters.

40|$|Ryanodine {{receptor}} type 1 (RyR 1) produces spatially and temporally defined Ca 2 + {{signals in}} several cell types. How signals {{received in the}} cytoplasmic domain are transmitted to the <b>ion</b> <b>gate</b> and how the channel gates are unknown. We used EGTA or neuroactive PCB 95 to stabilize the full closed or open states of RyR 1. Single-channel measurements {{in the presence of}} FKBP 12 indicate that PCB 95 inverts the thermodynamic stability of RyR 1 and locks it in a long-lived open state whose unitary current is indistinguishable from the native open state. We analyzed two datasets of 15, 625 and 18, 527 frozen-hydrated RyR 1 -FKBP 12 particles in the closed and open conformations, respectively, by cryo-electron microscopy. Their corresponding three-dimensional structures at 10. 2 A resolution refine the structure surrounding the ion pathway previously identified in the closed conformation: two right-handed bundles emerging from the putative <b>ion</b> <b>gate</b> (the cytoplasmic "inner branches" and the transmembrane "inner helices"). Furthermore, six of the identifiable transmembrane segments of RyR 1 have similar organization to those of the mammalian Kv 1. 2 potassium channel. Upon gating, the distal cytoplasmic domains move towards the transmembrane domain while the central cytoplasmic domains move away from it, and also away from the 4 -fold axis. Along the ion pathway, precise relocation of the inner helices and inner branches results in an approximately 4 A diameter increase of the <b>ion</b> <b>gate.</b> Whereas the inner helices of the K+ channels and of the RyR 1 channel cross-correlate best with their corresponding open/closed states, the cytoplasmic inner branches, which are not observed in the K+ channels, appear to have at least as important a role as the inner helices for RyR 1 gating. We propose a theoretical model whereby the inner helices, the inner branches, and the h 1 densities together create an efficient novel gating mechanism for channel opening by relaxing two right-handed bundle structures along a common 4 -fold axis...|$|E

Here, three M-PPase structures in different catalytic states show that closure of the substrate-binding pocket by helices 5 - 6 affects helix 13 in the dimer interface and causes helix 12 to move down. This springs a 'molecular mousetrap', repositioning a conserved aspartate and activating the nucleophilic water. Corkscrew motion at helices 6 and 16 rearranges the key ionic gate residues and leads to ion pumping. The pumped ion is above the <b>ion</b> <b>gate</b> {{in one of the}} ion-bound structures, but below it in the other.

30|$|We {{have shown}} the BFV captures the {{characteristics}} of the output pulse well enough to classify neurotransmitter inputs on the basis of how they change the BFV (Peterson and Khan 2006) and we will now use modulations of the BFV induced by second messengers in our nodal computations. The feature vector output of a neural object is due to the cumulative effect of second messenger signaling to the genome of this object which influences the action potential and thus feature vector of the object by altering its complicated mixture of ligand and voltage activated ion gates, enzymes and so forth. We can then define an algebra of output interactions that we can use in building the models. We motivate our approach using the basic Hodgkin - Huxley model which depends on a large number of parameters. Of course, more sophisticated action potential models can be used, but the standard two <b>ion</b> <b>gate</b> Hodgkin - Huxley model is sufficient for our needs here.|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} is mediated through {{changes in the}} probability of stochastic transitions between open and closed states of ion channels. While differences in morphology define neuronal cell types and may underlie neurological disorders, very {{little is known about}} influences of stochastic <b>ion</b> channel <b>gating</b> in neurons with complex morphology. We introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes. Comparison of five morphologically distinct neuronal cell types reveals that when all simulated neurons contain identical densities of stochastic ion channels, the amplitude of stochastic membrane potential fluctuations differs between cell types and depends on sub-cellular location. For typical neurons, the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations depends on channel kinetics as well as open probability. Using a detailed model of a hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neuron, we show that when intrinsic <b>ion</b> channels <b>gate</b> stochastically, the probability of initiation of dendritic or somatic spikes by dendritic synaptic input varies continuously between zero and one, whereas when <b>ion</b> channels <b>gate</b> deterministically, the probability is either zero or one. At physiological firing rates, stochastic <b>gating</b> of dendritic <b>ion</b> channels almost completely accounts for probabilistic somatic and dendritic spikes generated by the fully stochastic model.

40|$|Ion gels {{composed}} of ionic liquids and block copolymers {{can be used}} as gate dielectrics in organic thin-film transistors. Conventional dielectrics used in OTFTs do not have capacitances large enough to enable transistor operation at low voltages, which is needed in many organic electronics applications. Mobile ions in the gel form electric double layers, giving rise to a very high capacitance and therefore high charge carrier concentrations at low operating voltages. The goal {{of this study was to}} fabricate a functioning OTFT using an <b>ion</b> gel as <b>gate</b> dielectric, and to examine its properties. The OTFT was prepared with a top-gate geometry, where the ion gel was sandwiched between the gate electrode and the substrate with the semiconductor channel. The semiconductor was amorphous poly(triarylamine), which was deposited by spin-coating. The <b>ion</b> gel <b>gated</b> OTFT properties were compared with a reference OTFT structure, which had a conventional polymeric <b>gate</b> dielectric. The <b>ion</b> gel <b>gated</b> transistor operated with voltages below 2 V and the output current was three orders of magnitude larger than that of the reference OTFT, which required more than ten times the voltage. The capacitance of the ion gel was over 5 uF/cm^ 2 up to 1 MHz. The charge carrier mobility in the OTFT was on the order of 10 ^- 3 cm^ 2 /(Vs), which was similar to that in previous studies with the semiconductor used. The transistor could be switched on and off at the frequency of 1 kHz, but there was a large overlap capacitance across the gel. Hysteresis and leakage were challenges in the <b>ion</b> gel <b>gated</b> OTFT preparation. The ionic liquid is hygroscopic, making the gel susceptible to water impurities.

GIRK is activated by the direct binding of heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, such as M 2 acetylcholine receptor. The binding of Gβγ to the cytoplasmic pore (CP) region of GIRK causes structural rearrangements, which are assumed to open the transmembrane <b>ion</b> <b>gate.</b> However, the crucial residues involved in the Gβγ binding and the structural mechanism of GIRK gating have not been fully elucidated. Here, we have characterized {{the interaction between the}} CP region of GIRK and Gβγ, by ITC and NMR. The ITC analyses indicated that four Gβγ molecules bind to a tetramer of the CP region of GIRK with a dissociation constant of 250 μm. The NMR analyses revealed that the Gβγ binding site spans two neighboring subunits of the GIRK tetramer, which causes conformational rearrangements between subunits.

The first ion mirror, {{which is a}} linear-field, single-stage mirror (MS 1) with an intermediate collision cell, {{has been designed to}} provide the temporal focus necessary for the second, quadratic-field ion mirror (MS 2) to function effectively. Due to the wide energy-range focusing capabilities of the quadratic field employed in the second ion mirror all the fragment ions can be collected in one spectrum without the need to step the reflecting working voltage of the MS 2. The size of the active area of the microchannel plate detector used in the preliminary experiments was the limiting factor governing the collection efficiently of fragment ions. The use of the first ion mirror to provide temporal focusing of the precursor ion packet at the first focal point of the quadratic mirror used as the MS 2 requires no alteration of the focusing conditions for different masses, in contrast to delayed extraction or postsource pulsed focusing.
