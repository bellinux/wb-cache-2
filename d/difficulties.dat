40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver resections are related to both patient and tumour factors, however the available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems only incorporate tumour factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the opinion of laparoscopic liver surgeons regarding the factors that affect the perceived <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver resections. METHOD: Using a Visual Analogue Scale an international survey of laparoscopic liver surgeons was undertaken to assess the perceived <b>difficulty</b> of 26 factors previously demonstrated to affect the <b>difficulty</b> of a laparoscopic liver resection. RESULTS: 80 surgeons with a combined experience of over 7000 laparoscopic liver resections responded to the survey. The <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver surgery was suggested to be increased by a BMI > 35 by 89 % of respondents; neo-adjuvant chemotherapy by 79 %; repeated liver resection by 99 % and concurrent procedures by 59 % however these factors have not been included in the previous <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems. CONCLUSION: The results suggests that the <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver surgery is not fully assessed by the available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems and prompts the development of a new <b>difficulty</b> score that incorporates all factors believed to increase <b>difficulty.</b> </p...|$|R
