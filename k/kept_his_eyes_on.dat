60|$|He {{remained}} silent, and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{his plate}} during the meal.|$|E
60|$|Scott {{opened his}} arms to her, but <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> White Fang.|$|E
60|$|Michael snarled {{acknowledgment}} of the threat, crouched to spring, and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the iron weapon.|$|E
60|$|He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the visi-plate. They were {{descending}} too quickly. There was no {{room for}} doubt. Much too quickly.|$|R
60|$|He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> {{the tall}} boy, {{and as soon}} as Ferris was a short {{distance}} ahead Hal left the door-way and followed him.|$|R
60|$|With {{a twinkle}} in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> the old gentleman related the {{incident}} of the morning, while Angus, with a grim expression, <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Beauty, who gazed inquiringly out at the half-open door of her retreat.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{the party}} started {{at a brisk}} run. Francis <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{the spot where he}} {{believed}} the hut lay.|$|E
60|$|Shirley {{raised his}} head, but still <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the {{treasure}} beneath him, and swore worse than before. The captain was shocked.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{flicked the}} ash off his {{cigarette}} and looked thoughtful. He stroked his grey imperial and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> his companion.|$|E
6000|$|The fire hissed and shrieked {{more and}} more, like a strangled thing, as it grew {{narrower}} and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets, but Father Brown still <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> {{it as he}} went on speaking: ...|$|R
60|$|Jip <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> them, {{and gave}} an {{occasional}} poke with his cold nose {{to be sure}} they were there as they drove through the bustling streets of New York to a great house with an inscription over the door.|$|R
60|$|Dirck did not answer, {{until we}} had trotted twenty rods; for {{by this time the}} pipe was at work, and the moment that smoke was seen he <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> it, until he saw a bright light in front of his nose.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> her till he {{had made}} sure--and this deep {{exchange}} between them had a beauty. [...] "So you're now with me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Edgar looked anxiously at his companion's face, but {{received}} no encouragement there, for Baldwin <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the ground, {{and shook his}} head slowly.|$|E
6000|$|After {{a little}} while, Esteban, who <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the water, plucked at his uncle's sleeve. [...] "There they go!" [...] he cried, and pointed.|$|E
60|$|Luncheon at 94 Grosvenor Square, {{notwithstanding}} the cocktails, was an exceedingly simple meal, a fact which the Marquis himself seemed scarcely to notice. He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> visitor's plate, however, {{and passed the}} cutlets with an unnoticeable sigh of regret.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll do for one," [...] {{retorted}} Ben, and Billy and Bab {{joined in}} his laugh so heartily that a rough-looking, man who sat behind them, hearing all they said, pronounced them a [...] "jolly set," [...] and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Sancho, who now {{showed signs of}} insubordination.|$|R
60|$|Compressing {{his lips}} {{like a man}} resolved, the {{commander}} of the Coquette bent further forward, and glanced at the wheel. The quarter-master, who held the spokes, was erect, steady, and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the leech of the head-sail, as unerringly as the needle points to the pole.|$|R
60|$|The words choked Philip, {{but he was}} {{determined}} not to shirk the truth. He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Lawson and saw his embarrassment. Philip smiled savagely.|$|E
6000|$|While they rested, Bailey <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> their {{backward}} trail, {{watching for}} his partner, Rivers. [...] "It's about time Jim showed up," [...] he said, once again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{said the}} fellow who with a quid of tobacco bulging out his left cheek <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the compass card. [...] "This minute. He laughed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{were pretty}} heavy, Jack. Once or twice I thought of dumping {{my share of}} them, but it's {{fortunate}} that Hollin, who seemed to suspect my intentions, <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> me when I got played out. You see, an assayer we took them to found that they were rich in lead and silver." ...|$|R
60|$|Matteo and I {{looked at}} one another. Checco <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed <b>on</b> the Count.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I ask, Miss Newcome, what {{particular}} reason {{you have for}} so thinking?" [...] asked Mr. Warren, who had <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the young lady the whole time she had been thus running on, with an interest that struck me as somewhat exaggerated, when one remembered {{the character of the}} speaker, and the value of her remarks.|$|R
60|$|He <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the alert, {{but none}} of the signs for which he was searching appeared, nor did {{anything}} that looked like a mine entrance show itself.|$|E
6000|$|Jeff <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> hers, but he {{answered}} to his mother: [...] "Not {{any more than}} I deserved. I hadn't any right to expect that she would stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Horne Fisher did {{not seem}} entirely {{satisfied}} with this very sudden repentance; he <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the man and only said, in a low voice, [...] "What crime do you mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} moving away, one of the private marines, who had <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Anne, and noticed her distress, {{contrived}} to say in a whisper as he passed her, 'We are coming back again {{as soon as it}} begins to get light; that's only said to deceive 'ee. Keep your young man out of the way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Wyllard <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> her. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "I can't. In fact, when I {{sit down}} to think I can see {{at least a dozen}} reasons why it doesn't concern me. In a case of this kind that's always easy. It's just borne in upon me--I don't know how--that I have to go." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} curiously and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed <b>on</b> me while he {{answered}} my question.|$|R
60|$|They filed {{into the}} {{apartment}} mentioned, a long, low room, the walls of which were lined with shelves filled with musty volumes. Dave <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Jasniff, and this the runaway noticed.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Theign {{had during}} this speech <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the ground; but he raised them to Mr. Crimble's almost palpitating {{presence}} for the remark: [...] "I'm bound {{to say that}} I hope you've some very good grounds!" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{reflecting}} sagely, he <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{his plate}} and did {{justice to the}} fare; for one cannot scorch from the Cliff House to the Western Addition via the park without being guilty of a healthy appetite.|$|E
60|$|She {{burst into}} a torrent of insult, foul and insolent. Davidson <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> grave <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|Art {{historian}} Mark Cheetham {{maintains that}} Jack Chambers's [...] "theory of 'perceptual realism' challenges parochial notions of regionalism." [...] Chambers [...] "was closely {{involved with the}} London art scene but was trained in Spain and <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the work of friends there. His reputation as an avant-garde filmmaker was international, and his constant technical experimentation was in line with developments in the United States." ...|$|R
60|$|Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was {{watching}} the local doctor narrowly. He still <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed <b>on</b> him as he spoke.|$|R
