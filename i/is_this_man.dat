2500|$|In 1873 Darwin's son George {{wrote an}} essay which boldly {{dismissed}} prayer, divine morals and [...] "future rewards & punishments". Darwin wrote [...] "I would urge {{you not to}} publish it for some months, at the soonest, & then consider whether you think it new & important enough to counterbalance the evils; remembering the cart-loads which have been published on this subject. – The evils on giving pain to others, & injuring your own power & usefulness...

6000|$|Great was Scoutbush's wrath {{when he saw}} Marie {{rise and}} obey orders. [...] "Who <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man?</b> what right had he to command her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we cannot}} do well without such friends, we shall never do well with them. Believe me, whoever he may <b>be,</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> no soldier." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Who <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{that one}} word of his could bore {{its way to the}} very heart of my being and resound there for years like a rousing gong?" [...] - Sister Gargi ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} the evidence," [...] the count said, turning to Demetri. [...] "What is your opinion? <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{innocent}} or guilty?" ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{what the}} Pharisee would have said. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> fit {{to come to the}} Communion? At least he himself thinks so.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shock and}} disgust me," [...] said Serviss, profoundly moved. [...] "The girl seems too fine for such chicanery. Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Clarke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did {{you really}} now?' said Dr. Greatrex, languidly. 'Well, I dare say, for I know there's a sad {{prevalence}} of revolutionary feeling among our workmen here, Mr, Blenkinsopp. Now, what <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Schurz talking about?' ...|$|R
60|$|Ever {{since she}} had made her first drive at golf, she had prided herself on her use of the wood. Her brother and her brassey were the only things she loved. And here <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> deliberately.... Eunice choked.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time he turned and faced her, and there was a look in his eyes which touched Sally and drove all sense of the ludicrous out of her. Absurd as it <b>was,</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> really serious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Dunn hurriedly. [...] "But I'm a d--d fool, or worse, {{the fool}} of a fool. Tell me, Teresa, <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Low your lover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now silence {{came upon}} the place again, for all were fearful. At last one cried: 'How <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> named who has won the body from the ghosts?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brice," [...] he said, {{with that}} sorrowful smile, [...] "a technicality might save Colfax, but it won't save me. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{a friend of}} yours?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|What was {{the meaning}} of <b>this</b> mystery? What <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> to him? Was he {{the man who had}} once lost a child through a crazy nurse? In his perplexed state of mind, the {{questions}} were maddening ones to the boy.|$|R
60|$|Lady.--Well, I <b>am</b> {{satisfied}} <b>this</b> <b>man</b> has <b>been</b> ill {{used in the}} world.|$|R
5000|$|Football {{became a}} lasting part of Pickens in 1923.

6000|$|... "Thou speakest {{of strange}} matters, O praefect," [...] she rejoined, [...] "and meseems there's treason in what thou sayest. Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> whose very look hath made a slave of thee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{glad you}} came. I {{wanted to ask}} you something. Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Concho. Ah! Carramba! Do you {{not see the}} trick,--eh, the conspiracy? It <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> as Diego, your daughter's groom, {{helped his}} friend Mr. Oakhurst to the heiress. Ah, you comprehend! It was an old trick! You shall see, you shall see! Ah! I am wise, I am wise! ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause. Reist was conscious that his impetuous speech was scarcely a happy one. For it <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> indeed who <b>was</b> the outcast--whose name even had become strange {{to the people}} over whom his forefathers had ruled. Erlito showed no resentment, {{but his eyes were}} very sorrowful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! But when <b>this</b> <b>mans</b> {{with the}} wife which <b>is</b> Indian, <b>this</b> <b>mans</b> McCormack, when him discovaire the Klondike, you go not. Odder mans go; odder mans now rich." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "but {{they are}} both in the field with my young sister. But who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> walking up the shore? And is that the boat you came in?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{could not}} have stayed in Paris and waited for news. Tell me exactly what has happened. Even now I do not understand. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Hill dead?" ...|$|E
50|$|Petrus Forestus died on 10 March 1597. He {{was over}} 75 years old. His remains {{were buried in}} the Great or St. Lawrence Church in Alkmaar on March 13, 1597. The last line on his {{tombstone}} reads: Hippocrates batavus si fuit ille fuit (If {{ever there was a}} Dutch Hippocrates, it <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man).</b>|$|R
50|$|SAS Makhanda <b>was</b> {{named after}} <b>this</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Looking at him--he was {{so terrible}} of aspect--she could not {{comprehend}} his words. Who <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{with the face}} gray as death, with eyes {{that would have made}} her shriek had she the strength, with the strange, ruthlessly bitter lips? Where was the gentle Lassiter? What <b>was</b> <b>this</b> presence in the hall, about him, about her--this cold, invisible presence? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Heaven!" [...] thought Oldbuck, [...] "how <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> altered {{from the}} formal stolidity of his usual manner!--he grows wanton under adversity--Sed pereunti mille figurae."--He then {{proceeded}} aloud--"Sir Arthur, we must necessarily speak {{a little on}} business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is the change!" [...] sighed he, {{striking}} {{his hand}} upon his breast. [...] "Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{of thought and}} care, weary with world-wandering, and heavy with disappointed hopes? The youth returns not, who went forth so joyously!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A police captain named Maroney," [...] {{he said to}} {{the desk}} sergeant, [...] "was {{dismissed}} from the force after being tried under charges three years ago. I believe sentence was suspended. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> wanted now by the police?" ...|$|E
50|$|Recalled Moloney:I {{think at}} that time Van was searching for his Irish roots. It <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> of blues, of rock ‘n’ roll, jazz and more {{importantly}} soul, coming home to his Irishness with The Chieftains and the music we’d been playing for so many years. Musically {{we were going to}} meet each other half way.|$|R
60|$|Now, here <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{actually}} {{turning a}} poor lad adrift without a copper, {{after he had}} been slaving aboard his ship for more than four mortal months. But Captain Riga was a bachelor of expensive habits, and had run up large wine bills at the City Hotel. He could not afford to be munificent. Peace to his dinners.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I don't see what, father," [...] Mary said, after {{thinking}} for some time, [...] "unless she is fancying since that it <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> who did it. Of course, anyhow, {{it would be}} a fearful shock for a girl to find her mistress lying murdered, and perhaps it may be nothing more than that." ...|$|R
