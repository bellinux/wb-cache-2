50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of the telephone attempts were made to adapt the technology for military use. Telephones were already being used to support military campaigns in British India and in British colonies in Africa in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In the United States telephone lines connected fortresses {{with each other and with}} army headquarters. They were also used for fire control at fixed coastal defence installations. The first telephone for use in the field was developed in the United States in 1889 but it was too expensive for mass production. Subsequent developments in several countries made the field telephone more practicable. The wire material was changed from iron to copper, devices for laying wire in the field were developed and systems with both battery-operated sets for command posts and <b>hand</b> <b>generator</b> sets for use in the field were developed. The first purposely-designed field telephones were used by the British in the Second Boer War. They were used more extensively in the Russo-Japanese War, where all infantry regiments and artillery divisions on both sides were equipped with telephone sets. By the First World War the use of field telephones was widespread.|$|E

50|$|In early {{telephone}} systems, connections {{were made}} in the central office by switchboard operators using patch cords to connect one party to another. A telephone call was initiated by operating a magneto <b>hand</b> <b>generator,</b> usually integral to the customer telephone, to alert the central office operator by the ringing of a switchboard bell or the activation of a drop. In response, the operator inserted a patch cord into the corresponding line jack and assisted the customer by voice. The other end of the patch cord connected the caller to the destination telephone line. If the destination party belonged to another exchange, the operator established a connection to that exchange where another operator completed the call setup. As technology advanced, automatic electro-mechanical switches were introduced and telephones were equipped initially with rotary dials for pulse-dialing and then Touch-Tone key pads in the 1960s, which increased the speed of dialing and enabled other vertical telephone features. For telephone subscribers, prior to widespread use of area codes and the 10 digit phone number, the first 3 digits of the 7 digit telephone number were called the exchange, which used the first two letters of the exchange name and one digit, e.g., GLadstone 7 (an exchange in the Chicago area), which was 457 with all numeric representation of telephone numbers. Subscribers needed only 7 digits to make calls within their area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a video hand segmentation tool which can help with generating hands ground truth from sign language image sequences. This tool may greatly facilitate {{research in the area}} of sign language recognition. In this tool, we offer a semi automatic scheme to assist with the localization of hand pixels, which is important for the purpose of recognition. A candidate <b>hand</b> <b>generator</b> is applied by using the mean shift image segmentation algorithm and a greedy seeds growing algorithm. After a number of hand candidates is generated, the user can reduce the candidates by simple mouse clicks. The tool also provides a hand tracking function for faster processing and a face detection function for groundtruthing non manual signals. In addition, we provided a two-passes groundtruthing scheme unlike other tools that only does one-pass. Our first pass processing is automatic and does not need user interaction. The experiment results demonstrate that based on the first pass’s result, one can groundtruth 10, 000 + frames of sign language within 8 hours. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{three tests}} of randomness - tests that many random number generators fail.

On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>generators</b> that pass the three tests seem to pass all the tests in the Diehard Battery of Tests. Note that these tests concern the randomness of a generator's output as a sequence of independent, uniform 32 -bit integers. For uses where the output is converted to uniform variates in [0, 1), potential flaws of the output as integers will seldom cause problems after the conversion. Most generators seem to be adequate for producing a set of uniform reals in [0, 1), but several important applications, notably in cryptography and number theory - for example, establishing probable primes, complexity of factoring algorithms, random partitions of large integers - may require satisfactory performance on the kinds of tests we describe here. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

As being more supply chain independent and having an active dose sensing component that monitors the water to insure sterilization, our device boasts far more than any current off-the-shelf devices. The device is completely hand powered via a <b>hand</b> crank <b>generator.</b> A spermicidal ultraviolet light bulb, rated at 253. 7 nm (UV-C), was integrated with a common NalgeneTM water bottle. Along with the bulb, UV. dose sensing electronics and a <b>hand</b> crank <b>generator</b> were incorporated as well, with the generator supplying power to both the bulb and the photodiode circuitry. Results show that eradication of common waterborne bacteria, protozoa, and viruses occurs after cranking the generator for approximately 41 seconds in clear water and up to 65 seconds in turbid water.

40|$|Background Much {{research}} in the field of energy harvesting has sought to develop devices capable of generating electricity during daily activities with minimum user effort. No previous study has considered the metabolic cost of carrying the harvester when determining the energetic ef-fects it has on the user. When considering device carrying costs, no energy harvester to date has demonstrated the ability to generate a substantial amount of electricity (> 5 W) while maintaining a user effort at the same level or lower than conventional power genera-tion methods (e. g. <b>hand</b> crank <b>generator).</b> Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a lower limb-driven energy harvester that is able to generate approximately 9 W of electricity. To quantify the performance of the harvester, we introduced a new perfor-mance measure, total cost of harvesting (TCOH), which evaluates a harvester’s overall effi-ciency in generating electricity including the device carrying cost. The new harvester captured the motion from both lower limbs and operated in the generative braking mode t...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with conditions for the admissibility of a translation invariant function space M {{with respect to a}} well posed linear evolution equation du/dt=Au+f(t), t∈R (*). We propose a new approach to this problem by considering the sum of two commuting operators −d/dt≔−DM and the operator of multiplication by A on M. On the one hand, the closure of this operator is the infinitesimal generator of the so-called evolution semigroup associated with (*). On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>generator</b> G of this semigroup relates a mild solution u of (*) to the forcing term f by the rule Gu=−f. Consequently, various spectral criteria of the type σ(DM) ∩σ(A) =∅ for the admissibility of the function space M with respect to (*) can be proved in an elegant manner. Moreover, they can be naturally extended to general classes of differential equations, including higher order and abstract functional differential equations. Applications and examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results...|$|R
