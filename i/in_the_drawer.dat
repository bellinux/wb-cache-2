25|$|On December 21, 1911, Fremont Weeks, the {{plaintiff}} in error and defendant, {{was arrested by}} a police officer at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, where an express company employed him. Weeks was convicted of using the mails {{for the purpose of}} transporting lottery tickets, in violation of the Criminal Code. At the time of his arrest, police officers went to Weeks' house to search it. A neighbor told them where to find the key. Officers entered the house of the defendant without a search warrant and took possession of papers and articles, which were turned over to the US Marshals. The officers returned later on the same day with the marshal, still without a warrant, and seized letters and envelopes that they found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of a chiffonier.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

At the age of ten, {{he went to work}} as a clerk and errand boy in various stores to help support his family. He also worked as a carpenter and a carriage maker. However, Luther later wrote, [...] "my desires for further education prevented me from so concentrating my mind at these trades as to make a success of them. I remember keeping books <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of my work bench and at every spare moment, I would take occasion to read from them.

40|$|The Leakless Cooling System (LCS) for the TILECAL hadron {{calorimeter}} is described {{with the results}} obtained during the 1997 test beam period. The presentation shows that the LCS is the more adequate cooling system for the TILECAL calorimeter design. The results give a stability of <b>the</b> temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> and inside <b>the</b> PMT blocks better than 0 : 25 0 C, involving a drift on the PMT gain less than 0 : 05 %. 1 1 Introduction All the electronics inside <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> of <b>the</b> TILECAL modules is expected to dissipate a non negligible amount of heat. A study of the power consumption, see table 1, gives approximatively a maximum of 200 W per super-drawer. During the Module 0 test beam in 1996, two temperature probes (one in each drawer) had shown that the temperature was stabilised around 35 0 C <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawers,</b> with no cooling.

40|$|M any {{authors have}} noted that {{journals}} are biased toward publishing manuscripts with statistically signifi cant results that confi rm theory (Stanley, 2008). It is rare for a manuscript with non-signifi cant results or with results that reject well established theory to get published. This problem is often called <b>the</b> fi le <b>drawer</b> problem (Rosenthal, 1979) because authors who have insignifi cant results and/or results that confl ict with prevailing theory end up putting a paper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fi le <b>drawer</b> after multiple, perhaps unwar-ranted, rejections.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of Chinese-Magic-Box. The general idea {{is to have a}} box such that the sender can store information <b>in</b> multiple <b>drawers.</b> <b>The</b> receiver is free to open any <b>drawer.</b> However, once <b>the</b> receiver opens <b>the</b> <b>drawer,</b> he can retrieve the information from that drawer only, that is, the information that was stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other <b>drawers</b> is lost. This property is achieved by storing the information using a set of non-orthogonal quantum states. <b>The</b> different <b>drawers</b> are realized by different orthogonal set of basis for the measurement. Once the measurement is performed, <b>the</b> information <b>in</b> this basis is retrieved. At the same time, due to wave function collapse <b>the</b> information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other basis is lost and cannot be retrieved. I show how to construct a set of states for a single qubit to implement a Box with two or three drawers. Some applications are discussed. Among them is a new non-symmetric Quantum Key Distribution with only single direction classical communication. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

40|$|Human {{beings are}} endowed {{with a unique}} {{motivation}} {{to be included in}} social interactions. This natural social motivation, in turn, is thought to encourage behaviours such as flattery or self-deprecation aimed to ease interaction and to enhance the reputation of the individual who produces them. If this is the case, diminished social interest should affect reputation management. Here, we use Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) [...] primarily characterised by pervasive social disinterest [...] as a model to investigate the effect of social motivation on reputation management. Children first rated a set of pictures and were then given the opportunity to inflate their initial ratings in front of an experimenter who declared that she had drawn the picture.
