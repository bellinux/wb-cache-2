For several years in the mid-1970s, the Model 36 was issued to and carried as a duty weapon by administrative and command staff of the NC State Highway Patrol, but it was later replaced when all troopers were required to carry the then <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> weapon, the S&W Model 66 [...]357, which was in turn later replaced with the last Smith revolver, the Model 686, before the agency transitioned to semi-automatics in the early 1990s.|$|E

Up until 1994 the Border Patrol issued its Patrol Agents a [...]357 Magnum revolver as their duty sidearm, a Smith & Wesson or Ruger model large frame, six shot revolver.

The Border Patrol adopted the Beretta Model 96D, a [...]40 S&W caliber semi-automatic pistol (modified for Double-Action Only) (with 11-round capacity magazines) as its <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> sidearm in 1995.

40|$|Assumption of risk has {{presented}} courts with considerable difficulty in defining its theoretical justification {{and its relationship}} to tort duty limitations and to the defense of contributory negligence. In Minnesota and elsewhere, assumption of risk has been applied inconsistently. Sometimes it seems to relate to the <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> and sometimes it is linked to the defense of contributory negligence, but without a clear differentiation of which issue is involved. In Minnesota specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court has acknowledged that inconsistency and the difficulty in applying the concept in cases spanning several decades. This article focuses on primary assumption of risk, which is the facet of assumption of risk that has created the most difficult problems, post-Springrose. The primary problem in understanding primary assumption of risk is in determining its relationship to the <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> in tort law. A secondary and dependent problem is in determining the appropriate relationship between judge and jury for purposes of applying primary assumption of risk principles...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis {{relates to the}} negligent infliction of {{economic}} loss. In particular, it {{is concerned with the}} question of how the courts should approach the <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> in a novel economic loss case. Initially, it was intended that the thesis involve a comparative analysis of the current approaches of the English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian courts. The aim was to examine the Commonwealth courts 1 treatment of economic loss with a view to identifying the most appropriate method of dealing with novel cases. It was, however, found that not one of the approaches presented by the appellate courts in these four jurisdictions could be described as the appropriate method for determining the duty question. The search for the model approach could not be confined to English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian experiences. It was necessary to embark on a consideration of issues and concepts which were basic and fundamental to the common law. So what began as a comparative analysis also became a critical appraisal. In terms of structure, the thesis is divided into two parts. Part One presents the current approaches of the English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian courts to determining the <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> in a novel economic loss case. Using the analysis undertaken in the first part to set the context, the Part Two endeavours to present the appropriate approach. In the course of the analysis undertaken in Part One, it is seen that there are two principal areas of concern which must be addressed before a model approach can be presented. They can be summed up as follows:, (1) the question of what is the appropriate doctrinal basis for the imposition of liability for economic loss and the development of the law relating to economic loss; and (2) the question of what is the role and relevance of policy considerations in determining the <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> in an economic loss case. The conclusion reached is that liability for the negligent inf lict ion of economic loss must be imposed in accordance with a moral standard which underlies all negligence cases and the law must develop in a manner which ensures a consistent and coherent application of this standard. Accordingly, in most cases, the bounds of liability will be determined by moral or ethical considerations. The relevance of non ethical or public policy considerations as a determinant of liability is not denied. However, the circumstances in which such considerations will operate to override a determination that the plaintiff has a moral right to recover for the economic loss suffered are limited...|$|E
40|$|A trilogy {{of recent}} cases before the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia {{indicate}} {{a return to}} the celebrated statements of Lord Atkin, (himself a native of Australia) formulated some seventy years earlier, as the underlying guide in determining whether a duty of care exists in any circumstance. Whilst various approaches have emerged in the High Court over the past decade involving differing combinations of principle, policy and incremental development, none has proved satisfactory as a general determinant of duty of care in the expanding focus of negligence litigation. This article suggests that the search for a general determinant of the <b>duty</b> <b>issue,</b> has finished where it began and that the principle of neighbourhood as formulated and intended by Lord Atkin has and will continue to provide a universal yardstick as to the existence of a prima facie duty of care...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on primary {{assumption}} of risk, which is the facet of assumption of risk that has created the most difficult problems, post-Springrose. The primary problem in understanding primary assumption of risk is in determining {{its relationship to the}} <b>duty</b> <b>issue</b> in tort law. A secondary and dependent problem is in determining the appropriate relationship between judge and jury for purposes of applying primary assumption of risk principles. Part two of the article begins with a short history of some of the key Minnesota cases involving assumption of risk in the employment context. Those decisions, perhaps more than any others, indicate the complexity and inconsistent treatment of assumption of the risk in Minnesota. Part three discusses Springrose v. Willmore, the first Minnesota post-comparative negligence act case to deal with assumption of risk. Part four discusses the Minnesota Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s primary assumption of the risk cases decided after Springrose, primarily to illustrate the substantial inconsistency in the court 2 ̆ 7 s approach to primary assumption of the risk issues. Part five discusses two illuminating Minnesota Court of Appeals cases that highlight the problems that can arise when Springrose is not tightly followed. That discussion is followed by part six, which is an analysis of a recent Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that devoted a substantial amount of space in an attempt to delineate primary assumption of risk principles in Minnesota. It provides an interesting insight into the difficulty that courts have in determining the place of primary assumption of risk in Minnesota law. The seventh part of the article examines the problems involved in instructing juries on primary assumption of risk. Given Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on New Jersey law in Springrose, part eight compares Minnesota and New Jersey law, speculating on what the face of how Minnesota primary assumption of risk law would look had it followed more tightly the New Jersey Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s abolition of assumption of risk. Part nine compares Minnesota with the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability, which abolishes primary assumption of risk...|$|E
