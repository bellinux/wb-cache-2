From the proposed polynomial, the gradient of the displacement is derived and combined with that one determined by Timoshenko and Goodier to obtain the polynomial distribution of the pressure in the cross direction of wire. By using the polynomial pressure in the "stress function" proposed by Flamant, a set of equations serving to know the stresses state in the wire section is obtained. To extend the analysis to two opposite indenters, all contributions to total stress are considered, to knowing: the stresses being produced by {{each one of the}} indenters; the biaxial tension to balance the free area of pressure. Finally, by using all contributions to total stress and determining the principal stresses, the magnitude of maximum-shear-stress at each point of elastic body it could be obtained. In order to confront the model with the reality, by associating to each point its maximum-shear-stress respective, patterns of lines representing <b>isostresses</b> were obtained; such patterns were compared with a photo-elasticity image, showing a good agreement. ...|$|R

Comparatively, under <b>isostress</b> conditions both phases will feel the same stress but the strains will differ between each phase.Though composite stiffness is maximized when fibres are aligned with the loading direction, so is the possibility of fibre tensile fracture, assuming the tensile strength exceeds that of the matrix. When a fibre has some angle of misorientation θ, several fracture modes are possible. For small values of θ the stress required to initiate fracture is increased by a factor of (cos θ)−2 due to the increased cross-sectional area (A cos θ) of the fibre and reduced force (F/cos θ) experienced by the fibre, leading to a composite tensile strength of σparallel /cos2 θ where σparallel [...] is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres aligned parallel with the applied force.|$|E

Particularly in the last decades several researches have been carried out to evaluate the mechanical behavior of Ni-Ti alloys, including their tensile, torsion and fatigue properties. However, studies regarding the dependence of elastic properties on residence time of Ni-Ti wires in the oral cavity are scarce. Such approach is essential since metallic alloys are submitted to mechanical stresses during orthodontic treatment as well as pH and temperature fluctuations. The goal of the present contribution is to provide elastic stress-strain results to guide the orthodontic choice between martensitic thermal activated and austenitic superelastic Ni-Ti alloys. From {{the point of view of}} an orthodontist, the selection of appropriate materials and the correct maintenance of the orthodontic apparatus are essential needs during clinical treatment. The present work evaluated the elastic behavior of Ni-Ti alloy wires with diameters varying from 0. 014 to 0. 020 inches, submitted to hysteresis tensile tests with 8 % strain. Tensile tests were performed after periods of use of 1, 2 and 3 months in the oral cavity of patients submitted to orthodontic treatment. The results from the hysteresis tests allowed to exam the strain range covered by <b>isostress</b> lines upon loading and unloading, as well as the residual strain after unloading for both superelastic and thermal activated Ni-Ti wires.

The simulations are carried out under isothermal conditions in a specialized <b>isostress</b> ensemble in which N fluid molecules are exposed to a compressional stress acting on the fluid in directions parallel with the substrate planes. Fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are modelled as in our previous work [M. Greschek et al., Soft Matter, 2010, DOI: 10. 1039 /B 924417 D). We study several anchoring mechanisms at the solid substrate by introducing an anchoring function (0 <g(u) < 1) {{that depends on the}} orientation of a fluid molecule relative to the substrate plane; g(u) "switches" the fluid-substrate attraction on or off. Here we focus on various heterogeneous (i. e., hybrid) anchoring scenarios imposing different anchoring functions at the opposite substrates. As in our previous study we compute the <b>isostress</b> heat capacity which allows us to identify states at which the confined fluid undergoes a structural transformation. The isotropic-nematic transformation turns out to be nearly independent of the specific anchoring scenario. This is because the director in the nematic phase assumes a direction that is a compromise between the directions enforced by the competing anchoring scenarios at either substrate. On the contrary, at lower compressional stresses molecules prealign in specific directions that depend on details of the anchoring scenario...|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} {{of the stack}} of alternating crystal and amorphous layers typical of semicrystalline polyethylene is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. A previous investigation of the semicrystalline layered stack undergoing isochoric extension 1 is extended here to include several new modes of deformation: <b>isostress</b> extension, <b>isostress</b> compression, and isochoric shear, at 350 K and deformation rates of 5 × 107 and 5 × 106 s– 1. The observed stress–strain responses are interpreted {{in terms of the}} underlying structural evolution of the material for each mode of deformation. Under tensile deformation, crystallographic slip was observed at low strains (0 0. 26), melting and recrystallization were observed at the slower deformation rate, while surface melting and cavitation were observed at the faster deformation rate. Under compressive deformation at the slower deformation rate, crystallographic slip was again observed at low strains. For the faster compressive deformation, an initial period of rapid stress growth at low strain was observed. This initial stress growth then transitions to a process of fine crystallographic slip at a strain of e 3 = − 0. 005. At intermediate strains under compressive deformation, the release of bridging entanglements is observed for both strain rates. However, no melting or recrystallization phenomena were observed under compression, even at the highest strains simulated (e 3 = − 0. 33). Under shear deformation, interlamellar slip was observed for both zx and zy shear (strain gradient parallel to stacking direction). Chain segments tend to stretch and align in the shear direction. Interestingly, under shear deformation this semicrystalline polyethylene exhibits transient behavior typical of non-Newtonian fluids. Exxon Mobil Corporatio...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{directed}} toward optimizing concept designs of structures featuring inelastic material behaviours by using topology optimization. In the proposed framework, alternative structural designs are described {{with the aid of}} spatial distributions of volume fraction design variables throughout a prescribed design domain. Since two or more materials are permitted to simultaneously occupy local regions of the design domain, small-strain integration algorithms for general two-material mixtures of solids are developed for the Voigt (isostrain) and Reuss (<b>isostress)</b> assumptions, and hybrid combinations thereof. Structural topology optimization problems involving non-linear material behaviours are formulated and algorithms for incremental topology design sensitivity analysis (DSA) of energy type functionals are presented. The consistency between the structural topology design formulation and the developed sensitivity analysis algorithms is established on three small structural topology problems separately involving linear elastic materials, elastoplastic materials, and viscoelastic materials. The good performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated by solving two topology optimization problems to maximize the limit strength of elastoplastic structures.

The quality and performance of a center-wound roll are known {{to be related to the}} winding tension. In this paper, a novel optimization design method for winding tension using a special network structure is proposed. Firstly, based on the elasticity theory, the correlations between winding tension in the winding section and hoop stress distribution within a center-wound roll are analyzed. In addition, an analysis model for the residual stress due to the winding tension profile is developed. Then, according to the analysis model, the special network structure with back propagation training is developed to minimize the error of lateral residual stress, namely isostress-distribution. Finally, the experimental prototype of a roll-to-roll packaging system for glass-fiber fabric that can measure and control the winding tension is described, and actual experiments were carried out.

40|$|A new {{accelerated}} technique, {{called the}} stepped <b>isostress</b> method (SSM), is presented that allows accelerated {{testing of materials}} to determine their creep response, and in particular, their creep-rupture behaviour. The approach in SSM testing {{is similar to the}} more familiar stepped isothermal method (SIM) but the acceleration is now obtained by increasing the stress in steps rather than stepping the temperature. Additional stress provides energy to the system in an analogue of the effect of heat in SIM. This method relies on the time-stress superposition concept. Various theories, assumptions and the different steps of the method are described in detail. This method is advantageous when compared with SIM because {{there is no need to}} use elevated temperatures, which may affect the chemical properties of the tested materials. The applicability of this method is investigated. The paper presents testing on Kevlar 49 yarns using SSM. The resulting creep curves and rupture times are compared with those obtained from SIM and conventional creep testing carried out in the past. The results show good correlation between the three test methods. The ability to carry out reliable creep tests in a reasonable time at low stress levels allows a designer to have much more confidence in the data for creep-rupture behaviour for fibres and allows confident prediction of structural lifetimes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} results from conventional creep tests (CCT) and two accelerated test methods (the stepped isothermal method (SIM) and the stepped <b>isostress</b> method (SSM)) {{to determine the}} creep and creep-rupture behavior of two different aramid fibers, Kevlar 49 and Technora. CCT are regarded as the true behavior of the yarn, but they are impractical for long-term use where failures are expected only after many years. All the tests were carried out on the same batches of yarns, and using the same clamping arrangements, so the tests should be directly comparable. For both materials, SIM testing gives good agreement with CCT and gave stress-rupture lifetimes that followed the same trend. However, there was significant variation for SSM testing, especially when testing Technora fibers. The results indicate that Kevlar has a creep strain capacity that is almost independent of stress, whereas Technora shows a creep strain capacity that depends on stress. Its creep strain capacity is approximately {{two to three times}} that of Kevlar 49. The accelerated test methods give indirect estimates for the activation energy and the activation volume of the fibers. The activation energy for Technora is about 20 % higher than that for Kevlar, meaning that it is less sensitive to the effects of increasing temperature. The activation volume for both materials was similar, and in both cases, stress dependent. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|To obtain creep-rupture data at {{low level}} within a {{reasonably}} short time-scale, two accelerated techniques have been investigated. Stepped Isothermal Method (SIM) testing involves loading a single specimen, under constant load, with the temperature increased {{in a series}} of steps to accelerate the creep. Careful choice of the temperature step and step duration allow the test to be completed in about 24 hours. At each temperature step a creep curve is obtained; these are then adjusted to compensate for the different temperature levels and a creep master curve at a reference temperature is produced. In Stepped <b>Isostress</b> Method (SSM) testing, a similar approach is adopted but the acceleration is obtained by increasing the stress in steps while keeping the temperature constant. Additional stress provides energy to the system in an analogue of the effect of heat in SIM. In this thesis, SIM and SSM tests have been successfully applied to two slightly different aramid fibres, Kevlar 49 and Technora, {{for a wide range of}} loads (50 - 80 % ABL). The test data are used to determine the creep and creep-rupture behaviour of the two materials. The creep master curves obtained by accelerated testing are compared with conventional creep tests at ambient conditions, and good agreement of the data is observed. A rheological model for the prediction of the creep and creep-rupture of the two fibres is established to facilitate and greatly increase the reliability of the prediction of the long-term behaviour. This investigation allows more certainty about the creep-rupture relationships for different high modulus fibres, which will in turn allow more realistic safety factors to be applied when using these materials in engineering applications.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the effect of imperfect (not perfectly bonded) interfaces on the stiffness and strength of hierarchical polycrystalline materials. As a case study we consider a honeycomb cellular polycrystal used for drilling and cutting tools. The conclusions of the analysis are, however, general and applicable to any material with structural hierarchy. Regarding the stiffness, generalized expressions for the Voigt and Reuss estimates of the bounds to the effective elastic modulus of heterogeneous materials are derived. The generalizations regard two aspects that {{are not included in}} the standard Reuss and Voigt estimates. The first novelty consists in considering finite thickness interfaces between the constituents undergoing damage up to final debonding. The second generalization consists of interfaces not perpendicular or parallel to the loading direction, i. e., when <b>isostress</b> or isostrain conditions are not satisfied. In this case, approximate expressions for the effective elastic modulus are obtained by performing a computational homogenization approach. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the homogenized response of a representative volume element (RVE) of the honeycomb cellular polycrystalline material with one or two levels of hierarchy is numerically investigated. This is put forward by using the cohesive zone model (CZM) for finite thickness interfaces recently proposed by the authors and implemented in the finite element program FEAP. From tensile tests we find that the interface nonlinearity significantly contributes to the deformability of the material. Increasing the number of hierarchical levels, the deformability increases. The RVE is tested in two different directions and, due to different orientations of the interfaces and Mixed Mode deformation, anisotropy in stiffness and strength is observed. Stiffness anisotropy is amplified by increasing the number of hierarchical levels. Finally, the interaction between interfaces at different hierarchical levels is numerically characterized. A condition for scale separation, which corresponds to the independence of the material tensile strength from the properties of the interfaces in the second level, is established. When this condition is fulfilled, the material microstructure at the second level can be efficiently replaced by an effective homogeneous continuum with a homogenized stress–strain response. From the engineering point of view, the proposed criterion of scale separation suggests how to design the optimal microstructure of a hierarchical level to maximize the material tensile strength. An interpretation of this phenomenon according to the concept of flaw tolerance is finally presented...|$|E
40|$|Actively bent grid shells are curved {{structural}} surfaces made {{of flexible}} members. The application is mainly in roof structures. The members, spanning between two supports on the perimeter, are connected at their intersections by joints, and assembled in an initially straight grid. By lifting at {{a sufficient number}} of points the straight grid is subsequently transformed into a bent shape and new geometry is preserved by fixing the supports. Subsequently, the curved surface is braced with a third layer of flexible members. According to this specific principle of construction, actively bent grid shells can be built within a short period of time. ThinkShell, a research team at École des Ponts ParisTech, has developed a number of actively bent Glass Fiber Reinforced (GFRP) grid shells over the last ten years. Due to mechanical properties such as lightweight, high elastic limit strain, and high stiffness, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) becomes an interesting material choice for construction of long-span actively bent grid shells. In the actively bent members of the grid shells considerable amount of permanent stresses is present. The main source of stress is caused by the transformation of the straight grid into a bent shape during erection. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is sensitive to creep behavior, which may lead to possible collapse mechanism due to creep-rupture or creep-buckling as a result of reduced stiffness of the material on a long-term. Limited knowledge is available of the time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP, in the field of structural design of buildings. The main objective of this research was to define stress limits related to time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells, using the Stepped <b>Isostress</b> Method (SSM). The most important conclusion drawn from the experiments using the SSM is that, in actively bent grid shell design, it is crucially important to stay below the sustained stress limits to avoid creep-rupture, as the CFRP fails in a brittle manner. From the SSM analysis using test data from bending experiments it was concluded that if the permanent load in the CFRP is 55 % of the ultimate load, creep-rupture will happen in 40 days. This result does not seem realistic as the sustained stress limit from CUR 96 corresponds to a service life of 50 years. Out of the four steps in processing of raw test data using the SSM, the rescaling step is the most critical step. There is strong dependence between the rescaling step and the horizontal shifting step. To determine the rescaling values and horizontal shifting for the bending experiments, a corresponding conventional creep tests as a reference test is proposed. The SSM represents a promising method for accelerated creep testing and corresponding test data analysis for CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells. Sustained stress limits derived from the SSM may be used as more realistic, i. e. less conservative stress limit values to avoid creep-rupture, compared to the values defined in CUR 96, for the specific design parameters. <br/...|$|E
