The present study combines PTI and INVT reasoning and develops an entrepreneurial process view to study pre- and post-entry antecedents of technology firms' <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> familiarity. Combining PTI and INVT reasoning, we theoretically examine the role of prior <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> analysis, interaction with <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> players, and exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> particularities as antecedents of <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> familiarity.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the area of <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> entry is receiving considerable and growing academic attention over the last twenty years. In fact, the subject of international market entry is the third most researched area in international management, following the related fields of <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> investments and internationalization. The overall aim of this thesis is to explore, analyse, and understand the <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> entry and exit process that the business unit of BP Lubricants in Europe and Africa is following and identify strengths and weaknesses. A systematic literature review showed {{that there is a}} plethora of empirical evidence on <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> research that provide useful insights into this important strategic process, however, the findings are often conflicting which makes it difficult to draw conclusions that can be generalized. The review identified the main theories and constructs for <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> entry and highlighted certain gaps in the theory that the research evidence from this study has aimed to bridge.

Other findings are that a service firm has to consider certain external and internal forces in the <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> entry decision process.
