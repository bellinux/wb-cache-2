Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b> His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|In late 1922, Boyce {{departed}} {{on another}} expedition to Africa, {{this time for}} six months. Morocco {{reminded him of the}} Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> and hailed {{for the first time in}} decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>rained</b> for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>rained.</b> The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky.

The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E

5|$|Knightly Dawn {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E
5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible sensor failure which caused his team to receive misinformation.

Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> for ten more laps. Nevertheless, he stated that he trusted his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix. Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one-stop strategy.

5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b> The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited by the experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E
