40|$|Donald Trump’s inauguration as President of the United States {{has sparked}} waves of mass protests against his {{administration}} {{as well as}} the disruption of many legislators’ town hall meetings. Melissa <b>Deckman</b> draws the parallels between the current emerging Resist Trump movement and 2009 ’s Tea Party protests against President Obama.

40|$|Prior to the 2012 presidential election, Democrats {{accused the}} Republican Party of waging a ‘war on women’ over their {{opposition}} to abortion, and to the Affordable Care Act’s mandate for employers to provide birth control coverage {{as part of their}} workplace based health insurance. In new research, Melissa <b>Deckman</b> and John McTague investigate how this narrative affected the outcome of the election. They find that whilevoters’ attitudes about abortion had no direct influence on whether they voted for Mitt Romney or Obama, attitudes about the birth control mandate, however, were significantly related to voting for Obama. They also write that voters were less likely to view Republican opposition to the birth control mandate as an issue of women’s personal sexual behavior, and instead perceived it as more in tune with their attitudes towards health care and social welfare in general...|$|E
40|$|The UL 26 gene of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) encodes a 635 -amino-acid {{protease}} that cleaves itself and the HSV- 1 assembly protein ICP 35 cd (F. Liu and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 65 : 5149 - 5156, 1991). We previously examined the HSV protease by using an Escherichia coli expression system (I. C. <b>Deckman,</b> M. Hagen, and P. J. McCann III, J. Virol. 66 : 7362 - 7367, 1992) and identified two autoproteolytic cleavage sites between residues 247 and 248 and residues 610 and 611 of UL 26 (C. L. DiIanni, D. A. Drier, I. C. <b>Deckman,</b> P. J. McCann III, F. Liu, B. Roizman, R. J. Colonno, and M. G. Cordingley, J. Biol. Chem. 268 : 2048 - 2051, 1993). In this study, a series of C-terminal truncations of the UL 26 open reading frame was tested for cleavage activity in E. coli. Our results delimit the catalytic domain of the protease to the N-terminal 247 amino acids of UL 26 corresponding to No, the amino-terminal product of protease autoprocessing. Autoprocessing of the full-length protease {{was found to be}} unnecessary for catalysis, since elimination of either or both cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis fails to prevent cleavage of ICP 35 cd or an unaltered protease autoprocessing site. Catalytic activity of the 247 -amino-acid protease domain was confirmed in vitro by using a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protease was induced to high levels of expression, affinity purified, and used to cleave purified ICP 35 cd in vitro, indicating that no other proteins are required. By using a set of domain-specific antisera, all of the HSV- 1 protease cleavage products predicted from studies in E. coli were identified in HSV- 1 -infected cells. At least two protease autoprocessing products, in addition to fully processed ICP 35 cd (ICP 35 ef), were associated with intermediate B capsids in the nucleus of infected cells, suggesting a key role for proteolytic maturation of the protease and ICP 35 cd in HSV- 1 capsid assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 UL 26 open reading frame encodes a {{protease}} which cleaves a small carboxyl-terminal peptide of itself and its substrate encoded by an overlapping, 3 '-coterminal transcriptional unit, designated UL 26. 5. The translational product of UL 26. 5 is infected-cell protein 35 c,d (ICP 35 c,d) (F. Liu and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 65 : 206 - 212, 1991; F. Liu and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 65 : 5149 - 5156, 1991). The protease activity maps at the amino terminus of UL 26 translation product designated Pra. Cleavage of Pra to remove the carboxyl-terminal 25 amino acids converts the protein to Prb (F. Liu and B. Roizman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 : 2076 - 2080, 1992). Other studies reported a second, amino-terminus-proximal cleavage in UL 26 gene products made in Escherichia coli (I. C. <b>Deckman,</b> M. Hagen, and P. J. McCann III, J. Virol 66 : 7362 - 7367, 1992; C. L. DiIanni, D. A. Drier, I. C. <b>Deckman,</b> P. J. McCann III, F. Liu, B. Roizman, R. J. Colonno, and M. G. Cordingley, J. Biol. Chem., 368 : 2048 - 2051, 1993). We report the following results. (i) The amino-terminus-proximal cleavage of UL 26 protein in eukaryotic cells generates two polypeptides, an apparent M(r) - 25, 000 amino-terminal polypeptide designated Prn and a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide which corresponds in electrophoretic mobility to ICP 35 a. Cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal 25 amino acids by the UL 26 protease converted ICP 35 a to ICP 35 b. (ii) Replacement of Ala- 247 -Ser- 248 with Arg-Pro precluded the amino-terminus-proximal cleavage. (iii) Prn, the amino-terminal product of the cleavage reaction at amino acid 247 functions as a protease. (iv) Additional amino acid substitutions in the putative domain of the protease yielded results consistent with the hypothesis that UL 26 encodes a serine protease. (v) The domain of the UL 26 protein whose modification confers the formation of double bands for all products (Pra, Prb, ICP 35 a, ICP 35 b, ICP 35 c,d, and ICP 35 e,f) except Prn maps in the domain shared by UL 26 and UL 26. 5, between codons 307 and 417...|$|E
40|$|Null mutants and {{attenuated}} mutants of {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) {{have been shown to}} induce immunity against challenge from wild-type virus. Null viruses with a defect in late gene products would be expected to express more viral genes than viruses with defects in essential early gene products and thus induce a better immune response. Herpesviruses encode a late gene product (serine protease) that is autocatalytic and cleaves the capsid assembly protein during viral replication. To determine whether a virus with a mutation in this gene could induce immunity, we constructed a recombinant virus containing the gusA reporter gene in the protease domain of the HSV type 1 UL 26 open reading frame (ORF). Consistent with previous results (M. Gao, L. Matusick-Kumar, W. Hurlburt, S. F. DiTusa, W. W. Newcomb, J. C. Brown, P. J. McCann, I. <b>Deckman,</b> and R. J. Colonno, J. Virol. 68 : 3702 - 3712, 1994), recombinant virus could be isolated only from helper cell lines expressing the product of the UL 26 ORF. Mice inoculated with the recombinant virus were unaffected by doses of virus that were lethal to mice infected with wild-type virus. Mice which were previously inoculated with the recombinant virus were also protected by a subsequent challenge with wild-type virus in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that recombinant viruses lacking the protease gene are avirulent but render protection from subsequent challenge...|$|E
