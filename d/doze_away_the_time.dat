6000|$|But {{there was}} one inmate of Surbiton Cottage who saw that though Alaric spent {{so much of his}} tune with Mrs. Woodward, he found {{opportunity}} also for other private conversation; and this was Linda. Why was it that in the moments before they dressed for dinner Alaric was whispering with Gertrude, and not with her? Why was it that Alaric had felt it necessary to stay from church that Sunday evening when Gertrude also had been prevented from going by a headache? He had remained, he said, in order that Captain Cuttwater might have company; but Linda was not slow to learn that Uncle Bat had been left to <b>doze</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> by himself. Why, on the following Monday, had Gertrude been down so early, and why had Alaric been over from the inn full half an hour before his usual time? Linda saw and knew all this, and was disgusted. But even then she did not, could not think that Alaric could be untrue to her; that her own sister would rob her of her lover. It could not be that there should be such baseness in human nature! ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more there}} was nothing to do but wait patiently for the snow to cease falling and for the thaw. But how {{intolerable}} it was; for the weather continued bitterly cold for many days, and the whole country was white. During those hungry days even that poor comfort of sleeping or <b>dozing</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> was denied him, for the danger of discovery was ever present to his mind, and Shergold was not one of the callous men who had become indifferent to their fate; it was his first crime, and he loved his own life and his wife and children, crying to him for food. And the food for them was lying there on the down, close by, and he could not get it! Roast mutton, boiled mutton--mutton in a dozen delicious forms--the thought of it was as distressing, as maddening, as that of the peril he was in.|$|R
60|$|Now Rachel went on {{to where}} the three priests sat beneath their {{umbrellas}} <b>dozing</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> hours of sunlight, beckoning to the doomed family to follow her.|$|R
60|$|The thief {{was soon}} below. <b>The</b> clerk <b>dozed</b> <b>away</b> in <b>the</b> office, {{and in his}} {{stocking}} feet the man had no difficulty in passing {{out of the building}} without being noticed.|$|R
60|$|The {{song and}} the laugh rose {{frequently}} from the forecastle, where the crew were occupied with their Saturday night; and occasionally a rude {{sentiment in the}} way of a toast was heard. But weariness soon got the better of merriment forward, and the hard-worked mariners, who had the watch below, soon went down to their berths, leaving those whose duty it was to remain to <b>doze</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> long hours in such places as they could find on deck.|$|R
60|$|There {{is indeed}} one mortal {{disadvantage}} {{to which all}} preaching is subject, that those who, by the wickedness of their lives, stand in greatest need, have usually the smallest share; for either they are absent upon the account of idleness, or spleen, or hatred to religion, or in order to <b>doze</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> intemperance of the week; or, if they do come, they are sure to employ their minds rather any other way than regarding or attending {{to the business of}} the place.|$|R
60|$|I was received--not welcomed--quietly enough; not a question, not a word, {{concerning}} my long absence {{fell from}} anyone; {{it was as}} if a stranger had appeared among them, one about whom they knew nothing and consequently regarded with suspicion, if not actual hostility. I affected not to notice the change, and dipped my hand uninvited in the pot to satisfy my hunger, and smoked and <b>dozed</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> sultry hours in my hammock. Then I got my guitar and spent the rest of the day over it, tuning it, touching the strings so softly with my finger-tips that to a person four yards off the sound must have seemed like the murmur or buzz of an insect's wings; and to this scarcely audible accompaniment I murmured in an equally low tone a new song.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who comes? {{and on what}} errand?" [...] he cried, [...] "A skulker, and to burrow like a rabbit, or {{jump from}} hole to hole, like a wharf-rat!" [...] said Manual, sulkily; [...] "here have I been marching, within half musket shot of the enemy, without daring to pull a trigger even on their outposts, because our muzzles are plugged with that {{universal}} extinguisher of gunpowder, called prudence. 'Fore God ! Mr. Griffith, I hope you may never feel the temptation to do an evil deed, which I felt just now, to throw a volley of small shot into that dog-kennel of a place, if it were only to break its windows and let in the night air upon the sleeping sot, who is <b>dozing</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> fumes of some as good, old south-side--hark ye, Mr. Griffith, one word in your ear." ...|$|R
60|$|Examining {{the ropes}} carefully, they found {{some of them}} were already chafed, and, {{dragging}} out a piece of wet canvas from the lockers, they cut it into strips and lashed it round the ropes at the points where they were chafing. The strain was indeed very heavy, for the tree and the waterlogged boat rose but little with the waves, and the bow was submerged deeply every time a wave passed them, the gunwale being at no time more than a few inches out of water. Additional lashings were put on, and then Hiram and Frank returned to the cabin, and <b>the</b> latter <b>dozed</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> hours till morning, as did the negroes, Hiram remaining wide awake and watchful, and going out {{from time to time to}} look at the lashings. As soon as day broke Frank roused himself and went out; Hiram was just descending from one of the boughs.|$|R
60|$|The wise old {{mother took}} them both away when she knew I had found them, and hid {{them in a}} deeper {{solitude}} of the big woods, nearer the lake, where she could the sooner reach them from her feeding grounds. For days after the wonderful discovery I used {{to go in the}} early morning or the late afternoon, while mother deer are <b>away</b> feeding along <b>the</b> watercourses, and search the dingle {{from one end to the}} other, hoping to find the little ones again and win their confidence. But they were not there; and I took to watching instead a family of mink that lived in a den under a root, and a big owl that always slept in the same hemlock. Then, one day when a flock of partridges led me out of the wild berry bushes into a cool green island of the burned lands, I ran plump upon the deer and her fawns lying all together under a fallen treetop, <b>dozing</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> heat of the day.|$|R

60|$|I {{had many}} weary hours still to wait through. To while <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> I {{looked at my}} letters. Among them was a letter from Betteredge.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{absolute}} coordinates, if independent of all motions of matter, requires throwing <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> honored use of Galilean relativity and our notions of rigid ponderable bodies.|$|R
60|$|Left to themselves. Fred Garrison and Songbird Powell {{hardly knew}} what to do to pass <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> With all of <b>the</b> others <b>away</b> <b>the</b> spot where the {{gasoline}} launch had been tied up appeared to be unusually lonely.|$|R
60|$|I {{can never}} forget the {{eighteen}} or twenty days during which the light trade-winds were silently sweeping us towards the islands. In pursuit of the sperm whale, we had been cruising on the line some twenty degrees to the westward of the Gallipagos; and all {{that we had to}} do, when our course was determined on, was to square in the yards and keep the vessel before the breeze, and then the good ship and the steady gale did the rest between them. The man at the wheel never vexed the old lady with any superfluous steering, but comfortably adjusting his limbs at <b>the</b> tiller, would <b>doze</b> <b>away</b> by <b>the</b> hour. True to her work, the Dolly headed to her course, and like one of those characters who always do best when let alone, she jogged on her way like a veteran old sea-pacer as she was.|$|R
60|$|Thus pleasantly did Robin while <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{with his}} future shipmate until {{he arrived at}} the end of his journey, when he parted from Jim Slagg and was met by Ebenezer Smith.|$|R
6000|$|... "I, too, {{have lost}} my appetite," [...] replied Paul. [...] "But we must eat, and dinner will help pass <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I reckon {{there is no}} telling when Allen will be back." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although this [...] "spite" [...] cannot {{change the}} way the two feel about each other, It can still take <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they can spend together, which is the most enjoyable part of love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't she! My uncle's {{present to}} me to pass <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> until I can do some more soldiering. They only brought it round to me early this morning. Can I take you anywhere?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was idling <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{one morning}} {{with my friend}} the attache {{in the garden of}} the Villa Reale, when we were passed by a young man, walking alone, who {{exchanged}} bows with my friend.|$|R
60|$|Ione. Nay, my lord; I {{have come}} from her. She bid me say it was her will that I, her slave, should strive with my poor skill to while <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> till she could join thee.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} evening, so they drew their camp chairs in a circle before one of the tents and began to tell stories to amuse themselves and pass <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> before they went to bed.|$|R
6000|$|A {{great change}} came over Robin, and {{from being the}} {{foremost}} in every countryside marlock he became serious and reserved, invariably {{at the close of}} the day's work rambling away, as though anxious to shun mankind, or else spending the evening at Adam's talking over 'th' warnin'.' Strange to say, about a month afterwards he fell from a stack, and after lingering some time, during which he often deliriously rambled about the events of the dreadful night, he <b>dozed</b> <b>away,</b> Old Jemmy, <b>the</b> sexton, had another grave to open, and the grey-headed Adam was one of the bearers who carried Robin's corpse along the avenue in which they had so short a <b>time</b> before seen <b>the</b> fairy funeral.{10} ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, thank you,' {{said the}} shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; 'you can't guess how happy {{you have made}} me,' and he swam <b>away</b> into <b>the</b> shadow, hoping to sleep <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> till <b>the</b> monkey came again.|$|R
5000|$|Minor story-lines often involve Scottish Privates Kevin [...] "Mac" [...] McDowell and Euan [...] "Rocket" [...] Armstrong, and {{the bizarre}} {{activities}} they invent to while <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> described by another character as [...] "Stupid, dangerous and often quite unhygienic".|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile her comradeship {{was sweet}} to John Dutcher. He hardly knew his {{loss of a}} son so {{completely}} was he companioned by Rose. He had put far <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when she should wear shoes and long dresses and become a [...] "young lady." ...|$|R
60|$|Inaction, {{during the}} {{development}} of some critical manoeuvre, while awaiting the signal to be up and doing, is hard to bear. Arkal and his men whiled <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in whispered conversations, which related more or less to the part {{they were expected to}} play.|$|R
6000|$|Byron spent Sunday, April 25, 1816, at Dover.

6000|$|He is {{the true}} house-band, and centre of the company--of greater {{fellowship}} and practical social talent than any.

6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Ruby. [...] "Come, Bremner, I {{have heard}} {{you say that you}} had read all about that business. Let's hear the story; it will help to while <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> for there's no chance of anyone gettin' to sleep with such a row outside." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would appear}} as {{if there had been}} a waste of {{material}} in making such a large high nest, when only two or three moderate-sized eggs are placed in the slight depression at the top; but, when we consider that the flamingo uses this tall affair as a seat, as well as a nest, we can easily understand that flamingoes, like most other birds, understand how to adapt their nests to their own convenience and peculiarities. Sitting astraddle on one of these tall nests, which look something like peach-baskets turned upside down, with her head stuck as far under her wing as she can get it, <b>the</b> flamingo <b>dozes</b> <b>away,</b> during <b>the</b> long sultry hours of day, as comfortably and happily as if she was a little wren snugly curled up inside of its cosey nest. It is not mere situation which makes us happy. Some people enjoy life in cottages, others in palaces, and some birds sit in a pile of hard sticks and think themselves quite as cosey as those which repose upon the softest down.|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: Two {{dogs and}} umbrella] We {{went downstairs to}} breakfast.

'"There {{is little}} need," [...] said the monk, with a meaning look, [...] "to fritter <b>away</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in gewgaws which shall raise up the pale ghosts of hopes of early years.
