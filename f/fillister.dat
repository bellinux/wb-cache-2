50|$|Shan Shitu was {{the general}} {{guarding}} the Linyang Pass. He was called the General with Four Treasures, because he had four unique treasures {{that no one else}} had: the Tilu Spear, the Horse of Hulei-Bao, the Yeming Helmet and the Fish Scale Armour. The Tilu Spear was a long spear with a <b>fillister</b> near the spearpoint. When enemies were hit by the Tilu Spear, their blood would come out quickly through the <b>fillister</b> which might lead them to die. The neighing of the Hulei-Bao would scare enemy’s horses during the battle. The Yeming Helmet was made with luminous material which would benefit Shang Shitu during battles at night. The Fish Scale Armour was so hard and tight that normal swards and spears could not cut through it. Shang Shitu took part in several large-scaled battles. When Wagang Fort’s forces expanded to Linyang Pass, he united with Xin Wenli’s force to fight against Wagang Fort troops. He always had ambivalence. He was aware that what Wagang Fort did was good for common people, but he knew that he could never join Wagang Fort because he swore that he would never betray his country. At last, he chose to commit suicide, because by doing so he would neither betray the Sui Dynasty nor stop Wagang Fort from doing right things. Before his death, he gave the Tilu Spear and the Hulei-Bao to Qin Shubao as gifts.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{heat transfer}} and fluid dynamics in a forced convection laminar flow in a channel with parallel <b>fillisters.</b> The problem is solved by the point-matching method. The {{influence of the}} height and width of the <b>fillisters</b> on the thermal-fluid characteristics of a channel flow is discussed in the present research. The local dimensionless velocity, f Re values, local dimensionless temperature and mean Nusselt number of the fluid flow are all obtained for a channel flow under the influence of parallel <b>fillisters...</b>|$|R
50|$|The barbettes are {{gathered}} up {{on both sides}} facing the sea. The biggest cannon is installed in the north-west. The barbette has a circular cannon shot rack with full 360-degree rotation. The firing angle covers the entire Tamsui River estuary. The sub-wall near the muzzle is in concave arc shape in response to trajectory clearance. There are four modern breechloaders mounted on the barbette. The main barbette is set up with one 12-inch Armstrong breechloader and one 8-inch Krupp breechloader. The secondary barbette is set up with one 10-inch Armstrong breechloader and one 8-inch Krupp breechloader. The sub-wall next to the barbette has a row of shell-shaped <b>fillisters</b> used for shell stockpiles.|$|R
