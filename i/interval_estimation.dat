25|$|In the southeastern, central, and southwestern {{part of the}} United States, {{the adult}} C. rufifacies {{is one of the}} first insects to arrive on a fresh corpse. The adults {{normally}} arrive within the first 10 minutes after death. The larvae also have a shorter developmental time than other species, but because of their predatory nature, they can also alter entomological-based post mortem <b>interval</b> <b>estimation.</b> In Texas and Florida, the species emerges from corpses that are in an advanced stage of decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} is being conducted on Cynomya cadaverina {{to gain more}} information on its lifecycle {{as well as its}} behavior in order to better pinpoint time of death with postmortem <b>interval</b> <b>estimation.</b> This information will further aid forensic entomologists as well as investigators in solving medicocriminal investigations. Also, continued research on mitochondrial DNA analysis will be able to provide more identifications in cases where identification may have seemed impossible. Although Cynomya cadaverina is not as forensically or medically important as some of the other species of fly, it can still be a powerful tool in investigations as well as aid in maggot therapy.|$|E
25|$|To {{estimate}} insect age, forensic entomologists {{must determine}} {{the amount of}} time a particular insect spends in each stage of development and apply this information to temperature data at a crime scene to determine a post-mortem <b>interval</b> <b>estimation.</b> Timing of various insect stages is determined in a laboratory at standardized temperatures so that ranges may be applied to the different temperature conditions encountered in the field. Post-mortem intervals are estimated by determining the accumulated degree days (ADD) or accumulated degree hours (ADH) acquired by each insect stage on the remains; this information is then used to calculate the overall degree days or degree hours accumulated during the insectâ€™s entire life cycle and association with the carcass, representing the minimal amount of time the body has been available for colonization by insects. This estimation does not claim to represent an accurate time of death, but rather a minimal time of colonization. This is an important distinction that must be considered with the use of forensic evidence in courts of law.|$|E
40|$|Linear {{polarization}} measurements {{provide access}} to two quantities, the degree (DOP) and the angle of polarization (AOP). The aim of this work is to give a complete and concise overview of how to analyze polarimetric measurements. We review <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> for the DOP with a frequentist and a Bayesian approach. Point estimations for the DOP and <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> for the AOP are further investigated with a Bayesian approach to match observational needs. Point and <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> are calculated numerically for frequentist and Bayesian statistics. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to clarify {{the meaning of the}} calculations. Under observational conditions, the true DOP and AOP are unknown, so that classical statistical considerations - based on true values - are not directly usable. In contrast, Bayesian statistics handles unknown true values very well and produces point and <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> for DOP and AOP, directly. Using a Bayesian approach, we show how to choose DOP point estimations based on the measured signal-to-noise ratio. <b>Interval</b> <b>estimations</b> for the DOP show great differences in the limit of low signal-to-noise ratios between the classical and Bayesian approach. AOP <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> that are based on observational data are presented for the first time. All results are directly usable via plots and parametric fits.

Authors {{extend the}} multi-parameter attacktree model to include {{inaccurate}} or estimated parameter values, which are modelled as probabilistic <b>interval</b> <b>estimations.</b> The paper develops mathematical tools {{to extend the}} computation rules of the attacktree model to work with <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> instead of point estimates.

50|$|In statistics, <b>interval</b> <b>estimation</b> {{is the use}} {{of sample}} data to {{calculate}} an interval of possible (or probable) values of an unknown population parameter, in contrast to point estimation, which is a single number. Jerzy Neyman (1937) identified <b>interval</b> <b>estimation</b> ("estimation by interval") as distinct from point estimation ("estimation by unique estimate"). In doing so, he recognised that then-recent work quoting results {{in the form of an}} estimate plus-or-minus a standard deviation indicated that <b>interval</b> <b>estimation</b> was actually the problem statisticians really had in mind.|$|E

50|$|Confidence {{intervals}} are {{one method}} of <b>interval</b> <b>estimation,</b> {{and the most}} widely used in frequentist statistics.An analogous concept in Bayesian statistics is credible intervals, while an alternative frequentist method is that of prediction intervals which, rather than estimating parameters, estimate the outcome of future samples. For other approaches to expressing uncertainty using intervals, see <b>interval</b> <b>estimation.</b>|$|E

We compare the classical estimators {{based on their}} mean squared errors (MSE's). Then, we obtain classical estimators of the shape parameter of this distribution under grouped data.

25|$|As {{members of}} Sarcophaga bullata are found {{from coast to}} coast in the United States and in parts of Canada, these flesh flies have been the focus of many forensically related studies. Most of these studies deal with the {{immature}} stages, as maggots are a helpful tool in the forensic world for determining post-mortem <b>interval</b> <b>estimations.</b> One such study concerning S. bullata determined that when evaluating a post-mortem interval, temperature {{plays a major role in}} maturation of the maggots and the decomposition of the surrounding tissue. This is an important consideration for forensic entomologists, as the ambient temperature at the crime scene before and during the colonization of human remains by arthropods must be accounted for to ensure that post-mortem <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> are accurate.|$|R
30|$|The {{important}} {{fact from}} {{a view of}} the calcium score is a confidence interval of the median for the individual analyzed groups of patients. In this context it is important, so that these <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> would correspond with estimated range of values proposed by physicians from clinical practice. The individual <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> lay inside of expected intervals of the CS. Interesting fact is a comparison of individual interval lengths. Calcified blood vessels have the narrowest interval of calcium score. The next important fact is also comparison between length of the estimated intervals and the average value estimation. These parameters are directly proportional. Gastwirth median exhibits minimal differences in a comparison with the median estimation. In a case of the CBV group, the Gastwirth median is identical to median estimation; in the other cases, observed differences are not perceived as statistically significant.|$|R

40|$|Discrete event {{simulation}} modelling {{has been}} extensively used in modelling complex systems. Although it offers great conceptual-modelling flexibility, it is both computationally expensive and data intensive. There are several examples of simulation models that generate millions of observations to achieve satisfactory point and confidence <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> for the model variables. In these cases, it is exceptionally cumbersome to conduct the required output and sensitivity analysis in a spreadsheet or statistical package. In this paper, we highlight the advantages of employing data warehousing techniques for storing and analyzing simulation output data. The proposed data warehouse environment is capable of providing the means for automating the necessary algorithms and procedures for estimating different parameters of the simulation. These include initial transient in steady-state simulations and point and confidence <b>interval</b> <b>estimations.</b> Previously developed models for evaluating patient flow through hospital departments are used to demonstrate the problem and the proposed solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is finding {{classical}} and Bayesian estimators for the shape parameter of the Kumaraswamy distribution using un-grouped data and also considers relationship between them. We show how the classical estimators can be derived from various choices made within a Bayesian framework. We compare the classical estimators based on their Mean Squared Errors (MSE's). Then, we obtain Bayesian and non-Bayesian estimators of the shape parameter of this distribution under Grouped data. In Bayesian estimation, we consider three types of loss functions; the Squared error, Precautionary and General entropy loss functions which are symmetric and asymmetric, respectively. In all cases, we considered both point and <b>interval</b> <b>estimations.</b> These the point and <b>interval</b> <b>estimations</b> are compared empirically using Monte-Carlo simulation. Bayes approach under Precautionary loss function is best estimator for estimating the parameter of Kumaraswamy distribution and this is true for both un-grouped and grouped data...|$|R

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis {{is the introduction}} of Bayesian quantile regression for hidden Markov models, especially {{when we have to}} deal with extreme quantile regression analysis, as there is a limited research to inference conditional quantiles for hidden Markov models, under a Bayesian approach. The first objective is to compare Bayesian extreme quantile regression and the classical extreme quantile regression, with the help of simulated data generated by three specific models, which only differ in the error termâ€™s distribution. It is also investigated if and how the error termâ€™s distribution affects Bayesian extreme quantile regression, in terms of parameter and confidence <b>intervals</b> <b>estimation.</b> Bayesian extreme quantile regression is performed by implementing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to update our parameters, while the classical extreme quantile regression is performed by using linear programming. Moreover, the same analysis and comparison is performed on a real data set. The results provide strong evidence that our method can be improved, by combining MCMC algorithms and linear programming, in order to obtain better parameter and confidence <b>intervals</b> <b>estimation.</b> After improving our method for Bayesian extreme quantile regression, we extend it by includin...|$|R
