We have not come together merely to talk again, but to make decisions, and I implore competent agencies to take all measures for the elimination of the Jew from the German economy, and to submit them to me.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} accepted most {{of these}} recommendations, but also kept {{the status quo in}} Somerset ("after taking account of the number and strength of the representations which I received opposing the recommendations"), and in North Yorkshire retained a rump two-tier North Yorkshire without York ("in the light of the strong representations which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> opposing the Commission's recommendations for North and West Riding")– both reportedly the subject of strong lobbying by local Conservative MPs. The government did not accept the recommendations of the Commission on Gloucestershire, and announced its intention to refer the county back. These changes were implemented in 1996.|$|E

500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, the Viceroy held any {{prospect of}} a 'salt protest' in disdain. After he ignored the letter and refused to meet with Gandhi, the march was set in motion. Gandhi remarked, [...] "On bended knees I asked for bread and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> stone instead." [...] The eve of the march brought thousands of Indians to Sabarmati to hear Gandhi speak at the regular evening prayer. An American academic writing for The Nation reported that [...] "60,000 persons gathered {{on the bank of}} the river to hear Gandhi's call to arms.

500|$|While {{playing in}} a sold-out {{friendly}} match against Canada at BMO Field in Toronto, Ontario in June 2013, Leroux was booed by Canadian fans throughout the match. After scoring during stoppage time to bring the score to 3–0 {{in favor of the}} U.S., Leroux celebrated her goal by hushing the crowd and pointing to the U.S. emblem on her jersey which further inflamed many fans in the crowd. After the game, she stated via Twitter, [...] "When you chant racial slurs, taunt me and talk about my family don't be mad when I shush you and show pride in what I represent. #america." [...] The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that Leroux had [...] "endured abuse both verbally and in social media" [...] since switching to the U.S. national soccer team in 2008; however, Leroux later clarified that no such incidents took place at BMO Field. [...] "My tweet from this morning wasn't in response to anything from yesterday's match at BMO Field. In fact, the atmosphere at the stadium was a positive step forward for women's soccer. Unfortunately, the type of abuse <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> in the past and via social media for my decision to play for the United States is a step backwards. That is what prompted my response {{in the heat of the}} moment." ...|$|E

The Bogdanovs then attributed the quoted passages to Freidel, who said, [...] "I'm very upset about that because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> e-mail from {{people in the community}} asking me why I've defended the Bogdanov brothers.

2500|$|Conservative Judaism {{has largely}} ignored this {{practice}} in the past, but recently has begun to reevaluate its silence {{in this area and}} to consider the spiritual implications of mikvah immersion for human sexuality and for women. Jews-by-choice tend to recall the mikvah ceremony as an experience of heightened spirituality, leaving a permanent mark on their religious awareness. Some comments <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> about the mikvah include: [...] "It made me feel closer to God"; [...] "An emotional highlight of my life"; [...] "When I came up from the waters all was quiet, my eyes wanted to cry. My soul was still...I am still in a state of peacefulness and love fills me"...These observations, written by converts to Judaism several weeks after the event, reflect the powerful impact of the mikvah ritual on Jews-by-choice and the profound importance they attach to its spiritual significance.|$|E

[...] The Investor's Business Daily editorialists had to beat a retreat and quickly retracted its claim after {{it was pointed out}} that Hawking is in fact British, and has lived his entire life in the United Kingdom with treatment from the NHS. Stephen Hawking responded, [...] "I wouldn’t be here today {{if it were not for}} the NHS. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived." ...|$|E
