Economic theory suggests {{that the impact of}} {{exchange rate}}s should vary with the degree of exposure to internacional competition and with the technology level. This paper contributes by bringing together these two views, both theoretically and empirically. We show the both the degree of openness and the technology level mediate the impact of exchange rate movements on labour market developments. According to our estimations, whereas employment in high-technology sectors seems to be relatively immune to changes in real exchange rates, these appear to have sizable and significant effects on highly open low-technology sectors. The analysis of job flows suggests that the impact of exchange rates on these sectors occurs through <b>employment</b> <b>destruction.</b> exchange rates; international trade; <b>employment</b> <b>destruction.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{dynamics}} of Spanish {{unemployment in the}} last thirty years has been characterized by a high and persistent unemployment period (from 1982 to 1999) and by two transition periods, one of massive <b>employment</b> <b>destruction</b> (from 1972 to 1982) and one of massive employment creation (from 1999 to 2007). After that, unemployment has raised again. This behavior is well captured by a non-linear smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) model and our analysis indicates the existence of two regimes with a fast transition between them: a high regime with an equilibrium value of unemployment of 18. 3 % and a low regime with a equilibrium value of 7. 6 %.

The empirical analysis is restricted to men and is based on matched employer-employee microdata and the decomposition techniques of Juhn et al. (1991, 1993) and Fortin et al. (2011). Our results show that the significant native-immigrant wage gap that exists both in terms of average wages and of differentials along the wage distribution is essentially explained by differences in the endowments of observed characteristics so that, in general, immigrants tend to receive a similar wage treatment than Spaniards with analogous observed attributes. On the other hand, the Great Recession has had a noticeable impact on the relative wages of immigrants, given that the significant increase of the native-immigrant wage gap observed during the previous expansionary period was mitigated during the economic downturn due to composition effects arising from the severe <b>employment</b> <b>destruction</b> pattern...|$|E
40|$|Integration {{into the}} world economy, {{specialization}} in low-technology sectors and labour market rigidity have been singled out as structural features of the Portuguese economy that are crucial for the understanding of its performance. In this paper, we explore empirically the role of openness, technology and labour market rigidity in {{the determination of the}} effect of the exchange rate on the dynamics of employment in Portugal. Our estimates indicate that employment in low-technology sectors {{with a high degree of}} trade openness and facing less rigidity in the labour market is more sensitive to movements in exchange rates. Therefore, our results provide additional evidence on the relevance of those structural features for explaining the evolution of the Portuguese economy in the last decades. In this paper the degree of labour market rigidity is measured at the sector level by means of a novel index. According to this index, high-technology sectors face less labour market rigidity. These sectors are also more exposed to international competition. However, the bulk of <b>employment</b> <b>destruction</b> has occurred in low-technology sectors.

Such intervention often results in wage compression and restrictions on how firms use their workers. This paper investigates the impact of such interventions on the labor market conditions faced by low-skill workers in Mauritius. It finds that even relatively minor intervention can dramatically increase the fragility of jobs, the length of unemployment spells, as well as the extent of unemployment and labor market churning.

30|$|In {{the case}} of skilled workers with {{temporary}} contracts (see Fig.  5 b), the highest own-price elasticity corresponds to Manizales (−[*] 1.061). For permanent unskilled workers (see Fig.  5 c), the greatest value is found in Pereira (−[*] 1.843) and the least in Barranquilla (−[*] 0.983). In {{the case of}} unskilled temporary workers (see Fig.  5 d), the elasticity varies between −[*] 0.27 (Bogotá) and −[*] 0.58 (Barranquilla), and only these two cities, together with Medellín and Pereira, hold significant long-run elasticities. Consistent with Fig.  5, the geographic breakdown confirms that demand for temporary workers, both skilled and unskilled, is less responsive to its own price than permanent ones. To achieve better outcomes, all agents involved in the labour market should consider this heterogeneity. For example, if, ceteris paribus, there is a shock that increases real wages in Pereira, 31 given the sizable elasticity for unskilled workers, there will be <b>employment</b> <b>destruction.</b> By contrast, if the shock reduces the real wage, employment will rise. However, high volatility in the labour market is not desirable. Instead, to avoid adverse employment outcomes after the shocks, wages should be more flexible in that city. 32 Alternatively, the cost of permanent unskilled labour should be lowered to have a response {{similar to that of}} temporary labour, for which the elasticity is −[*] 0.44. In other words, the duality of the labour market should be reduced. However, this policy prescription is not necessarily the same if we observe the unskilled temporary workers in Bogotá where the response of labour demand is much smaller and the shock can be absorbed without a high risk of job destruction.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{and impact of}} North-North and North-South trade {{have been among the}} main areas of research in the literature of international trade. But how trade shocks emanating from a low-wage southern country affect the manufacturing sector of other low-wage countries has been little researched. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} evidence on firm-level adjustment to low-wage trade shock in a low-wage developing country context. The main objective of the thesis is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining the impact of import competition shock from China on the evolution of manufacturing sector in India. This thesis combines plant level data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) 1998 - 2009 with the product level trade data from UN Comtrade database. The thesis contains two main chapters –chapter 2, which explores the impact of a sharp rise in Chinese import exposure on overall plant performance and product reallocation dynamics within-plant, and chapter 3. The latter dwells on wage inequality and employment within-plant. Chapter 2 finds that increased import competition from China following its WTO accession leads to improvements in revenue productivity and a reduction of product scope at the plant-level. A 10 percentage point increase in Chinese import exposure leads to a 3. 7 percent increase in large plants’ total-factor productivity. The same amount of increase in exposure to Chinese imports leads to a one percent decrease in the number of products produced by the plant. Plant product-level analysis suggests that the impact on selection of products is not symmetric. Plants drop the product in which Chinese import exposure is higher; however, the closer the product is to the core competence of the plant, the less likely it is to be dropped. Although import competition from high-wage countries has no statistically significant impact on plant performance or product scope, plant product-level adjustment shows that import competition shocks from both high-wage countries and China have a similar impact on the selection of products within a plant. Chapter 3 finds that the rise in import competition from China leads to a general increase in within-plant wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers in large plants. But the overall pattern is driven by much greater adjustment in flexible labor markets or states that have employer friendly industrial relation regulation, while no significant adjustment is evident in the inflexible market. I find that a 10 percentage point increase in Chinese import exposure leads to a 1. 35 percent increase in skill premium in the sample of large plants, whereas the same change leads to a 2. 65 percent increase in skill premium in the flexible market. It is also observed that increase in import competition from China causes a downsizing of low-productivity plants through <b>employment</b> <b>destruction,</b> and an expansion of high-productivity plants via employment creation. Again, the reallocation of employment is only evident in the flexible labor market...|$|E

The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of <b>employment</b> or <b>destruction</b> of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment.

40|$|Despite the {{relevance}} {{in terms of}} policy, we still know little in Spain about where and by whom jobs are created, and how that is affecting the size distribution of firms. The main innovation {{of this paper is}} to use a rich database that overcomes the problems encountered by other firm-level studies to shed some light on the employment generation of small firms in Spain. We find that small firms contribute to employment disproportionately across all sectors of the economy although the difference between their employment and job creation share is largest in the manufacturing sector. The job creators in that sector are both new and established firms whereas only new small firms outperform their larger counterparts in the service sector. The large annual job creation of the small firm size class is shifting the firm size distribution towards the very small production units, although not uniformly across industries of different technology intensity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical relation between employment protection regulation and gross job flows {{in a sample}} of developed and developing countries. By implementing a difference in difference test we avoid the potentially severe endogeneity and omitted variable problems associated with cross-country regressions. This test is based on the hypothesis that job security regulations are more binding in some sectors of economic activity than in others depending on sector-specific characteristics such as product demand volatility or factor specificity. Unlike most of the existing literature, our analysis indicates that more stringent job security regulations slow down job reallocation. This is more so in sectors that require higher labor flexibility. These effects occur within the sample of developed and developing countries and are large in magnitude. Moreover, they are robust to changes in regulatory measures, measurement of sector flexibility requirements, control variables and samples. In contrast, regulations on firm entry and exit seem to play a limited role in reducing job flowEmployment Protection policies, Job Creation, Job <b>Destruction,</b> <b>Employment</b> flows and Firm entry and Exit. ...|$|R

The model is utilized to analyze the impact of different shocks {{on a set of}} variables under two alternative monetary policy rules. The main characteristic of the labor market is the existence of a search friction that results in a positive equilibrium rate of unemployment. Sticky prices, on the other hand, introduce a demand sided transmission mechanism for the monetary policy that allows to analyze the effects of alternative policies on the economy. The model is able to generate a positive correlation between inflation and employment (the Phillips curve) as well as the observed correlation pattern between job creation and <b>employment</b> and job <b>destruction</b> and <b>employment.</b> The results also indicate that a policy rule that only targets inflation (strict inflation targeting) produce a larger and more persistent response of unemployment as well as more volatile rates of job creation and job destruction.

We track 3, 200 target firms and their 150, 000 establishments {{before and after}} acquisition, comparing outcomes to controls similar in terms of industry, size, age, and prior growth. Relative to controls, employment at target establishments declines 3 percent over two years post buyout and 6 percent over five years. The job losses are concentrated among public-to-private buyouts, and transactions involving firms in the service and retail sectors. But target firms also create more new jobs at new establishments, and they acquire and divest establishments more rapidly. When we consider these additional adjustment margins, net relative job losses at target firms are less than 1 percent of initial employment. In contrast, the sum of gross job creation and destruction at target firms exceeds that of controls by 13 percent of employment over two years. In short, private equity buyouts catalyze the creative destruction process in the labor market, with only a modest net impact on <b>employment.</b> The creative <b>destruction</b> response mainly involves a more rapid reallocation of jobs across establishments within target firms. ...|$|R

Qualitative analytical results show that wage and employment subsidies increase employment, especially of low skill workers, and also increase wages. A job creation or hiring subsidy reduces unemployment duration but increases incidence with an ambiguous effect on overall employment. A firing tax has the reverse effects but the same indeterminacy. In the special case of a competitive search equilibrium, in which search externalities are internalized, there is a first best configuration. The results are: no tax on the wage, an employment subsidy that offsets the distortions on the job destruction margin induced by unemployment compensation and employment protection policy, {{as well as a}} hiring subsidy equal to the implicit tax on severance imposed by any form of employment protection.

In this environment, policymakers face the related challenges of addressing unemployment pressures while striking a balance between maintaining a liberal foreign labor policy and a reasonable level of competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Using a matching function framework, this paper examines labor market policies that are likely to expand the ability to hire nationals in the non-oil sector. It finds that an effective labor strategy should focus on strengthening investment in human capital, adopting institutional reforms, and promoting a vibrant non-oil economy.

Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that would be declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute. The most famous examples of McCarthyism include the speeches, investigations, and hearings of Senator McCarthy himself; the Hollywood blacklist, associated with hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC); and the various anti-communist activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under Director J. Edgar Hoover. It is difficult to estimate the number of victims of McCarthyism. The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs. In many cases simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees did in fact have a past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party USA. But for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. The African American intellectual and activist W. E. B. Du Bois was affected by these policies and he became incensed in 1961 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 1950 McCarran Act, a key piece of McCarthyism legislation which required communists to register with the government. To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the Communist party in October 1961, at the age of 93. Around that time, he wrote: [...] "I believe in communism. I mean by communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part." [...] In 1950 Du Bois had already run for U.S. Senator from New York on the socialist American Labor Party ticket and received about 200,000 votes, or 4% of the statewide total.|$|R

They use their findings to make practical recommendations about relocating Bugis farmers and fishers from East Kalimantan's Kutai National Park and to assess relocation {{as an alternative to}} maintaining the status quo with respect to settlements within the Park's lowland rainforest. In addition, their findings are used to challenge some widely held generalisations about the impoverished condition of forest settlers, the preferability of land to only cash to those who might be resettled, and the inter-relations between urban/industrial <b>employment</b> and forest <b>destruction.</b> The report is methodologically interesting as well. It shows how data collection and analysis may be guided by the goal of obtaining causal histories of events (including such events as forest-clearing in particular places at particular times and past changes in work and residence by settlers in the National Park). It shows how data collection and analysis, thus guided, may lead to significant research findings not obtained by investigators using rapid appraisal and standard survey methods and pre-set questionnaires.

Using a search-matching model, {{we argue that}} this type of partial reform is inefficient: easing restrictions on temporary jobs fosters both job creation and job destruction, but strict EPL discourages both. The overall impact on equilibrium unemployment is thus ambiguous, depending on the characteristics of the specific labor market. Simulations of the model, calibrated for the French labor market, suggest that the job destruction effect is stronger, thus raising the unemployment rate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} the pattern by which firms are born, grow, contract, and die, and of their influence on <b>employment</b> creation and <b>destruction.</b> The behaviour of firms in both the USA and UK is discussed. The problems of stimulating new firm formation, {{and the expansion of}} appropriate small firms is discussed. The results have policy implications for European policy makers. A number of studies are described which have all attempted to measure the birth and death rates of firms, and their expansion or contraction, by tracking the actual change of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions of individual firms over a given time period, using very large computer databases. Researchers have found that the results point towards a system in which some regions declined not because of higher than average failure rates, but because they were not sharing in the growth. In one major UK study, small firms performed very well, providing 31 % of all new jobs, over the 1971 - 81 period although consisting of only 13 % of all employment. Firms employing 20 to 99 also performed well. Those in the 100 to 999 employee range only produced about the same proportion of jobs as their employment, and the largest firms, with more than 1000 employees, performed very badly. There were similarities of pattern between {{the results of this study}} and that of work in the USA, but the overwhelming USA result that most jobs stem from small firms, is not so loud in the UK, although they were a very important contributor. There is a danger of misinterpreting these highly simplified results, because we do not yet understand the complex symbiotic relationship which exists between large, medium and small firms. In the UK study job creation was heavily biassed towards the small firms. It is expansions which are creating the new jobs in the economy rather than births, and in particular, expansions from the small cohorts. It suggests that we should consider much more seriously how we can encourage and help small firms to grow. Small firm growth rather than birth appears to be a (if not the) major factor in job creation. The question of how we can stimulate expansion is examined. The relative roles of manufacturing or services are discussed and trends in the USA is used as one possible indicator of likely sectoral developments in Europe. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} observation that small firms {{have created the}} majority of new jobs during the 1980 s has had a tremendous influence on public policy. Governmentshave looked to the small firm sector for employment growth, and have promoted policies to augment this expansion. However, recent research in the US suggeststhat net job creation in the small firm sector may have been overestimated, relative to that in large firms. The {{first part of this}} paper addresses various measurement issues raised in the recent research, and uses a very unique Canadian longitudinal data set thatencompasses all companies in the Canadian economy to reassess the issue of job creation by firm size. We conclude that over the 1978 - 92 period, for both theentire Canadian economy and the manufacturing sector, the growth rate of net and gross employment decreases monotonically as the size of firm increases, no matterwhich method of sizing firms is used. Measurement does matter, however, as the magnitude of the difference in the growth rates of small and large firms is verysensitive to the measurement approaches used. Part one of the paper also produces results for various industrial sectors, and examines employment growth inexisting small and large firms (i. e., excluding births). It is found that employment growth in the population of existing small and large firms is very similar. Finallyattempts are made to introduce a job quality aspect to the numbers by using payroll distributions rather than employment. The net and gross rates of increase anddecrease in payrolls by firm size are found to be only marginally different than those of employment. The second part of the paper looks at concentration of <b>employment</b> creation and <b>destruction</b> within size classes. This is relevant because if growth is highlyconcentrated, knowing that a firm is small will provide little information about its prospects for growth. Most small firms would grow relatively little, or decline, whilea few expanded a lot. It is found that both job creation and destruction is highly concentrated among relatively few firms in all size groups, but it is greater amongsmall and mid-sized companies than large. Finally attempts are made to correlate the performance of businesses over two three-year periods. It is found thatknowing that a firm is a high performer (in terms of jobs created) over one period is of only limited value in determining growth in the second period. This isparticularly true among small firms. These results suggest that firms which expand rapidly during one period are replaced to some considerable degree by others inthe subsequent period.
