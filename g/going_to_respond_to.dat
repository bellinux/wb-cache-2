500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, after George Zimmerman's {{acquittal}} for {{the shooting death of}} Trayvon Martin, the movement began with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. The movement was co-founded by three black community organizers: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. Garza, Cullors and Tometi met through [...] "Black Organizing for Leadership & Dignity" [...] (BOLD), a national organization that trains community organizers. They began to question how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> what they saw as the devaluation of black lives after Zimmerman's acquittal. Garza wrote a Facebook post titled [...] "A Love Note to Black People" [...] in which she said: [...] "Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter". Cullors replied: [...] "#BlackLivesMatter". Tometi then added her support, and Black Lives Matter was born as an online campaign.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go.

[...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E
5000|$|On August 28, 2001, U.S. {{aviation}} {{officials said}} that Morales had been hired by Blackhawk International Airways just {{two days before the}} crash, and was not authorized by the FAA to fly the aircraft for the operator. FAA records showed that Blackhawk International Airways was clear to fly aircraft under a single-pilot certificate. However, according to Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the FAA in Atlanta, Morales was not on the name authorization papers. Bergen did not identify the pilot who was on the papers, since [...] "it would not be appropriate" [...] to release it, but confirmed Morales was not qualified to fly the Cessna. Morales's father addressed his son's death and responsibility in the crash. [...] "Luis was responsible for nine lives - eight plus his own. Someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> for those eight lives. And someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> for his life <b>to</b> me."

The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> rashly <b>to</b> customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release.

This production, the first outside of the UK, featured brand new direction and design by an Australian creative team, including director Simon Phillips. Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne were cast as the leads. Before the show's opening, Phillips addressed the negative reaction of fans of Phantom to the London production, stating: [...] "I think {{the majority of the}} noise about Love Never Dies wasn't literary. They didn't care that Andrew was creating a sequel to the original story." [...] However, Love Never Dies is not a sequel to Gaston Leroux's original novel, in which the character of the Phantom dies at the end. Phillips additionally addressed the audience's suspension of disbelief with regard to the plot of Love Never Dies: [...] "The central plot idea is that the Phantom and Christine have slept together. If people don't buy that, then they're never going to come onboard with the show, they're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|The toasts now {{began in}} the {{customary}} order, attended with speeches neither more nor less witty and ingenious than the specimens of table-eloquence which had heretofore delighted me. As preparatory to each new display, the herald, or whatever he was, behind the chair of state, gave awful notice that the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor was about to propose a toast. His Lordship being happily delivered thereof, together with some accompanying remarks, the band played an appropriate tune, and the herald again issued proclamation {{to the effect that}} such or such a nobleman, or gentleman, general, dignified clergyman, or what not, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor's toast; then, if I mistake not, there was another prodigious flourish of trumpets and twanging of stringed instruments; and finally the doomed individual, waiting all this while to be decapitated, got up and proceeded to make a fool of himself. A bashful young earl tried his maiden oratory on the good citizens of London, and having evidently got every word by heart (even including, however he managed it, the most seemingly casual improvisations of the moment), he really spoke like a book, and made incomparably the smoothest speech I ever heard in England.|$|E

5000|$|C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} response, including some comments by critics, most notably Richard C.

[...] Carrier's review [...] "is {{about as long as}} the book itself", Reppert noted only half-jokingly, before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> some of Carrier's criticisms. Another response to Carrier's review came from Darek Barefoot, who, while he did not [...] "find all of Reppert's arguments to be persuasive and all of Carrier's criticisms to be off-target", believed that the core of the argument from reason [...] "is sound and that Reppert's book is a landmark contribution to the subject." [...] Barefoot argued that Reppert had made a strong case for Lewis's claim [...] "that the process of inference by which consideration of premises causes us to adopt a conclusion cannot be coherently conceived of in terms of physical cause-and-effect alone." [...] Furthermore, if Reppert's version of the Argument from Reason [...] "is successful, it reveals that rationality is fundamental to the universe, not simply a by-product of physical cause-and-effect; and this, in turn, is readily explicable on theism, but problematic for naturalism." ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION : Morquio A {{syndrome}} is a rare, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disorder caused bya deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulfatase (GALNS). In 2014, {{the use of}} recombinant human GALNS, elosulfase alfa, was approved in Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, and Brazil {{for the treatment of}} Morquio A syndrome. Elosulfase alfa is administered intravenously once-weekly at a dose of 2. 0 mg/kg. AREAS COVERED : This is a review of the efficacy, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and other outcomes of elosulfase alfa treatment of patients with Morquio A. A discussion of other treatment considerations, limitations, and future directions in the use of elosulfase alfa is provided. EXPERT COMMENTARY : Pharmacokinetic studies outside of clinical trials and in “real-world” clinical settings need to be performed. We cannot currently predict which patient is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> well <b>to</b> enzyme replacement therapy; thus, all patients should be given the option to receive treatment for at least 12 months. Additionally, accurate biomarkers for evaluating disease state and drug responsiveness would greatly aid in the treatment of patients with Morquio A. In addition, improved and innovative daily lifestyle measures are greatly needed to adequately measure clinical response and true impact on quality of life.

30|$|The {{search for}} markers {{identifying}} key {{targets for the}} assessment of major outcomes in musculoskeletal diseases {{has become one of the}} hot issues in rheumatology. Possible markers should be objectively measured, indicatory of normal biology as well as the pathologic process, indicator of response to therapy and prognosis. It should also be a good indicator of modification of the pathological process and help to identify (in early cases) the patients who are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> quickly <b>to</b> therapy with the vision to tailor management to the patient status (Ferraccioli et al. 2013). So far this target has not been achieved in CTS. There have been many studies investigating US changes following CTS management, however, few ones were conducted to follow-up the changes (both NCS and US) (Jeong et al. 2011). The novel concept of using US assessment as a biomarker which can help in setting a “Treat to Target” approach tailored for CTS patients, expands the scope of using this tool in clinical practice. In this report we present a large prospective US study of CTS patients. The specific aim of the study was to assess the median nerve both by Gray-scale US and neural vascular flow (using Power Doppler (PD) before and after management. Moreover, we investigated the feasibility of initial US parameters for setting up a treatment plan tailored to the patient’s needs and its ability to predict treatment outcomes.|$|R

The only reason that the moleman had not waged such a wide attack on the building had been due to the building's heating system running and blocking off the moleman's route into the building (as he was using several underground prohibition-era bootlegging tunnels), but since the power had been shut off the moleman was able to freely access the building. Having had enough, they decide to take on the moleman and inform the building's occupants of everything that has happened. They go into the basement and succeed in killing the moleman, but discover that there wasn't one moleman but many. They barely manage to escape and light a fire in the heating system, blocking the mole men from pursuing them. The film then cuts forward to an undetermined point in time, where the two brothers have begun taking their jobs as landlords more seriously. They inform some new tenants that they must pay for all utilities except heat, as they run the heater year round due to the building being [...] "drafty" [...] (they do not inform them that it is actually done to keep mole men out of the building).

40|$|The {{combination}} of a diagnostic test with a therapeutic entity is termed theranostics. The diagnostic test aims at identifying patients who will likely benefit from a specific therapeutic intervention, fail <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> or eventually manifest side effects to a given drug. The appropriate selection of patients for innovative therapies would promote an enrichment of patient population that can potentiate clinical trials and eventually accelerate the drug development process. For these reasons many drug companies adopted a theranostic approach as a new and promising avenue for drug development. From an historical perspective, the concepts underlying the theranostic strategy are well known in nuclear medicine and constituted the basis of many nuclear imaging procedures currently used in clinical practice. Nevertheless the adoption of these concepts by regulatory authorities is a real progress and reflects the remarkable advances {{in the development of}} drugs against molecular targets. In this respect, the oncological field provides the strongest evidence of the clinical need to link diagnostics to therapeutics. Here we review the contribution that non-invasive nuclear imaging may give to cancer theranostics and report prominent examples of nuclear imaging procedures that can be coupled to specific therapies. The main focus lies on imaging procedures that can identify patients who will benefit from molecularly targeted therapy or are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fail <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> standard treatment...|$|R

50|$|From its {{earliest}} {{days as a}} British colony, British sterling coinage circulated in Fiji, supplemented by locally produced paper money. During the great depression of the 1930s, the Australian and New Zealand banks devalued their currencies in order to bolster exports to the UK. These banks also controlled the exchange rate for Fiji, and in 1933 the Fiji pound was devalued to £1.2.3 Fijian = £1 Sterling {{in order to bring}} it into line with the devalued New Zealand pound, even though the New Zealand pound would very shortly devalue further to bring it into line with the devalued Australian pound.

And this will also essentially form the text of the letter that I will send to Secretary Straw, who wrote on behalf of the European Union as the European Union President. The United States and many other countries are waging a war against terrorism. For our country this war often takes the form of conventional military operations in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Sometimes this is a political struggle, a war of ideas. It is a struggle waged also by our law enforcement agencies. Often we engage the enemy through the cooperation of our intelligence services with their foreign counterparts. We must track down terrorists who seek refuge in areas where governments cannot take effective action, including where the terrorists cannot in practice be reached by the ordinary processes of law. In such places terrorists have planned the killings of thousands of innocents – in New York City or Nairobi, in Bali or London, in Madrid or Beslan, in Casablanca or Istanbul. Just two weeks ago I also visited a hotel ballroom in Amman, viewing the silent, shattered aftermath of one of those attacks. The United States, and those countries that share the commitment to defend their citizens, will use every lawful weapon to defeat these terrorists. Protecting citizens is the first and oldest duty of any government. Sometimes these efforts are misunderstood. I want to help all of you understand the hard choices involved, and some of the responsibilities that go with them.

These results stand in contradistinction to GDT studies where the intervention group traditionally received more fluids. They also support our earlier recommendation that FR should be assessed by dynamic parameters, when appropriate, before any fluids are administered [51]. Hence the PVI may prevent unnecessary and potentially damaging fluid overload as low PVI values mean that the patient is most probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> fluids. At the same time, high PVI values may alert the clinician to the development of hypovolemia that may not be reflected by other commonly measured parameters [50, 51].|$|E
40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a {{relapsing}} and remitting {{disease with}} significant phenotypic and genotypic variability. Though {{more common in}} adults, UC is being increasingly diagnosed in childhood. The subsequent lifelong course of disease results in challenges for the patient and physician. Currently, there is no medical cure for UC. Even though surgical removal of the colon can be curative, complications including infertility in females make colectomy an option often considered only when the disease presents with life-threatening complications or when medical management fails. One {{of the greatest challenges}} the clinician faces in the care of patients with UC is the inability to predict at diagnosis which patient is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a specific therapy or will eventually require surgery. This therapeutic conundrum frames the discussion to follow, specifically the concept of individualized or personalized treatment strategies based on genetic risk factors. As we move to therapeutics, we will elucidate traditional approaches and discuss known and novel agents. As we look to the future, we can expect increasing integrated approaches using several scientific disciplines to inform how genetic interactions shape and mold the pathogenesis and therapeutics of UC...|$|E

A response model predicts if a customer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a product offering or not. Typically historical purchase data is used to model customer response. In response modeling customers are partitioned in to two groups of respondents and non-respondents. Generally, the distribution of records (respondents and nonrespondents) in marketing datasets is not balanced. The most common approach to solve class imbalance problem is by using sampling techniques. However; sampling techniques have their shortcomings. Therefore, in this research we integrated supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and presented a novel approach to address class imbalance problem. Recently hybrid data mining techniques have been proposed and they intend to improve the performance of the basic classifiers. Finally we compared the performance of the hybrid approach to that of the sampling approach. We could show that the hybrid ANN model achieved higher prediction accuracy and higher area under the curve value than the corresponding values of the bagging neural network which was trained based on the sampled training set...|$|E

The way in which this depletion affected guinea-pigs' ability <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> challenge with antigen was tested by challenging with tuberculin after sensitization and examining the ability <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> DNCB. It {{was found that the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> tuberculin was completely abrogated by the injection of Marcol and could be restored by removing the oil from the peritoneal cavity. The ability <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a secondary challenge with DNCB was not affected, while the ability to become sensitized was impaired. A normal inflammatory response was seen.
