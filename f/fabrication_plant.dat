40|$|Guidelines {{are needed}} for {{selecting}} appropriate methods of structural analyses to evaluate the seismic hazard of mixed-oxide fuel <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants.</b> This study examines the different available methods and their applicability to <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants.</b> These results should {{provide a basis for}} establishing guidelines recommending methods of analysis to ensure safe design against seismic hazards. Using the Westinghouse Recycle Fuels Plant as representative of future mixed-oxide fuel <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants,</b> critical structures and equipment (systems, components, and piping/ducting) were identified. These included the manufacturing building and 11 different pieces of equipment. After examination of the dynamic response characteristics of the building and the different methods available to analyze equipment, appropriate methods of analyses were recommended. Because critical equipment analysis and test methods generally use floor-response spectra as their seismic input loading, several methods used to generate floor spectra were also examined. These include the time-history approach and the Kapur and Biggs approximate methods. The examination included the effect of site characteristics and both horizontal and vertical structural response.

40|$|Resource {{portfolio}} {{planning is}} a frequent task in semiconductor wafer <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants,</b> as process, machine and product technologies evolve rapidly and the plants go through capacity expansion. As wafer <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> are complex integrated factories with conspicuous queuing effects, portfolio planning must take into consideration machine use, factory throughput, and total flow-time simultaneously. This paper describes a resource portfolio planning methodology for wafer <b>fabrication</b> foundry <b>plants.</b> An improved static capacity model is first presented. A portfolio planning procedure based on static capacity estimation and queuing analysis is next described. This procedure enables the solution space of resource portfolios to be explored effectively and has demonstrated a capability superior to the current planning method in an industry case study. A software implementation of the procedure {{is also used to}} clarify planning dilemmas. It is shown that empirical formu-lae can be used to estimate the efficiency of batch machines. It is also used to show three types of portfolio adjustment action: flow-time reduction, cost reduction and effectiveness improvement...|$|R

25|$|The goal of luring a {{computer}} chip <b>fabrication</b> <b>plant</b> (chip fab) {{was one of}} the earliest goals of, and reasons underlying, the Tech Valley name. The plan to get a chip fab to the Capital District predates the Tech Valley slogan. In 1997, New York set out submissions for possible chip fab sites that it could whittle to 10 sites around the state that would be pre-approved and pre-permitted for a chip plant. Years before that the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's RPI Tech Park had been visited by semiconductor companies, but they had chosen not to build. The renewed interest by the region in luring them was spurred by the research centers and training of specialists for the industry by area colleges such as the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Hudson Valley Community College. Responding to the state's request for potential sites, Rensselaer County proposed the same RPI Tech Park site; Schenectady County proposed two sites, one of which was in Hillside Industrial Park in Niskayuna; Saratoga County proposed two sites; and Albany County proposed three sites, two in Bethlehem and one in Guilderland. The state ultimately decided on 13 sites it would aggressively promote, most of which were in Tech Valley. As one of the thirteen sites chosen, the RPI Tech Park site originally met little opposition from the town of North Greenbush in which it sat. As time progressed opposition grew in response to concerns about potential impacts on traffic and the environment. The RPI Tech Park site, which by October 1999 had become one of only nine sites still being marketed by the state, ended when the North Greenbush town council voted to terminate the review process. A site in Wallkill, Orange County was the first site in Tech Valley and in the entire state to receive pre-approval for a chip fab.|$|E
40|$|Before {{development}} of an emission standard for vinyl chloride, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted three programs to measure vinyl chloride (VC) concentrations in air around plants which either manufacture VC or use it. A brief monitoring survey conducted by EPA Regional Offices found VC in ambient air around poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) production plants. As a consequence of this survey, a second monitoring program was established to measure VC in the air around VC and PVC production plants. This program found some relatively high concentrations of VC in ambient air around the plants. This program found maximum 24 -hr average concentrations ranging from 0. 32 to 10. 6 parts of VC per million parts of air. The program also found an apparent relationship between certain emission excursions and ambient VC concentrations. A third monitoring program was established to measure VC around PVC <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants.</b> This monitoring program found much less VC around PVC <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> than around VC and PVC production plants. In conclusion, VC was found in ambient air around VC production <b>plants</b> and PVC <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants.</b> However, {{the data show that}} much less VC escapes into surrounding air from PVC fabricating plants than from VC and PVC production plants...|$|R

2500|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry, including IC manufacturing, design, and packing, forms a {{major part}} of Taiwan's IT industry. Due to its strong capabilities in OEM wafer manufacturing and a complete industry supply chain, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors. The sector output reached US$39 billion in 2009, ranking first in global market share in IC manufacturing, packaging, and testing, and second in IC design. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest [...] contract chipmakers in the world, while MediaTek is the fourth-largest fabless supplier globally. In 1987, TSMC pioneered the fabless foundry model, reshaping the global semiconductor industry. From ITRI's first 3-inch wafer <b>fabrication</b> <b>plant</b> built in 1977 and the founding of UMC in 1980, the industry has developed into a world leader with 40 fabs in operation by 2002. In 2007, the semiconductor industry overtook that of the United States, second only to Japan. Although the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010 affected sales and exports, the industry has rebounded with companies posting record profits for 2010. Taiwan has the largest share of 300nm, 90nm, and 60nm manufacturing capacities worldwide, and was expected to pass Japan in total IC fab capacity by mid-2011.|$|E
2500|$|Mazzocchi was {{a friend}} and confidante of Karen Silkwood. Silkwood was a {{technician}} at a Kerr-McGee nuclear fuel milling, conversion, enrichment, and fuel rod <b>fabrication</b> <b>plant</b> in Crescent, Oklahoma, about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City. [...] Silkwood, a newly elected union representative, became concerned that Kerr-McGee officials were falsifying records about {{the integrity of the}} plant's plutonium nuclear fuel rods. Silkwood and two other workers met with Mazzocchi in Washington, D.C., the week of September 26, 1974. Although Mazzocchi was preoccupied with his asbestos fight, he spent a day talking to the three workers. They knew almost nothing about the dangers of the materials they were working with, and Mazzocchi helped educate them about these hazards. At this meeting, Silkwood revealed that she was aware Kerr-McGee may have falsified its quality-control records. Mazzocchi arranged for the three to testify before the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) regarding safety failures at the Crescent plant. [...] Mazzocchi also outlined a two-point plan for the workers to follow. First, they would pursue the safety lapses with the AEC. [...] Second, and more importantly, Mazzocchi asked Silkwood to collect more information on the quality lapses. She was not to take any documents, but was to take notes on documents, record what she observed, and begin building a case. Mazzocchi believed that by leaking documents to the press and following up with public testimony, he could create the same public cry for change that had proven so successful in the OSHA campaign. When Silkwood found that she had been contaminated with plutonium in the weeks before her death, Mazzocchi feared that Kerr-McGee might pinpoint Silkwood as the source of the documents OCAW intended to leak to the New York Times.|$|E
