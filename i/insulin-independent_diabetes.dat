40|$|Terminally ill insulin-deficient rodents with {{uncontrolled}} diabetes due to autoimmune {{or chemical}} destruction of β-cells were made hyperleptinemic by adenoviral {{transfer of the}} leptin gene. Within ≈ 10 days their severe hyperglycemia and ketosis were corrected. Despite the lack of insulin, moribund animals resumed linear growth and appeared normal. Normoglycemia persisted 10 – 80 days without other treatment; normal physiological conditions lasted for ≈ 175 days despite reappearance of moderate hyperglycemia. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis by suppression of hyperglucagonemia and reduction of hepatic cAMP response element-binding protein, phoshoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator- 1 α may explain the anticatabolic effect. Up-regulation of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) expression and plasma levels and increasing IGF- 1 receptor phosphorylation in muscle may explain the increased insulin receptor substrate 1, PI 3 K, and ERK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that leptin reverses the catabolic consequences of total lack of insulin, potentially by suppressing glucagon action on liver and enhancing the insulinomimetic actions of IGF- 1 on skeletal muscle, and suggest strategies for making type 1 <b>diabetes</b> <b>insulin-independent...</b>|$|R

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is a leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality among noncommunicable diseases, and additional animal models that more closely replicate the pathogenesis of human type 2 diabetes are needed. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a model of type 2 diabetes in guinea pigs, in which diet-induced glucose intolerance precedes β-cell cytotoxicity, two processes that are crucial to the development of human type 2 diabetes. Guinea pigs developed impaired glucose tolerance after 8  weeks of feeding on a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, as determined by oral glucose challenge. Diet-induced glucose intolerance was accompanied by β-cell hyperplasia, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia with hepatocellular steatosis. Streptozotocin (STZ) treatment alone was ineffective at inducing diabetic hyperglycemia in guinea pigs, which failed to develop sustained glucose intolerance or fasting hyperglycemia and returned to euglycemia within 21  days after treatment. However, when high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet-fed guinea pigs were treated with STZ, glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia persisted beyond 21  days post-STZ treatment. Guinea pigs with diet-induced glucose intolerance subsequently treated with STZ demonstrated an insulin-secretory capacity consistent with <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes.</b> This insulin-independent state was confirmed by response to oral antihyperglycemic drugs, metformin and glipizide, which resolved glucose intolerance and extended survival compared with guinea pigs with uncontrolled diabetes. In this study, we have developed a model of sequential glucose intolerance and β-cell loss, through high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet and extensive optimization of STZ treatment in the guinea pig, which closely resembles human type 2 diabetes. This model will prove useful in the study of <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> pathogenesis with or without comorbidities, where the guinea pig serves as a relevant model species...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Maturity-onset {{diabetes}} of {{the young}} (MODY) is a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by an early onset of <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and a primary defect in beta-cell. There are six subtypes of MODY. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most frequent. CASE OUTLINE We present a nine-year-old boy with intermittent hyperglycaemia. According to family history, the diagnosis of MODY 2 was suspected. Molecular analysis revealed novel missense mutation R 250 c in exon 7 of glucokinase gene. Mutation (c. 748 C>T) {{is the result of}} substitution of aminoacid cysteine by arginine (p. Arg 250 Cys). This is the first pediatric patient with MODY 2 in Serbia whose diagnosis is established at molecular level. CONCLUSION Molecular diagnosis of MODY has important consequences in terms of prognosis, therapy and family screening of the disorder. Investigation of other patients with MODY 2 in our country is important to establish prevalence and nature of mutations in glucokinase gene...|$|E

Those are diabetes mellitus, hepatomegaly, and hypothyroidism. The patient has a past medical history significant for a transmural inferior wall myocardial infarct (MI) in 1975, complicated by mild congestive heart failure, and a subsequent subendocardial MI one month later. At that time, her only major problem noted was obesity, which was long-standing. Her weight in 1975 was 220 pounds. She was followed in the Primary Care Center, and in 1976 she was first noted to be hyperglycemic.

40|$|We {{have found}} complement-dependent {{cytotoxic}} antibodies in the serum of 8 of 24 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus using a 51 Cr cytotoxicity assay with monolayers of cloned rat islet cells (clones RINm 5 F and RINm 14 B). In contrast, complement-dependent cytotoxicity with 51 Cr release greater than 24 % {{was found with}} sera from 34 controls or from 5 patients with polyglandular failure without diabetes, and was present in only 1 serum our of 12 from patients with <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. The prevalence of antibodies appears to decrease with duration of insulin-dependent diabetes, and in one patient studied, cytotoxic antibodies were present {{at the time of}} diagnosis of diabetes. Cytotoxicity is independent of insulin synthesis, as evidenced by the linear correlation of cytotoxicity of sera for the insulin-producing clone RINm 5 F and the somatostatin-producing clone RINm 14 B.

40|$|The pseudooligosaccharide {{acarbose}} is {{a potent}} inhibitor of amylases, glucosidases, and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and is clinically used {{for the treatment of}} so-called type II or <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes.</b> The compound consists of an unsaturated aminocyclitol, a deoxyhexose, and a maltose. The unsaturated aminocyclitol moiety (also called valienamine) is primarily responsible for the inhibition of glucosidases. Due to its structural similarity to maltotetraose, we have investigated whether acarbose is recognized as a substrate by the maltose/maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli. Acarbose at millimolar concentrations specifically affected the growth of E. coli K- 12 on maltose as the sole source of carbon and energy. Uptake of radiolabeled maltose was competitively inhibited by acarbose, with a Ki of 1. 1 μM. Maltose-grown cells transported radiolabeled acarbose, indicating that the compound is recognized as a substrate. Studying the interaction of acarbose with purified maltoporin in black lipid membranes revealed that the kinetics of acarbose binding to LamB is asymmetric. The on-rate of acarbose is approximately 30 times lower when the molecule enters the pore from the extracellular side than when it enters from the periplasmic side. Acarbose could not be utilized as a carbon source since the compound alone was not a substrate of amylomaltase (MalQ) and was only poorly attacked by maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{clinical}} and metabolic studies {{of a newly}} delineated lipomatosis, characterised by an abnormal mediastinal and abdominal accumulation of fat, without obesity. The clinical features, which occurred in all the patients studied, are: Exertional dyspnoea due to a space-occupying mediastinal accumulation of fat, without evidence of cardiac or pulmonary disease. A pseudo-ascitic abdominal enlargement, due to intra- and retroperitoneal accumulation of fatty tissue. <b>Insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. Type IV hyperlipidaemia and elevated levels of plasma uric acid were observed in four patients. Intra-abdominal lipomatous tissue, obtained during laparoscopy from four patients, demonstrated a reduced lipolytic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, fat deposition in the abdominal and mediastinal areas could be causally related to defective lipid mobilization in lipomatocytes. Lipoprotein lipase activity in abdominal adipose tissue were normal in two patients (10. 0 and 10. 6 nmol/g/min) and markedly elevated in another two patients (37. 3 and 49. 9 nmol/g/min), as compared with controls (12. 7 +/- 2. 1 nmol/g/min). When expressed on per cell basis, LPL activity in lipomatous tissue {{was significantly higher than}} in control tissue (3. 21 +/- 1. 1 nmol/ 10 (5) cell/min vs 0. 92 +/- 0. 16 nmol/ 10 (5) cell/min).

40|$|Social {{isolation}} {{contributes to}} the development of obesity and <b>insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> in KKAy mice. Here we show that systemic administration of liraglutide, a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) analog, significantly decreased food intake, body weight, and blood glucose levels at 24 [*]h after its administration while having no significant effects on plasma insulin and glucagon levels in individually housed KKAy mice. In addition, the systemic administration of liraglutide significantly increased plasma fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 21 levels (1. 8 -fold increase) associated with increases in the expression of hepatic Fgf 21 (1. 9 -fold increase) and Pparγ (1. 8 -fold increase), while having no effects on the expression of hepatic Pparα and Fgf 21 in white adipose tissue. Moreover, systemic administration of liraglutide over 3 days significantly suppressed food intake, body weight gain, and hyperglycemia in KKAy mice. On the other hand, despite remarkably increased plasma active GLP- 1 levels (4. 2 -fold increase), the ingestion of alogliptin, a selective dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor, over 3 days had no effects on food intake, body weight, blood glucose levels, and plasma Fgf 21 levels in KKAy mice. These findings suggest that systemic administration of liraglutide induces hepatic Fgf 21 production and suppresses the social isolation-induced obesity and diabetes independently of insulin, glucagon, and active GLP- 1 in KKAy mice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is {{a common}} but often unrecognized systemic disorder observed mainly in the elderly.

40|$|Background—Maternal {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is associated with}} an increased risk of offspring congenital heart defects (CHD); however, the causal mechanism is poorly understood. We further investigated this association in a Danish nationwide cohort. Methods and Results—In a national cohort study, we identified 2   025   727 persons born from 1978 to 2011; among them were 7296 (0. 36 %) persons exposed to maternal pregestational {{diabetes mellitus}}. Pregestational diabetes mellitus was identified by using the National Patient Register and individual-level information on all prescriptions filled in Danish pharmacies. Persons with CHD (n= 16   325) were assigned to embryologically related cardiac phenotypes. The CHD prevalence in the offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus was 318 per 10   000 live births (n= 232) in comparison with a baseline risk of 80 per 10   000; the adjusted relative risk for CHD was 4. 00 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 51 – 4. 53). The association was not modified by year of birth, maternal age at diabetes onset, or diabetes duration, and CHD risks associated with type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (<b>insulin-independent)</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus did not differ significantly. Persons born to women with previous acute diabetes complications had a higher CHD risk than those exposed to maternal diabetes mellitus without complications (relative risk, 7. 62; 95 % confidence interval, 5. 23 – 10. 6, and relative risk, 3. 49; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 91 – 4. 13, respectively; P= 0. 0004). All specific CHD phenotypes were associated with maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus (relative risk range, 2. 74 – 13. 8). Conclusions—The profoundly increased CHD risk conferred by maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus neither changed over time nor differed by diabetes subtype. The association with acute pregestational diabetes complications was particularly strong, suggesting a role for glucose in the causal pathway. </p...|$|E

After examination, 28 individuals were considered to be adult males; 11 adult females; three adults of indeterminate sex and nine individuals were of sub adult age. The mean age at death for adults was 36. 8  years. Seventeen adult individuals (40. 4 % of all adults), displayed ossifications of at least four contiguous spinal levels and/or multiple enthesopathies of the appendicular skeleton and were therefore, assigned the diagnosis DISH. The mean age of these individuals was 49. 5  ±  13. 0  years. In at least three of these individuals, DISH had led to extensive ossification and subsequent ankylosis of axial and peripheral skeletal structures. In this population of (presumably) clergymen and high-ranking citizens, DISH was observed in unusual high numbers at a relatively young age. Some of the examined cases suggest that DISH may be a seriously incapacitating disorder when the more advanced stages of the disease have been reached. It is hypothesized that “a monastic way of life” can predispose to DISH. Present demographic trends in obesity and diabetes mellitus as potential co-factors for the development of DISH warrant further study to investigate its future prevalence...|$|E

Besides, in the given patients the values (in m/s) of the motor (MBP) and of the sensitive transmission rate (SBP) of the impulse along the nervus peroneus (NP) and the nervus tibialis (NT) are also determined. The control group consisted of 50 healthy persons of respective age. On the same day when the electrophysiological examination was done, the following biochemic parameters were determined in the patients' serum, namely, the glycemia profile with calculation of the glycemia average value (MBG) {{as well as the}} values of the glycolized chemoglobine (HgAl), of the basal insulin level and of sodium (Na) and potassium (K). After that, the correlation between the given electrophysiological and the biochemic parameters was examined as well as that between the given parameters and the age of the examined and the diabetes duration. A statistically significant correlation (p (),() 5) between the values of the other examined parameters registered. The obtained results show that hyperglycemia causes the emergence of the transitory dysfunction of the NTR and/or the NF in the {{patients with}} the IND and the clinically mild DN. The dysfunction of the NTR and/or the NF is approximately symmetrically present on {{the left and the right}} side in the patients with the IND and the clinically mild DN while in the persons with the IZD and the clinically mild DN there is asymmetry of the functional disturbance in the system of the NT-NF complex which is probably related to different effects of the right and left brain hemispheres structure upon the function of the BR reflex arc parts in the brain stem. In the given patients (with the IZD and the clinically mild DN) there are more prominent and lasting functional disturbances at the NTR and/or NF level since such persons suffer from diabetes for a considerably longer period of time.

40|$|Bile acids are {{essential}} physiological molecules which carry out multiple {{functions such as}} facilitating the absorption of dietary lipids and regulating the metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids. The formation of bile represents the major route for elimination of excess cholesterol, either by conversion of cholesterol into bile acids or excretion of intact cholesterol in mixed micelles. The primary bile acids consist of cholic acid (CA), chenodoxycholic acid (CDCA), and in the mouse beta-muricholic acid (beta-MCA). Synthesis of CA requires sterol 12 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP 8 B 1), a membrane-bound enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum in the hepatocytes. Cyp 8 b 1 -/- mice are unable to produce CA, have reduced cholesterol absorption, and a compensatory increased bile acid synthesis. The present studies aimed to investigate the cellular distribution of CYP 8 B 1, and evaluate its role for the bile acid synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis. Specific antibodies against selected peptides of CYP 8 B 1 {{were used for the}} immunohistochemical studies. The results demonstrated a species difference concerning the distribution of CYP 8 B 1, as an even distribution was found throughout the liver lobuli in humans, whereas a zonal expression was seen in mice, with an increasing gradient from the portal areas towards the central veins. Such a pattern was also observed for the histochemical distribution of mouse Cyp 7 a 1. Cyp 8 b 1 -/- mice were found to accumulate much less hepatic cholesterol than Cyp 8 b 1 +/+ mice when fed cholesterol or CA, mainly due to a decreased cholesterol absorption and increased bile acid synthesis through upregulation of the Cyp 7 a 1 expression. The high rate of cholesterol synthesis in Cyp 8 b 1 -/- mice was associated with increased levels of SREBP 2 mRNA and the corresponding precursor protein. Cholesterol-fed Cyp 8 b 1 -/- mice generated higher plasma HDL-cholesterol. After feeding a diet with cholesterol plus CA, cholesterol crystals were found in the bile of Cyp 8 b 1 +/+ but not of Cyp 8 b 1 -/- animals. <b>Insulin-independent</b> <b>diabetes</b> was induced by alloxan in both Cyp 8 b 1 -/- and +/+ mice fed cholesterol for 9 - 10 weeks. Alloxan/cholesterol treated Cyp 8 b 1 +/+ mice displayed significantly increased levels of serum cholesterol, and their bile was supersaturated with cholesterol, containing plenty of cholesterol crystals. In addition they had elevated levels of hepatic Abcg 5 /g 8 mRNA. These effects were all absent in the Cyp 8 bl -/- mice or in +/+ animals treated only with alloxan. Our results indicate a crucial role of Cyp 8 b 1 /CA for cholesterol homeostasis in the mouse, suggesting that inhibition of Cyp 8 b 1 may have beneficial effects such as preventing liver cholesterol accumulation and gallstone formation. In addition, such inhibition might also favorably affect the plasma lipid levels under diabetic condition, which may confer anti-atherogenic effects...|$|E
