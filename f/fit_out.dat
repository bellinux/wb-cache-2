5|$|Carpender {{returned}} to sea duty in September 1939, when he helped <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> a new destroyer squadron, Destroyer Squadron 32. He commanded it until September 1940, {{when he became}} Director of Officer Personnel at the Bureau of Navigation. In this capacity, he helped foster the careers of many other officers. In December 1941 {{he was promoted to}} rear admiral, as Commander Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In December 1917, Carpender {{became an}} aide to the Commander, Destroyer Flotillas Operating in European Waters. In August 1918 he {{reported}} to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company to help <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> the new destroyer , and assumed command of the ship when it was commissioned on 30 September 1918. The ship sailed for Europe in October 1918, escorting a convoy.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales {{government}} made a proclamation which transferred {{control of the}} Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton {{had to settle for}} the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which he was able to acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E

25|$|While Carpenter <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> at Norfolk, the ship's {{designation}} {{was changed}} to DDE (escort destroyer) on 4 March 1950. Like her three sister ships, , , and , Carpenter conducted a shakedown cruise and intensive ASW training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, later that spring. On 26 June the destroyer got underway for the Pacific, transited the Panama Canal on 1 July, and arrived at her new homeport, Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 13 July.|$|E
25|$|During his World War I {{service in}} Wyoming, Carpenter {{received}} temporary promotions to Lieutenant (junior grade) (Lt.JG) (October 3, 1917) and Lieutenant (February 6, 1918); permanent promotions to those ranks followed, on March 12, 1920 and March 31, 1921, respectively. Detached from Wyoming on May 16, 1921, Carpenter reported to Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, five days later, {{and over the}} ensuing months, helped <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> the new battleship California (BB-44).|$|E
25|$|Venice {{developed}} {{methods of}} mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system {{to replace the}} Roman hull-first practice. This new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could <b>fit</b> <b>out,</b> arm, and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

25|$|Melampus, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered on 1 May 1816, laid down in August 1817 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales, and {{launched}} on 10 August 1820. She was completed for ordinary at Plymouth Dockyard 2–23 September 1829 and was roofed over from the mainmast forward. The ship cost £23,007 to built and £7,072 to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> for ordinary. She was fitted out for sea at a total cost of £9,156 from March to 18 May 1845.|$|E
25|$|After the Home Service {{men and the}} unfit {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the 2/4th Bn, the 1/4th was brought up to strength with recruits and training continued at Bury St Edmunds. The battalion moved to Thetford in Norfolk in November 1914. At Easter 1915 the East Anglian Division moved into the coast defences, the 1/4th Bn being stationed in Norwich. In May the battalion moved back to Bury St Edmunds to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> with tropical kit for overseas service. The 1st East Anglian Division was now numbered as the 54th (East Anglian) Division, with the East Midlands Brigade becoming 162nd (East Midland) Brigade. On 29 July the 1/4th Northamptons entrained, and sailed the following day from Devonport aboard the transport Royal George.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Carthaginian senate {{reinstated}} Hanno {{and forced}} Hamilcar to share command. The Punic generals pursued Matho’s army and won several small-scale engagements. After mustering their forces, a decisive battle was fought probably {{near the town}} of Leptis Minor. The Carthaginians destroyed the rebel army, after which the Libyan towns submitted to Carthage. When Utica and Hippo Acra held out, Hanno and Hamilcar besieged them, eventually receiving their surrender on terms. By the winter of 238 BC, the Mercenary revolt was over. Hanno and Hamilcar unleashed reprisals against the Numidian tribes that had sided with the rebels, and the generals probably extended Carthaginian territory in Africa at the same time. Carthage now began to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> an expedition to recover Sardinia, with Hamilcar commanding Punic forces.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{materiel}} on {{the beaches}} was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions. The British Army needed months to re-supply properly and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports. Some of these antique workhorses were still in use {{as late as the}} North African campaign of 1942.|$|E
25|$|Bolts {{refused to}} give up on his hopes for a voyage to the North West coast of America. Emperor Joseph II {{released}} Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of Catherine II of Russia. The Russian Court proved unresponsive, so Bolts also put his proposal before the court of Joseph’s brother-in-law, Ferdinand IV, King of Naples He had an encouraging response from Naples, where King Ferdinand’s Minister of Commerce and the Navy, General Sir John Acton, wanted to promote the kingdom’s maritime trade. King Ferdinand gave Bolts a charter, modelled on that he had received from the Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, with a term of twenty-one years from 1786, for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Società del India di Napoli), but the Neapolitan government agreed to support Bolts only after he had made a successful initial voyage at his own expense and risk. Preparations were begun in Marseilles to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag, but the venture was abandoned when Bolts received a more positive response from the French government.|$|E
