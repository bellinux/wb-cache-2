40|$|Abstract—In {{independent}} {{component analysis}} (ICA), {{when using the}} one-unit contrast function optimization approach to estimate independent components one by one, the constraint of uncorrelatedness between independent components prevents the algorithm from converging to the previously found components. A popular way to achieve uncorrelatedness is the Gram–Schmidt-like decorrelation scheme. In fact, uncorrelatedness between independent components {{can be achieved by}} reducing the degree of freedom in the unknown parameter set of the de-mixing matrix. In this letter, we propose to exploit the dimension-reduction technique to exactly enforce uncorrelatedness between difference independent components. The advantage of this method is that dimension reduction of the observations and de-mixing weight vectors makes the computation complexity lower and produces a faster convergence. Hence, our method results in a faster algorithm in computation of <b>ICA.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Decorrelation, dimension-reduction, Gram– Schmidt-like decorrelation, independent component analysi...|$|E

40|$|While it {{has long}} been known that the pupil reacts to {{cognitive}} load, pupil size has received little attention in cognitive research because of its long latency and the difficulty of separating effects of cognitive load from the light reflex or effects due to eye movements. A novel measure, the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA), relates cognitive effort to the frequency of small rapid dilations of the pupil. We report here on a total of seven experiments which test whether the <b>ICA</b> reliably <b>indexes</b> linguistically induced cognitive load: three experiments in reading (a manipulation of grammatical gender match/mismatch, an experiment of semantic fit, and an experiment comparing locally ambiguous subject versus object relative clauses, all in German), three dual-task experiments with simultaneous driving and spoken language comprehension (using the same manipulations as in the single-task reading experiments), and a visual world experiment comparing the processing of causal versus concessive discourse markers. These experiments are the first to investigate the effect and time course of the ICA in language processing. All of our experiments support the idea that the <b>ICA</b> <b>indexes</b> linguistic processing difficulty. The effects of our linguistic manipulations on the ICA are consistent for reading and auditory presentation. Furthermore, our experiments show that the ICA allows for usage within a multi-task paradigm. Its robustness with respect to eye movements means that it is a valid measure of processing difficulty for usage within the visual world paradigm, which will allow researchers to assess both visual attention and processing difficulty at the same time, using an eye-tracker. We argue that the ICA is indicative of activity in the locus caeruleus area of the brain stem, which has recently also been linked to P 600 effects observed in psycholinguistic EEG experiments...|$|R

40|$|Many source {{separation}} algorithms fail {{to deliver}} robust performance {{when applied to}} signals recorded using high-density microphone arrays where distance between sensor elements is {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of the sig-nal of interest. This can be attributed to limited dynamic range (determined by analog-to-digital conversion) of the sensor which is insufficient to overcome the artifacts due to cross-channel redundancy, non-homogenous mixing and high-dimensionality of the signal space. In this paper we propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating learning algorithms directly with analog-to-digital conversion.

Indeed, {{at the very beginning}} of seizures, ictal EEG has a low amplitude and its morphology in the time domain is quite similar to muscular activity. Contrary to the time domain, ictal signals have specific characteristics in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we use the time-frequency signature of ictal discharges as a priori information on the sources of interest. To extract the time-frequency signature of ictal sources, we use the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method. Then we propose two time-frequency based semi-blind source separation approaches, namely the Time-Frequency-Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (TF-GEVD) and the Time-Frequency-Denoising Source Separation (TF-DSS), for the denoising of ictal signals based on these time-frequency signatures.

40|$|Abstract—An {{unsupervised}} classification algorithm is derived by modeling observed data as {{a mixture of}} several mutually exclusive classes that are each described by linear combinations of independent, non-Gaussian densities. The algorithm estimates the data density in each class by using parametric nonlinear functions that fit to the non-Gaussian structure of the data. This improves classification accuracy compared with standard Gaussian mixture models. When applied to images, the algorithm can learn efficient codes (basis functions) for images that capture the statistically significant structure intrinsic in the images. We apply this technique {{to the problem of}} {{unsupervised classification}}, segmentation, and denoising of images. We demonstrate that this method was effective in classifying complex image textures such as natural scenes and text. It was also useful for denoising and filling in missing pixels in images with complex structures. The advantage of this model is that image codes can be learned with increasing numbers of classes thus providing greater flexibility in modeling structure and in finding more image features than in either Gaussian mixture models or standard independent component analysis (<b>ICA)</b> algorithms. <b>Index</b> Terms—Blind source separation, denoising, fill-in missing data, Gaussian mixture model, image coding, independent component analysis, maximum likelihood, segmentation, unsupervised classification.

40|$|Abstract—Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) has proven quite {{useful for the}} analysis of real world datasets such as functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) data, where the underlying nature of the data is hard to model. It is particularly useful {{for the analysis of}} fMRI data in its native complex form since very {{little is known about the}} nature of phase. Phase information has been discarded in most analyses as it is particularly noisy. In this paper, we show that a complex ICA approach using a flexible nonlinearity that adapts to the source density is the more desirable one for performing ICA of complex fMRI data compared to those that use fixed nonlinearity, especially when noise level is high. By adaptively matching the underlying fMRI density model, the analysis performance can be improved in terms of both the estimation of spatial maps and the task-related time courses, especially for the estimation of phase of the time course.

40|$|Abstract — When {{exploiting}} independent {{component analysis}} (ICA) to perform blind source separation (BSS), {{it is assumed}} that sources are mutually independent. However, in practice, the latent sources are usually dependent to some extent. Subband decomposition ICA (SDICA) is an extension of ICA to admit source dependence. It assumes that each source is represented as the sum of some independent sub-components and dependent sub-components, which have different frequency bands. In this paper we aim at developing approaches to find the optimal filter which enhances independence between such sources and allows successful BSS by ICA. We first investigate the feasibility of separating the SDICA mixture in an adaptive manner. Second, by minimizing the mutual information between outputs, we develop an adaptive method for SDICA, namely band selective ICA (BS-ICA), which finds both the mixing matrix and the estimate of the source independent sub-components. We also consider the case where sources are the same type of natural signals and some sources are available, and the known sources help to estimate the filter more reliably. Third, we investigate the overcomplete ICA problems with sources having specific frequency characteristics, which BS-ICA {{can also be used to}} solve. Experimental results illustrate the success of the proposed approach for solving both SDICA and the overcomplete <b>ICA</b> problems. <b>Index</b> Terms — Subband decomposition ICA, Frequency representation...|$|R

The purpose of this cross-sectional {{study was to investigate}} the association between carotid artery PI, cardiovascular risk and ischaemic heart disease in aging women. Methods One hundred and fifty-eight female participants of the Longitudinal Assessment of Ageing in Women study, aged 48 - 85 years, were evaluated. The relationships between common carotid artery (CCA) and ICA Doppler PI to cardiovascular risk factors (age, body mass index, systolic and mean arterial blood pressure, smoking and diabetes), carotid-femoral (femPWV) and carotid-radial (radPWV) pulse wave velocities, and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) were assessed using Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation (ρ), multiple regression and logistic regression. Dependent variables were Box-Cox transformed to meet linear regression assumptions. Results CCA and ICA PI were significantly correlated to femPWV (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 414 and ρ[*]=[*] 0. 544, respectively). Cardiovascular risk factors were significantly predictive of CCA PI (Adj R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 176, P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01); however, their relationship to ICA PI (Adj R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 508, P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01) was stronger.

40|$|Abstract Background Acariformes is {{the most}} species-rich and morphologically diverse {{radiation}} of chelicerate arthropods, known from the oldest terrestrial ecosystems. It is also a key lineage in understanding the evolution of this group, with the most vexing question whether mites, or Acari (Parasitiformes and Acariformes) is monophyletic. Previous molecular studies recovered Acari either as monophyletic or non-monophyletic, albeit with a limited taxon sampling. Similarly, relationships between basal acariform groups (include little-known, deep-soil 'endeostigmatan' mites) and major lineages of Acariformes (Sarcoptiformes, Prostigmata) are virtually unknown. We infer phylogeny of chelicerate arthropods, using a large and representative dataset, comprising all main in- and outgroups (228 taxa). Basal diversity of Acariformes is particularly well sampled. With this dataset, we conduct a series of phylogenetically explicit tests of chelicerate and acariform relationships and present a phylogenetic framework for internal relationships of acariform mites. Results Our molecular data strongly support a diphyletic Acari, with Acariformes as the sister group to Solifugae (PP = 1. 0; BP[*]=[*] 100), the so called Poecilophysidea. Among Acariformes, some representatives of the basal group Endeostigmata (mainly deep-soil mites) were recovered as sister-groups to the remaining Acariformes (i. e., Trombidiformes[*]+[*]and most of Sarcoptiformes). Desmonomatan oribatid mites (soil and litter mites) were recovered as the monophyletic sister group of Astigmata (e. g., stored product mites, house dust mites, mange mites, feather and fur mites). Trombidiformes (Sphaerolichida[*]+[*]Prostigmata) is strongly supported (PP = 1. 0; BP[*]=[*] 98 – 100). Labidostommatina was inferred as the basal lineage of Prostigmata. Eleutherengona (e. g., spider mites) and Parasitengona (e. g., chiggers, fresh water mites) were recovered as monophyletic. By contrast, Eupodina (e. g., snout mites and relatives) was not. Marine mites (Halacaridae) were traditionally regarded as the sister-group to Bdelloidea (Eupodina), but our analyses show their close relationships to Parasitengona. Conclusions Non-trivial relationships recovered by our analyses with high support (i. e., basal arrangement of endeostigmatid lineages, the position of marine mites, polyphyly of Eupodina) had been  proposed by previous underappreciated morphological studies. Thus, we update currently the accepted taxonomic classification to reflect these results: the superfamily Halacaroidea Murray, 1877 is moved from the infraorder Eupodina Krantz, 1978 to Anystina van der Hammen, 1972; and the subfamily Erythracarinae Oudemans, 1936 (formerly in Anystidae Oudemans, 1902) is elevated to family rank, Erythracaridae stat. ressur., leaving Anystidae only with the nominal subfamily. Our study also shows that a clade comprising early derivative Endeostigmata (Alycidae, Nanorchestidae, Nematalycidae, and maybe Alicorhagiidae) {{should be treated as}} a taxon with the same rank as Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes, and the scope of the superfamily Bdelloidea should  be changed. Before turning those findings into nomenclatural changes, however, we consider that our study calls for (i) finding shared apomorphies of the early derivative Endeostigmata clade and the clade including the remaining Acariformes; (ii) a well-supported hypothesis  for Alicorhagiidae placement; (iii) sampling the families Proterorhagiidae, Proteonematalycidae and Grandjeanicidae not yet included in molecular analyses; (iv) undertake a denser sampling of clades traditionally placed in Eupodina, Anystina (Trombidiformes) and Palaeosomata (Sarcoptiformes), since consensus networks and Internode certainty (IC) and IC All (<b>ICA)</b> <b>indices</b> indicate high levels of conflict in these tree regions.

The main aim of this research was to map landslide-affected areas using remote sensing techniques for the central region of Kenya, where landslide disasters are common occurrences. The study area has a highly rugged terrain, and rainfall has been the main trigger of recent landslide events. False colour composite (FCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (<b>ICA),</b> spectral <b>indices</b> in the form of Normalised Difference Index (NDI), and knowledge-based classification formed the methodology. PCA and ICA were performed on Landsat data sets, and the components with the most geologic information after factor loading analysis were chosen to be used in a colour composite. The blue component of the colour composite was a spectral index involving bands 7 and 3 for Landsat ETM+, or bands 7 and 4 for Landsat OLI. The FCC formed the inputs for knowledge based classification with the following 13 classes: runoff, extreme erosions, other erosions, landslide areas, highly erodible, stable, weathering rocks, agriculture, green, new forest regrowth areas, as well as clear, turbid, and salty water. Validation of the mapped landslide areas with field GPS locations of landslide affected areas showed that 66 % and 62 % of the points coincided well with landslide areas mapped in the years 2000 and 2014, respectively. The classification maps showed extreme erosions taking place along drainage channels and other erosions in agricultural areas; with highly eroble zones charchaterised by already weathered rocks or deposit area, while fluvial deposits mainly characterised runoff areas.

This is a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) quantitative cross-sectional study of ICA tortuosity, ectasia and intercarotid distance in acromegalic patients with subsequent analysis of concomitant clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging findings. METHODS: One hundred seventy six acromegalic patients (mean-age 55 ± 14 years, age range 21 - 88, 92 females) and 104 subjects with headache or transient neurological deficits underwent MRA with the same 1. 5 T scanner. Clinical data, laboratory and pituitary adenoma imaging findings were recorded. Using a commercially available software, we measured the tortuosity <b>index</b> [(curved/linear <b>ICA</b> length from C 3 -midpoint to intracranial bifurcation) - 1], <b>ICA</b> ectasia <b>index</b> (intracavernous/petrous <b>ICA</b> diameter) and intercarotid distance at C 3 and C 4 levels. RESULTS: Mean ICA tortuosity and ectasia indices were increased in acromegalic patients compared with controls (1. 06 ± 0. 29 vs 0. 93 ± 0. 26, p < 0. 001; 1. 02 ± 0. 10 vs 0. 92 ± 0. 09, p < 0. 001). Mean intercarotid distance was reduced at C 3 and increased at C 4 in acromegalic patients (16. 7 ± 3. 4 vs 17. 9 ± 2. 5 mm, p < 0. 001; 16. 7 ± 4. 6 vs 15. 4 ± 4. 1 mm, p < 0. 05; t test). ICA tortuosity and ectasia correlated neither with laboratory findings nor with previous or current treatment. On multivariate analysis, C 3 intercarotid distance was reduced in patients on dopamine agonist treatment (p < 0. 01) and increased in patients with GH-deficit (p = 0. 01), while C 4 intercarotid distance was increased with macroadenoma (p = 0. 01) and reduced in patients under dopamine agonist (p < 0. 01) or somatostatin analogue (p < 0. 05) treatment.

The results of analysis show that the value of high‐tech export from the V 4 countries varies, and the V 4 countries score lower in the ranking of EU countries arranged by the value of ICA is than in the ranking of EU countries arranged by the value of high‐tech export. The  relation  between  the  value  of  high‐tech export and the value of ICA was negative for the V 4 countries, but models created with the data for all EU countries showed a positive correlation. Identify the causes of such a situation could be very valuable.   Linking  intellectual  capital  assets to  the  high‐tech export could be helpful to find the sources of the high level of exports in this sector...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} differences in functional and effective brain connectivity between persons who stutter (PWS) and typically developing (TD) fluent speakers, and to assess whether those differences can serve as biomarkers to distinguish PWS from TD controls. We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in 44 PWS and 50 TD controls. We then used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) together with Hierarchical Partner Matching (HPM) to identify networks of robust, functionally connected brain regions that were highly reproducible across participants, and we assessed whether connectivity differed significantly across diagnostic groups. We then used Granger Causality (GC) to study the causal interactions (effective connectivity) between the regions that ICA and HPM identified. Finally, we used a kernel support vector machine to assess how well these measures of functional connectivity and granger causality discriminate PWS from TD controls. Functional connectivity was stronger in PWS compared with TD controls in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortices, but weaker in inferior frontal cortex (IFG, Broca's area), caudate, putamen, and thalamus. Additionally, causal influences were significantly weaker in PWS from the IFG to SMA, and from the basal ganglia to IFG through the thalamus, compared to TD controls. <b>ICA</b> and GC <b>indices</b> together yielded an accuracy of 92. 7 % in classifying PWS from TD controls. Our findings suggest the presence of dysfunctional circuits that support speech planning and timing cues for the initiation and execution of motor sequences in PWS. Our high accuracy of classification further suggests that these aberrant brain features may serve as robust biomarkers for PWS...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The {{severity}} of coronary artery narrowing is a poor predictor of functional significance, in particular in intermediate coronary lesions (30 - 70 % diameter narrowing). The aim of this work was to compare {{the performance of a}} quantitative hyperaemic myocardial blood flow (MBF) index derived from adenosine dynamic computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging with that of visual CT coronary angiography (CTCA) and semi-automatic quantitative CT (QCT) in the detection of functionally significant coronary lesions in patients with stable chest pain. METHODS AND RESULTS: CTCA and CTP were performed in 80 patients (210 analysable coronary vessels) referred to invasive coronary angiography (<b>ICA).</b> The MBF <b>index</b> (mL/ 100 mL/min) was computed using a model-based parametric deconvolution method. The diagnostic performance of the MBF index in detecting functionally significant coronary lesions was compared with visual CTCA and QCT. Coronary lesions with invasive fractional flow reserve of ≤ 0. 75 were defined as functionally significant. The optimal cut-off value of the MBF index to detect functionally significant coronary lesions was 78 mL/ 100 mL/min. On a vessel-territory level, the MBF index had a larger area under the curve (0. 95; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 0. 92 - 0. 98) compared with visual CTCA (0. 85; 95 % CI: 0. 79 - 0. 91) and QCT (0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 84 - 0. 93) (both P-values < 0. 001). In the analysis restricted to intermediate coronary lesions, the specificity of visual CTCA (69 %) and QCT (77 %) could be improved by the subsequent use of the MBF index (89 %). CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-principle study, the MBF index performed better than visual CTCA and QCT in the identification of functionally significant coronary lesions. The MBF index had additional value beyond CTCA anatomy in intermediate coronary lesions. This may have a potential to support patient management...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{improvements}} {{rooted in the}} skills and resources of the direct beneficiaries is a strategic tool for development given level of commitment, independence and the local empowerment, especially in regions where people face serious problems such as drought. Being a recurring phenomenon of high economic and social impacts and wide geographic coverage in the State of CearÃ, it becomes a challenge both political and academic to find solutions to mitigate the damage and increase the capacity to take benefit from the opportunities that arise; revealing the {{need to understand how}} people exposed to this phenomenon adapt to live as best as possible within the constraints in terms of available resources, in other words, understand the Adaptive Capacity of people exposed to this situation. Thus, the objective of this work was to investigate the Adaptive Capacity level of rural communities inserted in the Areas Susceptible to Desertification (ASDs) of State of CearÃ. The Adaptive Capacity <b>Index</b> (<b>ICA)</b> resulted from the aggregation of four capitals (Social, Human, Natural and Economic) weighted according to their importance defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) {{based on the results of}} the Delphi methodology. Between the four capitals that constitute the Adaptive Capacity of rural communities in relation to droughts in the ASDs of the State of CearÃ, the Social Capital is the best that communities have and Human Capital is the weakest component. It is concluded that the rural communities of ASDs of the State of CearÃ have an average level of Adaptive Capacity in relation to droughts and Human Capital is the most critical determinant of it. A busca das melhorias enraizada nas habilidades e recursos dos beneficiÃrios diretos constitui uma ferramenta estratÃgica para promover o desenvolvimento dado nÃvel de comprometimento, a independÃncia e o empoderamento local, principalmente nas regiÃes onde se deparam graves problemas como as secas. Sendo um fenÃmeno recorrente, de altos impactos econÃmicos e sociais e de grande abrangÃncia no Estado do CearÃ, torna-se um desafio tanto polÃtico quanto acadÃmico encontrar soluÃÃes que mitiguem os danos causados e aumentem a capacidade de aproveitamento das oportunidades que surgem; revelando a necessidade de entender a forma como os sujeitos sociais expostos a esse fenÃmeno se adaptam para conviver da melhor forma possÃvel dentro das limitaÃÃes em termos de recursos disponÃveis, em outras palavras, compreender a Capacidade Adaptativa das pessoas expostas a essa situaÃÃo. Assim, objetivou-se neste trabalho investigar o nÃvel de Capacidade Adaptativa das comunidades rurais inseridas nas Ãreas SusceptÃveis Ã DesertificaÃÃo (ASDs) no Estado do CearÃ. O Ãndice de Capacidade Adaptativa (ICA) resultou da agregaÃÃo dos Ãndices de quatro capitais (Social, Humano, Natural e EconÃmico) ponderados de acordo com suas importÃncias definidas pelo mÃtodo de AnÃlise HierÃrquica do Processo (AHP) baseado nos resultados obtidos da metodologia Delphi. Dos quatro capitais que constituem a Capacidade Adaptativa das comunidades rurais em relaÃÃo Ãs secas nas ASDs do Estado do CearÃ, o Capital Social Ã o que as comunidades apresentam maior avanÃo e o Capital Humano Ã o mais fraco dos componentes. Conclui-se que as comunidades rurais das ASDs do Estado do CearÃ possuem um nÃvel mÃdio da Capacidade Adaptativa em relaÃÃo Ãs secas e o Capital Humano Ã o determinante mais critico da mesm...|$|R
