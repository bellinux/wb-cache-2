50|$|The {{expansion}} {{associated with}} the Third <b>Interchange</b> <b>Circuit</b> will be built by Chinese contractors.|$|E
50|$|An <b>interchange</b> <b>circuit</b> {{can carry}} {{many types of}} signals and provide many types of service features, such as control signals, timing signals, and common return functions.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, an <b>interchange</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{a circuit}} that {{facilitates}} {{the exchange of}} data and signaling information between data terminal equipment (DTE) and data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE).|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} <b>interchange</b> <b>circuits</b> ("signals" [...] or [...] "leads") between the DCE and DTE are defined in TIA-530: Category I, which uses the {{balanced}} characteristics of EIA-422, and Category II, {{which is the}} unbalanced EIA-423. Most of the <b>interchange</b> <b>circuits</b> are Category I, {{with the exception of}} Local Loopback (pin 18), Remote Loopback (pin 21), and Test Mode (pin 25) being Category II.|$|R
5000|$|TIA-530 {{originally}} used Category I circuits {{for what}} is commonly called [...] "Data Set Ready" [...] (DCE Ready, pins 6 and 22) and [...] "Data Terminal Ready" [...] (DTE Ready, pins 20 and 23). Revision A [...] changed these <b>interchange</b> <b>circuits</b> to Category II (para 4.3.6 and 4.3.7 of the standard) and added a [...] "Ring Indicator" [...] on pin 22. Pin 23 is grounded in TIA-530-A.|$|R
50|$|SMs have Dual Link Interface (DLI) {{cards to}} connect them by {{multi-mode}} optical fibers to the Communications Modules for time-divided switching to other SMs. These links may be short, for example {{within the same}} building, or may connect to SMs in remote locations. Calls among the lines and trunks of a particular SM needn't go through CM, and an SM located remotely can act as distributed switching, administered from the central AM. Each SM has two Module Controller/Time Slot <b>Interchange</b> (MCTSI) <b>circuits</b> for redundancy.|$|R
50|$|In data transmission, it is a {{secondary}} channel {{in which the}} direction of transmission is constrained to be opposite {{to that of the}} primary, i.e., the forward (user-information) channel. The direction of transmission in the backward channel is restricted by the control <b>interchange</b> <b>circuit</b> that controls the direction of transmission in the primary channel.|$|E
50|$|A lot of today's {{electronic}} game products have chipsets with keys, {{that make it}} difficult or impossible to <b>interchange</b> the integrated <b>circuits</b> in the device, in order to repair it, or to carry out certain interface or applications. Some people do get around the keys, but it is quite an involved process. There is quite a good counterculture scene however, and {{there are quite a}} few people who do this.|$|R
40|$|System {{frequency}} {{is vital}} part for power system balance. As per India Electricity Grid code frequency {{should be in}} the range of 49. 5  Hz– 50. 5  Hz. Deviation from above mentioned range is charged as Unscheduled Interchange (UI) charge. This paper proposes a new method for load and frequency control based on control of third parameter of three-part Availability Based Tariff (ABT) i. e. Unscheduled <b>Interchange</b> charges. New <b>circuit</b> is designed considering prioritization of load and using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) under Smart Grid environment...|$|R
5000|$|Casuarina is a {{base for}} one of three {{interchanges}} for the Darwin bus service which is located at Casuarina Square, just below Woolworths. From here, travellers can ride buses directly to the Darwin or Palmerston <b>interchanges,</b> or on <b>circuits</b> which service the surrounding suburbs {{before returning to the}} Casuarina interchange. [...] In late 2010, Vice President of The Northern Territory Transport Authority, David Rivett, authorised the introduction of the [...] "Orbital Link" [...] bus routes, that serve as express bus services to the Darwin and Palmerston bus interchanges. These services only run on weekdays and are intended to alleviate common travel difficulties encountered by those travelling to work and school in the peak hours of the day.|$|R
40|$|The modern {{philosophy}} {{for constructing}} fast, globally convergent algorithms is to combine a simple globally convergent algorithm with a fast, locally convergent algorithm {{to form a}} hybrid. The work in this paper involves exploring and implementing hybrid {{solutions to the problem}} of circuit partitioning in VLSI physical design. Results obtained indicate that the generated solutions and running time of a combined Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm are superior to results obtained from Simulated Annealing and Iterative Improvement methods based on module <b>interchange.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Circuit</b> partitioning is the task of dividing a circuit into two or more smaller parts. Given a VLSI netlist, the circuit partitioning attempts to divide the circuit into k parts of specified sizes so as to minimize the number of signal nets that interconnect components in the k partitions. Partitioning can be used directly to divide a circuit into portions that are implemented on separate physical components, s [...] ...|$|R
