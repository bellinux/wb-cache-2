500|$|The {{race was}} {{described}} afterwards as [...] "an incredibly boring race" [...] by Cycling Weekly. Valverde, however, {{said that it}} was [...] "dangerous", with all the crashes happening {{at the front of the}} peloton, and that it was [...] "the most nervous race <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> doing". The 2015 race was his third victory in La Flèche Wallonne, bringing him level with Eddy Merckx; Valverde described this as a [...] "great honour". His aim after the race was to win a third victory at the Liège–Bastogne–Liège, which he succeeded in doing.|$|E
500|$|Julian {{began to}} see his father more regularly. Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973, and {{encouraged}} Julian's interest in music by showing him some chords. [...] "Dad and I got on a great deal better then," [...] recalls Julian. [...] "We {{had a lot of}} fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear—they were the happiest time <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> with them." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this stage}} Darwin had an acute {{interest}} in island biogeography, and {{his description of}} St Helena as [...] "a little centre of creation" [...] in his geological diary reflects Charles Lyell's speculation in Volume 2 of Principles of Geology that the island would have acted as a [...] "focus of creative force". He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but [...] "as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind". When organising his Ornithological Notes between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird Mimus thenca: ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with Goldmine magazine, bassist John Taylor {{admitted that he}} was struggling with his drug addictions during recording of the album. He said, [...] "When we were in rehearsal, it seemed like {{we had a great}} album, but we weren't able to parlay it into a great album in the studio, whatever. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just <b>remember</b> smoking hash oil, that's all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really <b>remember</b> about making that album." ...|$|R
500|$|A Game Boy Color {{version of}} Jet Force Gemini was in {{development}} in 2000, but was ultimately cancelled. The {{owner of the}} prototype cartridge has attested that the game appears to be nearly complete, though it was never officially announced by either Rare or Nintendo. In an October 2012 interview, former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley commented: [...] "Jet Force Gemini on the Gameboy was the only occasion <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> Rare outsourcing anything. It was being done by Bits Studios and was nearly done last time I saw it, I’m not sure what happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1931, Two Guns White Calf, son of {{the last}} Blackfoot tribal chief, was capitalizing off his {{claim to be the}} model for the coin. To try {{to put an end to}} the claim, Fraser wrote that he had used three Indians for the piece, {{including}} [...] "Iron Tail, the best Indian head <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> The other one was Two Moons, the other I cannot recall." [...] In 1938, Fraser stated that the three Indians had been [...] "Iron Tail, a Sioux, Big Tree, a Kiowa, and Two Moons, a Cheyenne". [...] Despite the sculptor's efforts, he (and the Mint) continued to receive inquiries about the identity of the Indian model until his 1953 death.|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{what it feels like to}} be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E

500|$|Writing about The Year of the Sex Olympics in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith {{felt that}} Kneale {{was one of}} the few {{television}} writers whose work was particularly memorable. Once upon a time, Lord Hailsham, proceeding to the chamber of the House in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as Lord High Chancellor, spotted a friend and cried lustily, [...] "Neil!" [...] They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last night... last year... last century? Quite. Curiously, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> clearly the first time I saw The Year of the Sex Olympics by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.|$|E
500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican {{for as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> having an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out in opposition to the monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back now I see that it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E

500|$|... "Jugband Blues" [...] {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as [...] "Vegetable Man". Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] it is {{directed}} towards those around him. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. He told them he wanted them to simply [...] "play whatever they want" [...] regardless {{of the rest of the}} group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used. About The Salvation Army, band manager Andrew King said that Barrett [...] "wanted a massive Salvation Army freak-out, but that's the only time <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> Norman [...] putting his foot down." [...] The song features a distinctive three-tiered structure: starting off in 3/4 meter, then into 2/4 and finishing off in 4/4.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green {{said that she}} was pleased with the {{continuity}} seen in [...] "Rajiin" [...] but felt that the female sexuality seen in this episode was the [...] "most gratuitous... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> on Trek". She thought that the Rajiin character was a cliché, calling her a [...] "trained slut who comes on to everyone around her". Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as [...] "". However, he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books, saying that [...] "There's nothing really wrong with that. Nothing great about it either." [...] He gave it a score of 2.5/4.|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E

500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|In April, Farmer played {{shooting}} guard for the North {{team in the}} Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, [...] " [...] been a dream of mine as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> Even before kindergarten, I always wanted to play for Kentucky." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{a mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Miracle at St. Anna received some praise. Eric D. Snider, writing for Film.com praised the film, writing, [...] "This {{is beyond the}} scope of anything Lee has done before, and he rises to the challenge remarkably well, with battle scenes nearly as visceral and jolting as those in Saving Private Ryan and a multi-layered story involving the U.S. Army, the Nazis, and the Italian resistance movement." [...] Snider criticized the film's frame story, which he described as [...] "unnecessary and definitely corny." [...] James Verniere of the Boston Herald awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and a [...] "classic American WWII movie that both acknowledges the rousing tradition of such war epics as The Longest Day (1962) and The Big Red One (1980) and adds something new: paying tribute to the World War II African-American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, criticized the editing but praised the film overall, describing it as [...] "epic" [...] with [...] "one of the best battle scenes <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> on par with Saving Private Ryan...Miracle at St. Anna contains richness, anger, history, sentiment, fantasy, reality, violence and life. Maybe too much. Better than too little." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Crete in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before {{taking part in the}} fighting around Canea. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: [...] "...I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards [...] away. He was my first sure kill... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo... just as remote." [...] As the Allies began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.|$|E
