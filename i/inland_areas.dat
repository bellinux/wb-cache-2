Plymouth, located 75miles (120km) {{from where the}} hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95mph (155km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, {{with only a few}} locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02inches (153mm) in Havelock. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with a location in Craven County reporting a storm tide of 10.5feet (3.2m) above normal.|$|E
5|$|Bilis {{made its}} first {{landfall}} in northern Taiwan on July 13, with an intensity of 55kt (100km/h, 65mph). After moving across northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} tropical depression until July 17. Despite becoming a remnant low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to <b>inland</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than <b>inland</b> <b>areas.</b> Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine).

5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the Somaliland Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration {{was seeking to}} restore British control over the <b>inland</b> <b>areas</b> of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and make his way home. For his services in Africa, he {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Companion of the Bath, and promoted to brevet Colonel.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote <b>inland</b> <b>areas</b> and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E

In 1989, Asam Paya Oilfield was discovered in Sarawak <b>inland</b> <b>areas.</b> In 2010, Petronas discovered two oil fields offshore between Bintulu and Miri. In 2011, new underground reserves {{of oil and gas}} deposits were discovered by Nippon Oil in an inland region near Miri, Sarawak.|$|E
40|$|Most severe {{storms that}} occur over the Ishikari Plain are {{concentrated}} in a specific area: the eastern suburb of Sapporo and the central area of the Ishikari Plain. To analyze the structure and mechanism of a convective cloud system which devel-oped over the Ishikari Plain, Hokkaido, we investigated a severe storm which developed on September 23, 1988 using {{the results of the}} Doppler radar observation, ground and upper meteorological data, and three-dimensional numerical simulations using the moist cloud model developed by Y oshizaki and Ogura (1988). The results of the Doppler radar observation show that this convective cloud system propagated from the seaside <b>area</b> to the <b>inland</b> <b>area</b> over the Ishikari Plain. The convective cloud system was organized as a line oriented north-south propagating from the seaside <b>area</b> to the <b>inland</b> <b>area.</b> The orientation of the system upon reaching the <b>inland</b> <b>area</b> changed to southwest-northeast.

25|$|Burnett {{returned}} to Great Britain {{at the start}} of 1935 to take up command of the RAF's <b>Inland</b> <b>Area.</b> At the start of 1936, whilst Burnett was Air Officer Commanding <b>Inland</b> <b>Area,</b> he was promoted to air marshal and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the New Year Honours list. Later that year the RAF's command structure underwent a major reorganization. One of the changes was the redesignation of <b>Inland</b> <b>Area</b> as Training Command and Burnett became the command's first Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief. The next three years placed great demands upon Burnett and his command; as the threat from the German Luftwaffe increased, Training Command {{played a key role in}} the expansion of the RAF.|$|R

5|$|On 21November, a cyclone watch {{was raised}} for coastal and nearby <b>inland</b> <b>areas</b> of Western Australia between Wyndham and Beagle Bay. This watch was soon {{expanded}} to encompass areas {{east to the}} Western Australia–Northern Territory border and west to the Mitchell Plateau. Additionally, areas from Mitchell Plateau to Cockatoo Island were placed under a cyclone warning. The following day, watches extended to Cape Hotham Light in the Northern Territory, including the city of Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. As the cyclone intensified, warnings gradually spread eastward. Warnings reached as far east as Point Stuart prior to Alessia's landfall. All watches and warnings were dropped on 24November as Alessia moved inland and degraded to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some <b>inland</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but they occur with greater frequency in the <b>inland</b> <b>areas,</b> particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California. In spring and summer, they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime. In the Northeast, storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida.|$|E

Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services ranging from mass tourism to catering and various niche markets, the most significant being nautical tourism, as there are numerous marinas with more than 16thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. <b>Inland</b> <b>areas</b> offer mountain resorts, agrotourism and spas.
