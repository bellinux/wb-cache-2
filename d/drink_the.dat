5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports <b>drink,</b> <b>the</b> taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drink</b> mixers are <b>the</b> non-alcoholic {{ingredients}} in mixed drinks and cocktails. There {{are many reasons}} mixers are used.

Some mixers change the texture or consistency of <b>the</b> <b>drink,</b> making it thicker or more watery. Drink mixers may also be used strictly for decorative purposes by changing the color or appearance of <b>the</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|R
