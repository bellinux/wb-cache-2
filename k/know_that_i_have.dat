500|$|The {{record is}} {{separated}} into three sections: [...] "The Heirophant", [...] "Inauguration of the Worm", and [...] "Disintegrator Rising". In the final section, the central character transforms into the Antichrist Superstar: an epicurean demagogue whose motivations transcend any conceivable sense of morality. Nihilistic and disgusted by humankind, it initiates a genocidal extermination {{of the human}} race, eventually destroying the entire planet. The album is also cyclical, with both its opening and closing seconds consisting of the distorted phrase [...] "When you are suffering, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> betrayed you".|$|E

500|$|On June 21, 2005, {{the day of}} {{the release}} of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page {{advertisements}} in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. [...] "For a year now", Corgan wrote, [...] "I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

2500|$|Known in Romanian {{press as}} War of the palaces (...) was a {{prolonged}} conflict between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta, {{the representatives of}} Cotroceni Palace and Victoria Palace, respectively. In April 2014, conflict between the two has deepened and escalated to threats of imprisonment from both of them. President Traian Băsescu said that if Victor Ponta will try to interfere in the justice risks ending {{up in the hands}} of prosecutors, who will not tolerate that. He also stated that Ponta is deeply corrupt, and his election as president would be a great drama for Romania. In reply, Victor Ponta stated: „(...)

2500|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always {{considered}} that {{literature and the}} arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th.

2500|$|For Yeats she was, like Maud Gonne, {{a poetic}} muse, whose {{resonate}} voice {{was perfect for}} reciting his poetry. He found in her [...] "a tranquil beauty like that of Demeter's image near the British Museum reading-room door, and an incomparable sense of rhythm and a beautiful voice, the seeming natural expression of the image." [...] In his review of A Sicilian Idyll, Yeats wrote, [...] "Mrs. Edward Emery (Florence Farr) …won universal praise with her striking beauty and subtle gesture and fine delivery of the verse. Indeed her acting was the feature of the whole performance that struck one most, after the verse itself. I do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> any word too strong to express my admiration for its grace and power…I have never heard verse better spoken." [...] Both men wrote leading parts in their plays for Farr, who used her influence with Annie Horniman to have them produced.|$|E

There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the second}} round of talks, a day before Croitoru's nomination, Băsescu noted: [...] "Some parties have {{proposed}} Klaus Iohannis. I would like you to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not rejected the possibility for him to become Prime Minister in the condition that my options would be directed towards other [...] solutions. But I have rejected such a proposal because it comes from PSD or another party [...] ", referring to his alleged constraint to consider a proposal of the largest party (PDL), constraint disputed by the other parties. The opposition criticized the President for not designating Iohannis. Social Democrat leader Mircea Geoană accused Băsescu of trying to influence the upcoming presidential elections by having them organised by a sympathetic government. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President. Three days later, on 18 October Geoană suggested Antonescu was trying to use Iohannis as an [...] "electoral agent" [...] for Antonescu's bid for president. In response, Antonescu told the press that Iohannis [...] "is not the type of person that would let himself being used". Geoană and PSD leadership has held a second meeting with Iohannis in Bucharest in the evening of 18 October. UDMR, which the previous day announced it would also attend, declared in the morning that all their leaders are not in the city. PNL was present at the meeting by lower level representatives, after Antonescu announced in the morning he is on campaign in Cluj-Napoca. On 21 October the Parliament adopted with 252 votes for (of PSD, PNL, UDMR and minorities groups) and 2 against a declaration requesting the President to nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister.|$|E
