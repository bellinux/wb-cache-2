5|$|By his own account, in {{the late}} 1950s, while living in San Francisco, young John A. Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer; he pleaded to a lesser charge of <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> peace. While in the Army (1960–1962) he faced court-martial, {{on more than one}} occasion, for shoplifting. After he became an {{established}} actor and had changed his name to David, he was arrested, in 1967, for possession of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E

5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> sleeping residents.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both the injunction and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{an incident}} {{occurred at the}} Gotta Go convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths, including Bailey. Law enforcement reported that their accounts contradicted each other. Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, {{as they left the}} convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They said they wrestled the gun away from him and fled the scene. Bailey was charged with <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> peace, second-degree robbery, and theft of a firearm.|$|E
5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E

This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can generally be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled wobbegong has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E

5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, <b>disturbing</b> <b>the</b> other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when}} she enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked {{unconscious}} during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
