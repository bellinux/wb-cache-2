Andrew explained the name change in an interview for www.drivenfaroff.com:"Sometimes we just feel like playing a show near home and not announcing it as a TREOS show, just keeping it small and intimate and stuff. And you know, when you {{play a lot of}} shows {{you have to worry about}} your draw, and a lot of bands will purposefully not play their hometown area for a long time to build up a draw. It’s something that every band needs to be conscious of. And for us, we got to thinking, “We haven’t played a show in Massachusetts for a long time, kind of purposefully “we need to give ourselves a break and not saturate the market so people don’t care about seeing us anymore,” you know? And it got to the point where like, “Man, we miss playing hall shows and stuff. Let’s just do one,” and we talked to Alex from Therefore I Am because we love those guys and love playing with them, and worked it out. He set up the show and it just worked out great. People have caught on and every time they see The Red Eye of Soromon they’re obviously <b>going</b> <b>to</b> know it’s us, but it’s just something to do to be fun, you know, just be goofy about it, show people that we don’t take ourselves too seriously and that we still love playing shows like this. Playing big shows is great, playing big clubs is great, but it loses something at that level, you know? And it’s not as intimate and off-the-cuff and random as shows like these, and we love doing <b>it,</b> so we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> doing <b>it</b> as long as we’re a band, regardless of how well or how poorly the band does from here on out."

It's not a case of him being apart from the players - we're all together. He's a n individual, a bit crazy, but in a good way, He brings a lot of positivity into training, and it's great for us as players to have a coach like that. We always knew what we could do. We have a very strong team ethic. It's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be easy, because the other teams know us now. But we have to stick to our values; scoring goals, pushing forward instead of sitting back. We're always <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> attacking. <b>It's</b> not a good way to play, Above all, in football, you have to score goals, take risks. If you lose playing like that, at least you've given everything you can. Ian Holloway wants us to pass the ball, and his vision of how football should be played is the same as mine. He's been very important for me. I'm lucky to have fallen into working under a coach like him. He's been very important for me. I'm lucky to have fallen into working under a coach like him. Bulgaria wasn't easy but it was something I needed - to go far away, to be open to new ideas and it did me good. I was able to concentrate on my football away from France.

It doesn’t matter that Dale doesn’t have enough confirmation for his suspicions to freak out to the degree he freaks out, or that the result of his apparent over-reaction is to make him look like the dangerous one, instead of Shane. What matters to the writers is getting the scene in place, justified or not." [...] New York Starlee Kine wondered [...] "what the hell is Dale is talking about when he asks Shane, “Do you think these are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> us safe?” <b>It’s</b> not like he caught his mom smoking and is hiding her cigarette stash for her own good."
