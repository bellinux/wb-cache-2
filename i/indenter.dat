25|$|Rockwell {{hardness}} test – using a diamond cone <b>indenter.</b>|$|E
25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the <b>indenter,</b> {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E

This proves to be useful when measuring the hardness of practical surfaces.

5000|$|The {{off-side}} rule (blocks {{determined by}} <b>indenting)</b> {{can be implemented}} in the lexer, as in Python, where increasing the <b>indenting</b> results in the lexer emitting an <b>INDENT</b> token, and decreasing the <b>indenting</b> results in the lexer emitting a DEDENT token. These tokens correspond to the opening brace [...] and closing brace [...] in languages that use braces for blocks, and means that the phrase grammar {{does not depend on}} whether braces or <b>indenting</b> are used. This requires that the lexer hold state, namely the current <b>indent</b> level, and thus can detect changes in <b>indenting</b> when this changes, and thus the lexical grammar is not context-free: INDENT-DEDENT depend on the contextual information of prior <b>indent</b> level.|$|R

This was done to help to increase to low TV ratings during the past 4 years. On January 15, 2016, the original 2014 <b>indents</b> were replaced by 2015 <b>indents,</b> however on March 3, 2017 the 2015 <b>indents</b> were replaced by the 2016 <b>indents,</b> but were eventually replace with the [...] "rick and morty" [...] <b>indents</b> starting on July 8.

50|$|Meyer's law {{is often}} used to relate {{hardness}} values {{based on the fact that}} if the weight is halved and the diameter of the <b>indenter</b> is quartered. For instance, the hardness value for a test load of 3000 kg and a 10 mm <b>indenter</b> is the same for a test load of 750 kg and a 5 mm diameter <b>indenter.</b> This relationship isn't perfect, but its percent error is relatively small.|$|E

40|$|Medication {{turnaround}} time {{is defined as}} the interval from the time a medication order is written (manually or electronically) to the time the medication was administered. Monitoring medication {{turnaround time}} in inpatient settings allows organization to measure the impact of their efficiency of patient care. Objective: To trace the delays in the order and delivery system of In-patient pharmacy and check the average total time consumed in delivering drugs and medical consumables to the patients. Method: A time motion study was done in the in- patient pharmacy at a multi specialty hospital in Jaipur. A sample size of 300 <b>indents</b> was taken by using nonprobability convenient sampling method. Out of 300 <b>indents,</b> 56. 6 % were normal <b>indents,</b> 26. 6 % were new admission <b>indents</b> and 16. 6 % were urgent <b>indents.</b> Both primary and secondary data has been used in the study. The secondary data was obtained from the track care software, which was used in the pharmacy. SPSS and Microsoft excel was used for data analysis. Results: The study found that 25. 2 % of the normal <b>indents,</b> 48. 7 % of the new admission <b>indents</b> and 60 % of the urgent <b>indents</b> were delayed. In addition, the average time taken to deliver normal <b>indent</b> was found to be 1 hour 8 minutes, for new admission <b>indent</b> it was 48 mins and for urgent <b>indent</b> it was 1 hr 20 minutes i. e. more than the normal <b>indent</b> and new admission <b>indent.</b> It was also found that the peak hours of the <b>indent</b> order were 10 : 00 pm to 12 : 00 am, also the peak hours of <b>indent</b> order and the availability of work force at that time was contradicting. The average number of <b>indents</b> per day was found to be 1224. Conclusion: Through this study, we were able to identify various points of delays, which were occurring in delivering <b>indents</b> to the patients. The results of the stud...|$|R
