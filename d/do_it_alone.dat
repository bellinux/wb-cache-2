25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Regina conjures up a potion with Arthur watching, {{telling her that}} David {{explained}} everything, then Regina gave Arthur the mushroom. Arthur hesitates and says its best to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone,</b> and adds that Merlin only delivered prophecies when he was alone with him. David then tells everyone to step aside so he can be alone, but after Arthur tosses the Crown into the fire instead the cauldron, he tells them the spell did not work.|$|E
25|$|Stringham {{opposed the}} plan to block the inlets from the beginning. He {{believed}} that the tidal currents would either sweep the impediments away or would rapidly scour new channels. As he saw it, the Rebels could not be denied access to the sounds unless the inlets were actually held by the Union. In other words, {{in order to establish}} an effective blockade in this part of North Carolina, the forts that the state had set up would have to be captured. Since the Navy could not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone,</b> the cooperation of the Army would be needed.|$|E
500|$|Redding and Mitchell {{were not}} {{included}} in the process because Chandler felt that it was more efficient for him and Hendrix to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone.</b> To get a better quality recording, Chandler took the four-track tape recorded at De Lane Lea to Olympic Studios for overdubbing (although Hendrix had worked with eight-track recording in the US, it was not yet available in the UK). At Olympic, they were assigned Eddie Kramer, who, as a sound engineer, played an important role in subsequent Hendrix recordings. Hendrix added new vocals and guitar parts between February 3 and 8, 1967. [...] Unlike the conventional techniques used by the Experience to record previous songs, Chandler decided to try out new effects and sounds for [...] "Purple Haze". He enhanced background sounds (some contributed by Redding) by playing them back through headphones, which were moved around the recording microphone, creating [...] "a weird echo". Chandler also used sped-up guitar parts recorded at half-speed (which also raises the pitch) and panning to create novel effects. The guitar solo features the first use of the Octavia guitar effects unit. [...] Acoustical and electronics engineer Roger Mayer developed the unit with input from Hendrix. The Octavia doubles the frequency of the sound it is fed, essentially adding an upper octave.|$|E

50|$|According to Theodoret, the consecration of Evagrius by Paulinus {{was against}} canon law, because he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone,</b> in his death bed. Nonetheless, he was {{accepted}} by the emperor and thus the schism persisted.|$|R
50|$|Reasons {{for wanting}} a solo home birth include: wanting a natural process, {{going through a}} {{polluted}} period, and increased self-confidence <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone.</b> The idea of self-confidence and not needing anybody else is most strongly prevalent among multiparous women, having already <b>done</b> <b>it</b> previously without any help.|$|R
2500|$|Wilson's bandmates {{and father}} Murry resented {{that he was}} singled out as a [...] "genius". A 1971 article by Nolan {{reflected}} that at a certain point, the group's scene was not [...] "happening" [...] anymore, and that Wilson [...] "made it very clear" [...] to then-business partner David Anderle [...] "that it {{was always going to}} be the Beach Boys, that Brian wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>alone.</b> God knows he could have ... But the Beach Boys ... his family." [...] Mike Love recalls: [...] "As far as I was concerned, Brian was a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian's music machine ... This frustrated all of us but infuriated [...] Carl ... It didn’t feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian’s coattails." [...] In a 1966 article that asks [...] "Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?" [...] Carl rejected the notion, explaining that every member of the group contributes ideas, although Brian was most responsible for their music. Bruce Johnston remembers: [...] "we wanted to be a band again. The whole [...] thing had wiped everyone out, and we wanted to play together again." [...] Dennis Wilson stated: [...] "Brian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything." ...|$|E

In order to increase co-operation between Estonian ICT companies, the ITL created the Estonian ICT Demo Center, which would be focused on introducing Estonian ICT solutions to foreigners and also to create an organization where different companies could share their export experiences.|$|R
