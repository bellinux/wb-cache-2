The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

Besides, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> continue to help you, great trouble will befall you.

Over thirty years, Flagler had invested about $50 million in railroad, home and hotel construction {{and had made}} donations to suffering farmers after the freeze in 1894.

Either I have been the most wild, rash, unfaithful servant to the Crown and to England, or he has abandoned in the most shameful manner his friend, and his friend's character, for pursuing generally a system of measures that has been the perpetual theme of his conversation, and the subject of his recommendation for years back. It is painful, a trying task to submit to a separation from a man I have loved so long and so much; but I must submit to it, for I will not abandon my character to the disgraceful imputations that must attach upon it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> justify it by charging him with the most shameful dereliction of his friend that ever was experienced by a faithful and a tried one.|$|E
2500|$|Medwin {{rebelled against}} his father's wish that he become a lawyer, causing a quarrel, {{the result of}} which was Thomas' {{omission}} from his father's will, executed in 1829. There {{was a period of}} drift in Medwin's life, in which he attempted to live beyond his means as a gentleman. Considerable debts appear to have been paid by his family. These activities involved much carousing and gambling at his club in Brighton and generally spending money on collecting art. Shelley recalled Medwin as painting well and [...] "remarkable, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> mistake, for a particular taste in, and knowledge of the belli arti – Italy is the place for you, the very place – the Paradise of Exiles... If you will be glad to see an old friend, who will be glad to see you... come to Italy." [...] Medwin's financial situation could not continue as it was, and by 1812 he had accepted a military commission in the 24th Light Dragoons, a regiment where he could pursue his social pretensions.|$|E
2500|$|When he returned, {{ready to}} marry, {{the death of}} Rafael de Valenzuela, {{successor}} to José Millán Astray as commander of the Spanish Legion, intervened. Franco was offered Valenzuela's command, and promotion {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel. His ambition was too great to resist the opportunity, and he left for Morocco on 18 July 1923, making this promise to his fiancée: [...] "This year we will be married, above all else. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> die in combat, I will return to you." [...] Having become Spain's most decorated soldier, Franco was eventually given a leave of forty days, and royal permission to marry. The wedding took place on 16 October/22 October 1923, in the church of San Juan el Real of Oviedo. Franco's best man was King Alfonso XIII, represented by General Antonio Losada, military governor of Asturias. Serving as maid of honour was Isabel Polo, Carmen's aunt. The witnesses were the Marquis de la Vega de Anzo, and Franco's brothers, Nicolás and Ramón. Franco did not invite his father, Nicolás Franco, whom he had never forgiven for leaving his mother and living in Madrid with another woman.|$|E

2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared it myself. I haven't tried it myself when I heard that you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
