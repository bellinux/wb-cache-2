40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of measurements conducted at the VELA- 2 laboratories of the JRC in February 2007. The aim of the experimental campaign was to provide the necessary experimental data to model aerosol processes from the vehicle¿s exhaust tailpipe to the sampling point at the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The measurements included particle and temperature profiles at the tailpipe, {{at the end of}} the exhaust gas transfer tube to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda), at the diaphragm of the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> 1, 5 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm and 10 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm (normal sampling point). Two steady state speeds were used (50 and 120 km/h) and flow rates at the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> of 6 and 12 m 3 /min. Non-volatile and total particle number and mass concentrations were measured according to the protocol of the Particulate Measurement Programme. The results showed that the main changes of particle number distributions are observed along the transfer tube from the tailpipe to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda). Afterwards the particle number distributions remain almost constant. However, low dilution at the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (flow rate of 6 m 3 /min) leads to a further small particle number distribution change. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} ways of {{measuring}} particle emission from wood combustion. Firstly, particles can be sampled directly in the chimney. Secondly, a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> can be used, thus cooling the flue gases parallel to diluting. The purpose of this work is to investigate the differences between both measurements and establish {{which is the best}} method to measure particle emission from wood combustion. The approach is to perform particle emission measurements in the chimney and in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> simultaneously during the combustion of wood in a small-scale appliance. Moreover, Flame Ionization Analysis will be carried out to understand the contribution of condensed organic compounds to the total particulate matter emission. The particle emission measured in the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was between 5 and 12 times higher than in the chimney. The more unfavourable combustion conditions, the larger the difference between both measurements was seen. The results also show a factor of about 2, 5 between both particle emission measured in the stack and Total Hydrocarbon content in the flue gas and particle emission measured in the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> indicating that about 35 % of the hydrocarbons measured in the stack with the Flame Ionization Detector condense along the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> accounting for approximately 85 % of the total particle emission found at this location. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline {{port fuel injection}} engines have not been fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel injection engines relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel injection engines analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel injection engines. A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel injection engines for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The performance of the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{introduced}} a limit for non-volatile particle number (PN) emissions > 23 nm from light-duty vehicles and the stated {{intent is to}} implement similar legislation for on-road heavy-duty engines at the next legislative stage. This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order 5 % and higher scatter of the results could easily {{be explained by the}} effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e. g. the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30 %. These high variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments and drifts of the PN systems (especially those of the Particle Number Counters - PNCs) over time. Correlation measurements between the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnels</b> (Constant Volume Samplers - CVS) and the proportional Partial Flow Dilution Systems (PFDS) showed agreement within 15 % for the PN method down to 1 x 1011 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based Particulate (matter) Mass (PM) and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1 - 2 mg/km for light-duty vehicles and also 2 - 3 mg/kWh for heavy-duty applications. The correlation improves when only elemental carbon mass is considered: It is relatively good down to 0. 1 - 0. 3 mg/km or mg/kWh; one order of magnitude below the PM levels. JRC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a wind tunnel study of near-field pollutant dispersion from rooftop emissions of two multiple building configurations. The configurations mainly consisted of an emitting building {{in the presence of}} an upstream and a downstream building. The various parameters that were varied include: stack height (hs), stack location (Xs), spacing between upstream and emitting building (S 1), spacing between downstream and emitting building (S 2) and exhaust momentum ratio (M). Gas concentrations were measured at various building surfaces using a gas chromatograph. The wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>dilutions</b> were also compared to ASHRAE, 2007 and 2011 models. Results show that a taller upstream and a taller downstream building inhibit the plume from dispersing, thereby increasing the pollutant concentrations {{on the roof of the}} emitting building and leeward wall of the upstream building. In general, the spacing between the upstream and emitting buildings, besides the heights of each building were found to be critical parameters influencing the plume characteristics. ASHRAE, 2007 predictions were found to be overly conservative for the isolated building, while ASHRAE, 2011 estimates compared well with experimental data for a few cases. Safe placement of stack and intake on various building surfaces to avoid plume re-ingestion are suggested based on this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} {{rates for}} 221 vapor-phase, semivolatile, and particle-phase organic compounds from motor vehicles plus fine particulate matter mass and some inorganic particle-phase species are calculated based on measurements made {{inside and outside}} a Los Angeles roadway tunnel in 1993. These emission rates are calculated based on fuel consumption to remove any uncertainties based on <b>tunnel</b> <b>dilution</b> rates or air circulation. The results show carbon monoxide emissions rates of 130 g L^(- 1) of gasoline-equivalent fuel burned and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of 9. 1 g L^(- 1). These values are higher than predicted by the baseline version of California's EMFAC 7 G emissions inventory program but are within the coemission rate range of 108 ± 25 g L^(- 1) reported by roadside remote sensing studies in Los Angeles [Singer, B. C.; Harley, R. A. J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc. 1996, 46, 581 − 593]. When the VOC emissions composition in the tunnel is {{compared to that of}} tailpipe emissions source test data and to the composition of additional unburned whole gasoline, the tunnel atmosphere is found to be consistent with a linear combination of these major contributors over a fairly broad range of about 74 − 97 % vehicle exhaust depending on the tailpipe profiles used. Fine particulate emissions within the tunnel consist largely of carbonaceous material accompanied by a significant amount of ammonium nitrate apparently formed by gas-to-particle conversion processes within the tunnel atmosphere. Certain gas-phase and particulate organic compounds traditionally thought to be the secondary products of atmospheric chemical reactions are enriched inside the tunnel, and from this enrichment, the primary emission rates of aromatic alcohols, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, and aromatic polycarboxylic acids are calculated. Data on petroleum biomarkers emissions rates in the tunnel can be used in the future to estimate primary vehicle exhaust fine particulate matter concentrations in the urban atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|With the {{promulgation}} {{of the new}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 2. 5 in 1997, {{the measurement}} of fine particulate matter from stationary sources becomes more important. A series of tests have been performed on three different natural and refinery gas-fired sources using traditional manual methods (in-stack cyclones and filter with iced-impinger train) and <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> sampling. The <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> mixes stack emissions with cleaned ambient air, cooling and diluting them to simulate {{what happens in the}} plume as emissions leave the stack. This type of sampling allows for extensive speciation of the PM 2. 5 fraction including elements, ions, organic and elemental carbon, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). One result of particular interest is the low percentage of organic carbon (OC) accounted for by the SVOC results. At all locations, the sum of the SVOCs was less than 10 percent of the total OC measured using the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> sampling is able to provide a more complete speciation of SVOCs, however this large discrepancy indicates that further investigation is needed. Differences in organic aerosol emissions from natural gas versus refinery gas combustion have also been observed. Results from these tests not only allow comparison of traditional manual methods to dilution sampling, but also allow comparison to ambient sampling results and utilization of data in atmospheric models, such as chemical mass balance models...|$|E
40|$|An {{appropriate}} type of <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> is chosen, {{based on}} the international standards, user's needs and the manufacturer's requirements. During the design process, a number of restrictions specified in the standards for emission and Venturis were taken into account. The data required to address basic concepts were obtained from numerous emission tests performed at the IMR Institute. A short algorithm of calculation of the critical flow Venturi (CFV) is also presented. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the problems of the measurement of particulate emissions using the dilution method, which does not allow us to use the unique thermodynamic and flow parameters. A method of evaluation of particulate emissions for two extreme cases which were expected during the tests was adopted. Using the results of calculations, a full flow <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> with CFV was manufactured and tested at the IMR Institute...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of Phase II evaluation of Particle Number (PN) Portable Measurement Systems (PEMS). 8 PN-PEMS were compared with legislation compliant PN systems connected to the tailpipe and the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (CVS). In total 7 Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI), 3 Port Fuel Injection (PFI), 2 Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) equipped vehicle, 1 moped and 3 motorcycles were tested with > 130 test cycles. The results confirmed the findings of Phase I: Diffusion Charging (DC) based systems are a feasible option to measure PN and thermal pre-treatment is necessary to avoid volatile artefacts. At least two of the DC based PN-PEMS showed good agreement with the reference PMP system (# 1, # 3). A third one (# 4) also had very good behaviour, but higher scatter. The best performing PN-PEMS had differences from the reference instrument at the tailpipe within - 25 % and + 30 % with a scatter of 20 % [...] The differences from the reference system at the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> were within - 35 % and + 50 % (scatter 25 %) (including all technologies tested); slightly higher due to the particle transformation processes that take place between the tailpipe and the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> exhaust flow accuracy and time alignment. It was also shown that a well calibrated PN-PEMS can cover a wide range of engine technologies with similar differences to the reference system. Based on the experimental data new PN-PEMS efficiencies were recommended for the technical requirements. The CPC based PN-PEMS had issues (prototypes). However, one CPC based PN-PEMS, which arrived late in the program, had behaviour equivalent to the reference systems and better real time comparability with the reference systems compared to the DC based systems. Further evaluation of the system after the campaign with another 10 vehicles confirmed these findings. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full flow and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full flow, partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the full flow <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full flow and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|JRC {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} using PN-PEMS systems for Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) applications. The main evaluation phase took place between February and June 2016. One Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicle and three vehicles equipped Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) and Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction (SCR) were tested. The key conclusion of the evaluation phase is that PN-PEMS testing for HDV is feasible. However, low ambient temperatures were challenging for the instruments regarding their robustness. Re-testing of the commercial instruments in September with a DPF and SCR equipped vehicle showed {{that most of the}} issues were resolved. The PN-PEMS instruments measurement uncertainty is around 30 % at the moment.

40|$|We study, {{experimentally}} and theoretically, {{the dynamics}} of non-volatile particles emitted from a diesel EURO 3 light-duty vehicle along the transfer tube that conducts exhaust fumes from the tailpipe to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Particle agglomeration, diffusional and thermophoretic transport are modeled. For turbulent, but moderate, Reynolds numbers and under steady-state conditions we map the combustion-generated nanoparticle dynamics onto an one-dimensional dynamics of aerosol particles in an ageing chamber. The aggregate fractal dimension, determined self-consistently by comparing mass distributions, varied from 2 to 2. 3. The relative importance of aerosol processes is estimated by defining appropriate characteristic time scales. Agglomeration and convection by the bulk motion of the fluid are the dominant processes for inlet number concentrations {{of the order of}} 1. 0 e 8 particles/cm 3 and transfer-tube lengths of 6 - 9 m.

40|$|The fractal {{nature of}} diesel exhaust {{aggregates}} has profound implications on their transport and thermal properties. However, {{the measurement of}} the fractal dimension requires sophisticated techniques (see, e. g., Van Gulijk C. et al. (2004) that are not easily available. We propose an algorithm for the self-consistent determination of the average fractal dimension of non-volatile solid particles emitted by light-duty diesel vehicles (Isella et al., 2008). Experimental number distributions are taken from vehicle emission measurements performed at the VELA- 2 laboratories of the Joint Research Centre.

40|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulates}} are {{the subject}} of increasingly severe legislation controlling mass emissions throughout the world. Other emissions, which are currently unregulated, are also receiving closer scrutiny. In particular, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), some of which are known carcinogens, are being studied. A total exhaust solvent scrubbing apparatus (TESSA) has been constructed to sample diesel exhaust hydrocarbons, using a solvent mixture to strip organic compounds from exhaust gases. This avoided adsorption of hydrocarbons onto particulates, when fitted close to the exhaust port, and minimised the formation of sampling artifacts. TESSA yielded new information, enabling lighter more volatile organics such as 2 - and 3 -ringed PAC to be characterised, these could not be collected by a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> filter, which trapped particulates effectively but did not sample the hydrocarbons which had remained in the gas-phase. TESSA has proved itself to be uniquely suitable for the sampling of gaseous hydrocarbons with which there is currently an increased interest. Experiments using TESSA have confirmed that there is a contribution to the exhaust from small amounts of fuel passing through the combustion chamber substantially unchanged, as well as from partially burnt or pyrolysed products of combustion. New techniques have been developed to aid the interpretation of data obtained from high resolution gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in order to assess the origin of specific groups of compounds within the highly complex samples obtained from diesel exhaust. Naphthalene and phenanthrene were shown to increase their concentration relative to their alkylated derivatives in an exhaust sample when compared to the relative concentrations found in the fuel. These parent compounds were being formed within the combustion chamber, as well as surviving in unburnt fuel. Nitro-PAC were detected only at considerably lower concentrations than had previously been found on <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> filter samples. Two new methods for assessing the contribution of lubricating oil to diesel exhaust emissions have been developed, and involved matching common peaks in a sample and a lubricating oil standard. The results demonstrated that lubricating oil makes a significant contribution to the total particulates. Increased control of lubricating oil leakage to the exhaust would help to reduce particulate emissions to below the new stringent limits. Perkins Engineering, Peterboroug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) {{and their}} oxygenated {{derivatives}} occur in particles {{or in the}} vapour phase in the atmosphere. Some of these compounds, particularly the PAH, are known as strong carcinogens and/or mutagens. Emissions from diesel engines are {{an important source of}} these contaminants in urban air. In this work, the chemical composition of diesel particles was studied from two different perspectives: the gaz/particule partitioning and the different size fractions of these compounds. A <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> with a diesel car connected, was built {{for the purpose of this}} study. Measurements were carried out near a motorway in Paris for comparison to the tunnel test results. The results show, firstly, that the gaseous phase of the PAH is predominant (up to 20 times) with respect to the particulate phase, and that the PAH and their derivatives are mainly adsorbed in the very fine particulate fraction (for particle size under 0. 4 urn).

Each bus drove along a residential route simulating stops, with windows closed or open. Particulate matter (PM) and its constituents were monitored in the bus and from a LV. We collected source samples from the tailpipe and crankcase emissions using an on-board <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Concentrations of PM(1), ultrafine particle counts, elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC) were higher on the bus than the LV. The DT method estimated that the tailpipe and the crankcase emissions contributed 1. 1 and 6. 8 mug/m(3) of PM(2. 5) inside the bus, respectively, with significantly higher crankcase self pollution (SP) when windows were closed. Approximately two-thirds of in-cabin PM(2. 5) originated from background sources. Using the LV approach, SP estimates from the EC and the active personal DataRAM (pDR) measurements correlated well with the DT estimates for tailpipe and crankcase emissions, respectively, although both measurements need further calibration for accurate quantification. CMB results overestimated SP from the DT method but confirmed crankcase emissions as the major SP source.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to quantify the emissions from heavy-duty vehicles operating on alternative fuels or advanced fuel blends, often with novel engine technology or aftertreatment. In {{the first year of}} the program West Virginia University (WVU) researchers determined that a transportable chassis dynamometer emissions measurement approach was required so that fleets of trucks and buses did not need to be ferried across the nation to a fixed facility. A Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory (Translab) was designed, constructed and verified. This laboratory consisted of a chassis dynamometer semi-trailer and an analytic trailer housing a full scale exhaust <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and sampling system which mimicked closely the system described in the Code of Federal Regulations for engine certification. The Translab was first used to quantify emissions from natural gas and methanol fueled transit buses, and a second Translab unit was constructed to satisfy research demand. Subsequent emissions measurement was performed on trucks and buses using ethanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuel, and biodiesel. A medium-duty chassis dynamometer was also designed and constructed to facilitate research on delivery vehicles in the 10, 000 to 20, 000 lb range. The Translab participated in major programs to evaluate low-sulfur diesel in conjunction with passively regenerating exhaust particulate filtration technology, and substantial reductions in particulate matter were recorded. The researchers also participated in programs to evaluate emissions from advanced natural gas engines with closed loop feedback control. These natural gas engines showed substantially reduced levels of oxides of nitrogen. For all of the trucks and buses characterized, the levels of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and particulate matter were quantified, and in many cases non-regulated species such as aldehydes were also sampled. Particle size was also quantified during selected studies. A laboratory was established at WVU to provide for studies which supported and augmented the Translab research, and to provide for development of superior emissions measurement systems. This laboratory research focused on engine control and fuel sulfur issues. In recent years, as engine and aftertreatment technologies advanced, emissions levels were reduced such that they were at or below the Translab detectable limits, and in the same time frame the US Environmental Protection Agency required improved measurement methodologies for engine emissions certification. To remain current and relevant, the researchers designed a new Translab analytic system, housed in a container which can be transported on a semi-trailer. The new system's <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> flow was designed to use a subsonic venturi with closed loop control of blower speed, and the secondary dilution and particulate matter filter capture were designed to follow new EPA engine certification procedures. A further contribution of the program has been the development of techniques for creating heavy-duty vehicle test schedules, and the creation of schedules to mimic a variety of truck and bus vocations...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the raw exhaust, thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for raw exhaust measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for raw exhaust sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

Scooter exhaust was analyzed at the tailpipe, in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and partly {{collected in a}} mobile smog chamber for photochemical ageing. We present evidence that the photochemically aged exhaust from a 2 -stroke and a 4 -stroke scooter produces considerable amounts of secondary organic aerosol: from 1. 5 to 22. 0 mg/km, and from 5. 5 to 6. 6 mg/km, respectively. Tests were repeated after replacing the standard petrol and synthetic lube oil with an alkylate fuel (with low content of aromatic compounds) and ultra-clean lube oil (low ash forming potential). We observed emission reduction (with some exceptions) for several gaseous and particulate phase species, in particular for carbon monoxide (from 8 % up to 38 % and from 31 % to 50 %, for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooters, respectively), particulate mass (from 32 % up to 75 % for the 2 -stroke scooter), aromatic compounds (89 % and 97 % for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooter, respectively), and secondary organic aerosol (from 87 % to 100 % and 99 % for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooters, respectively). We attribute the organic aerosol reduction to the low content of aromatics in the alkylate fuel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Another distillate fuel produced catalytically from Fischer-Tropsch products originally derived from natural gas by Mossgas was also compared with 49 -state No. 2 diesel by characterizing emissions from Detroit Diesel 6 V- 92 powered transit buses, three of them equipped with catalytic converters and rebuilt engines, and three without. The CBD cycle was employed as the test schedule, with a test weight of 33, 050 lb. For those buses with catalytic converters and rebuilt engines, NO x was reduced by 8 % and PM was reduced by 31 % on average, while for those buses without, NO x was reduced by 5 % and PM was reduced by 20 % on average. It is concluded that advanced {{compression ignition}} fuels from non-petroleum sources can offer environmental advantages in typical line haul and city transit applications...|$|E
40|$|Testing {{was carried}} out on a Cummins N 14 single-cylinder {{heavy-duty}} D. I. diesel research engine with a full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> system to quantify lubricating oil consumption (LOC) rates and determine any effects of changes in LOC rates on the particulate matter. Varying oil consumption rates and their effect on particulates were analyzed at selected operation conditions of the CARB 8 -mode test cycle. The three steady-state engine operating conditions tested were mode 4 (1200 RPM, 25 % load), mode 5 (1200 RPM, 100 % load), and mode 1 (1800 RPM, 100 % load). Several engine alterations, consistent with the literature, for changing LOC rates were applied. The alterations consisted of installing an oil control ring with a unit pressure 50 % less than the standard value, removing the intake valve stem seals (VSS), removing the exhaust VSS, and removing all (intake and exhaust) VSS. Each of these alterations was tested individually to avoid causing interacting effects. LOC rates were successfully quantified by measuring the calcium concentration in the exhaust particulates. For the engine operating conditions tested, no major differences in detailed PM characteristics for changes in LOC rates were found except for organic carbon emissions at mode 5. In addition, very small changes in the particle size distribution for the lower unit pressure oil control ring were observed for modes 5 and 1 in the size range of 150 to 250 nanometers...|$|E
40|$|Regulated and {{unregulated}} {{emissions from}} a 2 -stroke and a 4 -stroke scooter were characterized during a legislative driving cycle in a certified laboratory. Scooter exhaust was analyzed at the tailpipe, in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and partly {{collected in a}} mobile smog chamber for photochemical aging. We present evidence that the photochemically aged exhaust from a 2 -stroke and a 4 -stroke scooter produces considerable amounts of secondary organic aerosol: from 1. 5 to 22. 0 mg/km, and from 5. 5 to 6. 6 mg/km, respectively. Tests were repeated after replacing the standard petrol and synthetic lube oil with an alkylate fuel (with low content of aromatic compounds) and ultra-clean lube oil (low ash forming potential). We observed emission reduction (with some exceptions) for several gaseous and particulate phase species, in particular for carbon monoxide (from 8 % up to 38 % and from 31 % to 50 %, for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooters, respectively), particulate mass (from 32 % up to 75 % for the 2 -stroke scooter), aromatic compounds (89 % and 97 % for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooter, respectively), and secondary organic aerosol (from 87 % to 100 % and 99 % for the 2 -stroke and the 4 -stroke scooters, respectively). We attribute the organic aerosol reduction to the low content of aromatics in the alkylate fuel. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|Logs {{of three}} common Southern and mid-European woods (Quercus pyrenaica, Populus nigra and Fagus sylvatica) were burned in two {{different}} combustion appliances, a fireplace and a stove. The flue gas composition was monitored continuously in the exhaust ducts of both burning appliances for total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon oxides (CO 2 and CO). Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter below 2. 5 mm (PM 2. 5) was sampled in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> under isokinetic conditions and chemically characterised for water soluble-inorganic ions, organic and elemental carbon and levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. The evolution of the emission factors of these components throughout the combustion cycle was studied. The fireplace was the combustion appliance with the highest CO, CO 2, THC and PM 2. 5 emission factors. The carbonaceous matter represented 72 e 84 % of the particulate mass emitted, regardless of species burned and combustion devices. OC/EC ratios were higher for the fireplace than for the stove, and showed a significant potential relation with Kþ/levoglucosan. The dominant water soluble inorganic ions in smoke particles were Kþ, PO 3 4, SO 2 4, and Naþ. Anhydrosugar emissions were strongly enhanced in the start-up phase, when lower temperatures are registered, and decreased progressively until the glowing combustion phase. However, Kþ emission seems to be higher in flaming-dominated combustion at higher temperature. Statistical analyses, including the KruskaleWallis test, principal component analysis and Pearson correlation between emission factors, were carried out. A significant correlation between NH 4 þ and levoglucosan was found for both appliances...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigations}} {{carried out in the}} context of this research project was to determine the influence of Diesel fuel quality on the particle concentration in the exhaust gas and particularly on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) deposited on these particles. The basis for all experiments and the discussion of the results of this research program was detailed fuel analysis. The particle concentration in the exhaust gas of the examined engine was determined gravimetrically by a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> system prescribed by the American environmental protection authority, the EPA, for such measurements. The results show that the effect of the fuel aromatic compound content on the exhaust gas composition of the engines is greatest if the ignition and combustion conditions are worst, ie: in the lower part load range at relatively low combustion space temperatures. (orig. /HW) Es war das Ziel der im Rahmen des vorgestellten Forschungsvorhabens durchgefuehrten Untersuchungen, den Einfluss der Dieselkraftstoffqualitaet auf die Partikelkonzentrationen im Abgas und insbesondere auf die an diese Partikel angelagerten polyzyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) zu ermitteln. Die Basis fuer alle Versuche und die Diskussion der Ergebnisse dieses Forschungsprogrammes war eine detaillierte Kraftstoffanalyse. Die Partikelkonzentrationen im Abgas des untersuchten Motors wurden gravimetrisch mit einem von der amerikanischen Umweltschutzbehoerde EPA fuer derartige Messungen vorgeschriebenen Verduennungstunnelsystem ermittelt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Einfluss des Kraftstoffaromatengehalts auf die Abgaszusammensetzung im Motor dann am groessten ist, wenn die Zuendungs- und Brennbedingungen am schlechtesten sind, naemlich im unteren Teillastbereich be relativ niedrigen Brennraumtemperaturen.

40|$|Launceston, a {{city with}} a {{population}} of approximately 80, 000 located in the north of Tasmania, Australia, regularly experiences high levels of air pollution during winter. Ambient `PM_(10) ` (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 micrometres) levels exceed the Australian 24 -hour guideline of ` 50 ` `μg"/"m^ 3 ` around 20 - 40 times during the May to September period each year. This is generally attributed to residential woodburning, with approximately one third of households using woodheaters or open fireplaces. This thesis reports on investigations into characterising and quantifying the contribution of woodsmoke to wintertime air pollution in Launceston. An historical record of air quality in Launceston was reconstructed using polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as surrogates for air pollution in a dated sediment core taken from the upper Tamar Estuary. The overall depth profile showed that levels of PAHs began increasing {{at the end of the}} 19 th century and have been relatively steady since the 1930 s. Pyrogenic source ratios similar to woodburning were found in both atmospheric and sedimentary samples, although quantification of the woodburning contribution was not possible using PAHs alone. Factors affecting atmospheric sampling of PAHs were investigated, including the impact of sampling rate, the vapour-particle phase distribution on various components of the sampling system and degradation caused by different filter media. Because of the inability of PAHs to differentiate between fossil fuel and wood combustion there was a need to identify alternative tracers for wood combustion. A <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was used to collect emissions from woodheaters operated with different airflow settings, and around 100 organic compounds were quantified. Although the majority of compounds were not detected in ambient air samples, levoglucosan was found to be not degraded in the atmospheric samples and was identified as a consistent tracer for woodsmoke. Levoglucosan concentrations in ambient `PM_(10) ` indicated that woodheaters contributed about 80...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2010. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: David B. Kittelson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF);vii, 56 pages; appendices A-D. A {{diesel particulate filter}} (DPF) {{can be used to}} reduce the particulate matter (PM) emissions from a vehicle. However, when these devices fail the tailpipe emissions can change. The main goal of this project was to determine if a soot sensor provided by Honeywell could detect a failed filter, defined as an exhaust aerosol concentration downstream of the DPF greater than the current US heavy duty PM standard of 13 mg/kWh (10 mg/bhp-hr). In this study a DPF failure was first simulated on an engine dynamometer test stand using an exhaust bypass valve. Then the valve was removed and the filter was actually failed in a series of steps by drilling out individual channel end caps. Exhaust was cooled and diluted using a partial flow air ejector <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and dilution ratios were determined using raw and dilute nitric oxide (NO) measurements. Dilute diesel exhaust aerosol was characterized upstream and downstream of a DPF. Filter samples and an AVL photo-acoustic soot sensor were used to estimate PM mass emissions, and TSI aerosol instruments were used to measure aerosol size distributions and total number concentrations. An electrostatic precipitator, DMA, electrometer and CPC were used to evaluate the aerosol charge distribution. Downstream measurements were repeated as the filter was progressively failed in a series of steps. These measurements were then used to evaluate the response of the Honeywell exhaust soot sensor. Under certain steady state conditions the sensor output showed a statistically significant increase as the filter was failed but the output was susceptible to interference from mechanical vibration and was dependent on engine operating conditions, and the exhaust system used. Exhaust aerosol charge measurements showed the concept is viable but further work is required to refine the sensor...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIncentives to use {{biofuels}} {{may result}} in increasing vehicular emissions of compounds detrimental to air quality. Therefore, regulated and unregulated emissions from a Euro 5 a flex-fuel vehicle, tested using E 85 and E 75 blends (gasoline containing 85 % and 75 % of ethanol (vol/vol), respectively), were investigated at 22 and - 7 degrees C over the New European Driving Cycle, at the Vehicle Emission Laboratory at the European Commission Joint Research Centre Ispra, Italy. Vehicle exhaust was comprehensively analyzed at the tailpipe and in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A fraction of the exhaust was injected into a mobile smog chamber to study the photochemical aging of the mixture. We found that emissions from a flex-fuel vehicle, fueled by E 85 and E 75, led to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, despite the low aromatic content of these fuel blends. Emissions of regulated and unregulated compounds, as well as emissions of black carbon (BC) and primary organic aerosol (MA) and SOA formation were higher at - 7 degrees C. The flex-fuel unregulated emissions, mainly composed of ethanol and acetaldehyde, resulted in very high ozone formation potential and SOA, especially at low temperature (860 mg O- 3 km(- 1) and up to 38 mg C kg(- 1)). After an OH exposure of 10 x 10 (6) cm(- 3) h, SOA mass was, on average, 3 times larger than total primary particle mass emissions (BC + POA) with a high O:C ratio (up to 0. 7 and 0. 5 at 22 and - 7 degrees C, respectively) typical of highly oxidized mixtures. Furthermore, high resolution organic mass spectra showed high 44 / 43 ratios (ratio of the ions m/z 44 and m/z 43) characteristic of low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol. We also hypothesize that SOA formation from vehicular emissions {{could be due to}} oxidation products of ethanol and acetaldehyde, both short-chain oxygenated VOCs, e. g. methylglyoxal and acetic acid, and not only from aromatic compounds.

40|$|Field testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) is {{becoming}} an important regulatory tool to monitor the in-use compliance of large sources like heavy-duty vehicles, construction and agriculture equipment. Legislative research programmes in Europe, United States and Japan are introducing PEMS in the regulations. The current development status of instrumentation and test procedures is mature for gaseous emissions. The most critical issue remains the development of portable PM instruments and the associated protocol. The main objectives of the paper are: To {{provide an overview of}} the on-going regulatory efforts regarding on-board PM measurements both in the European Union and the United States; To review the available portable measurement techniques; To discuss the technical issues related to the development of an official ¿on-board test procedure¿. The discussion and the conclusions will be supported by some findings from the EU-PEMS project and in particular the evaluation of portable instruments under controlled laboratory conditions (i. e. on reference test cycles) and against reference instruments. PM mass measurements were carried out from a Euro III heavy-duty engine. For the filter gravimetric method, the Control Sistem micro-PSS (portable proportional diluter) was compared to the standard gravimetric methods using full dilution within the CVS <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and two laboratory proportional flow sampling systems such as the AVL Smart Sampler (SPC 472) and the Control Sistem PSS- 20. For real-time measurement, the AVL 483 micro soot sensor was also tested in parallel with the gravimetric methods using both full flow and partial flow dilution. The measurements were found to be highly repeatable over the regulatory cycles. Bio-fuel was also used to characterise the instruments in different ranges and its effect upon the black carbon concentration observed. Regarding the development of on-board test procedures, the first findings from tests conducted on city buses will be presented. The main issues related to a less controlled on-board environment (with vibrations, temperature changes) compared to more controlled laboratory conditions will be highlighted. JRC.
