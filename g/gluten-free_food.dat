5000|$|The first {{reference}} to ancient grains {{as a health}} food was in Daily News (New York) in 1996. Since then the popularity of ancient grains as a food has increased, and in 2011 the <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> market was valued at $1.6 bn. In 2014, the American company General Mills launched a product containing [...] "ancient grains" [...] called [...] "Cheerios + Ancient Grains".|$|E
5000|$|He has {{conducted}} clinical trials aimed at clarifying the minimal amount of gluten needed {{to trigger the}} small intestinal damage in patients affected with celiac disease.

5000|$|Regulation of {{the label}} {{gluten-free}} varies by country. Most countries derive key provisions of their gluten-free labeling regulations from the Codex Alimentarius international standards for food labeling as a standard relating to the labeling of products as gluten-free.

40|$|Abstract The gluten {{analysis}} of foods {{has long had}} limitations, which have precluded food standards authorities from issuing standards for <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> based on final gluten content. The Codex Alimentarius and the Food and Drug Administration have taken steps towards such standards in which they favour the R 5 -enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for gluten analysis. If this method is to be widely employed, its limitations should be recognised. Above all, {{it should be noted}} the ability of R 5 -enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and other methods, to measure gluten's toxicity toward celiac disease patients is not validated clinically. Gluten is a complex mixture of proteins and its toxicity is not fully understood. Analytical methods are a valuable tool in the definition of <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods,</b> but they should be employed with appropriate caveats in ensuring the safety of the foods. </p...|$|R

40|$|Recently, gluten free foods have {{attracted}} much research interest {{motivated by the}} increasing market. Despite the motivation for developing <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> {{it is necessary to}} have a scientific basis for developing <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> and the tools for detecting the peptide sequence that could be immune-toxic to some persons. This review will be focused primarily on the cereal-based commodities available for developing gluten free blends, considering naturally gluten-free cereals in addition to oats, and recent transgenic approaches for developing cereals free of immunotoxic gluten. Secondly, the biochemical tools for mimicking gluten network viscoelastic properties will be presented. Finally, special emphasis will be put in compiling the available techniques for gluten detection and quantitation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|There is no general {{agreement}} on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products. The ELISA method was designed to detect w-gliadins, but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins. The use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> products. The European Union, World Health Organization, and Codex Alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins, gliadins rather than all-wheat proteins.|$|E
5000|$|NCGS {{has been}} a topic of popular interest. Gluten has been named [...] "the new diet villain". Gluten-free diets have become the latest diet craze and have been {{advocated}} and followed by many celebrities. Estimates suggest that 10%-20% of people in USA and Australia are consuming gluten-free foods. On the other hand, there is another school of thought that suggests that NCGS is largely imaginary and has been overestimated by patients and the <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> industry.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the cost and}} affordability of a <b>gluten-free</b> healthy <b>food</b> basket for four reference families in Australia. A secondary aim was to {{determine the}} price differential between commonly available <b>gluten-free</b> and gluten-containing <b>food</b> staples. Methods Exploratory study using an amalgamation of two commonly used food basket costing methods. Two food basket types were constructed for four common Australian family types. These were designated the Healthy Food Basket and modified (<b>gluten-free)</b> Healthy <b>Food</b> Basket. Baskets were priced at five locations and costs as a proportion of the Equivalised Household Disposable Income and average weekly earnings for welfare recipients were calculated. The price differential for four common bread and cereal staples were also calculated per 100 [*]g. Results The <b>gluten-free</b> healthy <b>food</b> basket was significantly more expensive compared to a gluten-containing healthy food basket for all family types. The gluten-free basket was considered unaffordable for three of the four common family types. Gluten-free staples are significantly more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. Conclusions Compliance to a gluten-free diet may be more difficult for some families due to the significant price discrepancy of gluten-free items. Families on welfare with people who require a gluten-free diet are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. Consideration should be given {{to the creation of a}} national subsidised medical foods program to enable equitable access to affordable <b>gluten-free</b> staple <b>foods</b> via prescription...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{treatments}} are touted for [...] "leaky gut syndrome", such as dietary supplements, probiotics, herbal remedies, <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods,</b> and low FODMAP, low sugar, or antifungal diets, {{but there is}} little evidence that the treatments offered are of benefit. None have been adequately tested to determine if they are safe and effective for this purpose. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend the use of special diets to manage the main symptoms of autism.|$|R

50|$|Banana {{pasta is}} a type of pasta {{prepared}} using banana as a primary ingredient. The product is typically made with unripe, green bananas that are dried and then milled into banana flour. Banana pasta is a <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food.</b> The product can be dried for later cooking or can be cooked immediately after preparation. Banana pasta is cooked like standard pasta, typically by boiling it. A study found that banana pasta has a higher water absorption rate compared to standard pasta, which generates higher yields after cooking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gluten-free}} diet includes naturally <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food,</b> such as meat, fish, seafood, eggs, {{milk and}} dairy products, nuts, legumes, fruit, vegetables, potatoes, pseudocereals (in particular amaranth, buckwheat, chia seed, quinoa), only certain cereal grains (corn, rice, sorghum), minor cereals (including fonio, Job's tears, millet, teff, called [...] "minor" [...] cereals {{as they are}} [...] "less common and are only grown in a few small regions of the world"), some other plant products (arrowroot, mesquite flour, sago, tapioca) and products made from these gluten-free foods.|$|E
50|$|A {{gluten-free}} diet {{should be}} mainly based on naturally <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> {{with a good}} balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and maize are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value.|$|R
40|$|Background: Celiac {{disease is}} a widely {{prevalent}} enteropathy caused by intolerance to gliadin, one of the gluten proteins. We developed two methods {{for the analysis of}} gliadin levels. Both methods use flow cytometry and rat antibodies against a 16 -residue peptide of gliadin. The peptide is common to the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins. Methods: in the one-site assay, the antigen (gliadin standard or food extract) was adsorbed on 3 -mum latex particles. Sensitized particles were then incubated, in this order, with rat anti-gliadin peptide antibodies and anti-rat immunoglobulin G antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. In the two-site assay, the antigen was trapped on the latex particles by rat anti-gliadin antibodies and then measured by the same antibodies labeled with fluorescein. Results: Detection limits were 1 ng/ml for the one-site assay and 10 pg/ml for the two-site assay. The two-site assay displayed gliadin at concentrations above the limit proposed by the Codex Alimentarius in 2 of 40 gluten-free products. Conclusion: There is a growing concern that gliadin, even when present in <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> within the limit fixed by the Codex Alimentarius, over the long term may become toxic to patients with celiac disease. The techniques described in this study provide an opportunity to further decrease the acceptable limit of gliadin in <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods.</b> (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{epidemic}} of gluten intolerance, there is growing interest in <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods.</b> Beyond just being <b>gluten-free,</b> such <b>foods</b> can have other positive nutritional benefits to human health. Extrusion processing is commonly used to produce {{a wide variety of}} human <b>food</b> products. <b>Gluten-free</b> grains can be a processing challenge, however, due to lack of proper binding, which can lead to poor quality food products. This research explores how extrusion parameters impacted the quality of amaranth- and quinoa-based extrudates. The specific objectives of this project included extruding each of the grains, then measuring extrudate properties, such as color, unit density, expansion ratio, and durability. Both the quinoa and amaranth were extruded as raw grain, as well as ground to 2 mm and 1 mm particle sizes. Other experimental conditions included moisture contents of 20 % and 40 % (d. b.), and extruder screw speeds of 50 rpm and 100 rpm. All treatments were successfully extruded, and all extrudates had high quality attributes, making this the first time either quinoa or amaranth was extruded without any binding ingredients...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to {{provide an overview of}} the topic Food for special nutrition, food for people with gluten intolerance. In the thesis, I focus on the labeling of <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> and its nutritional value in comparison with food containing gluten. Among the <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> we count those which contain more than 10 mg of gliadin per 100 g dry weight. The composition and labeling of <b>gluten-free</b> <b>food</b> is regulated by Commission Regulation (EC) 41 / 2009. Further, I focus on the origin of celiac disease, its development, symptoms and treatment. Celiac disease is caused by toxic effect of gluten particles, alpha gliadin.

50|$|Approximately {{one third}} of NCGS {{patients}} continue having symptoms despite gluten withdrawal. This {{may be due to}} diagnostic error, poor dietary compliance, or other reasons. Those afflicted with NCGS may be under the impression that they don't need to follow a strictly gluten free diet. However, the ingestion of even a small amount of gluten may cause more immediate symptoms in people suffering from NCGS as compared with those afflicted with coeliac disease. People with NCGS should carefully read ingredient labels on food and be aware of potential cross contamination as a source of gluten in otherwise <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods.</b> To find out if there are unintended ingestions of gluten, an exhaustive evaluation with the advice of a coeliac disease specialized dietitian could be necessary.|$|R
40|$|In genetically {{susceptible}} individuals the {{ingestion of}} gluten and related proteins triggers an immune-mediated enteropathy known as Coeliac Disease (CD). Recent epidemiological {{studies have shown}} that 1 in 100 people worldwide suffer from CD. Such a rate establishes CD {{as one of the most}} common food intolerances. Coeliac patients eating wheat or related proteins such as hordeins (barley) or secalins (rye) undergo an immunological response, localized in the small intestine, which destroys mature absorptive epithelial cells on the surface of the small intestine. Currently, the only way that CD can be treated is the total lifelong avoidance of gluten ingestion. Therefore, people that suffer from CD have to follow a very strict diet and avoid any products which contain wheat, rye or barley. Avoidance of these cereals leads to a recovery from the disease and significant improvement of the intestinal mucosa and its absorptive functions. Coeliac patients are not in position to eat some of the most common foods such as bread, pizzas, biscuits or drink beer and whiskey. Due to the unique properties of gluten, it is a big challenge for food scientists to produce good quality gluten free products. The Science of <b>Gluten-Free</b> <b>Foods</b> and Beverages covers the work presented at the First International Conference on Gluten-Free Cereal Products and Beverages. The area of <b>gluten-free</b> <b>foods</b> and beverages is becoming more and more important, since the number of people suffering from Coeliac Disease as well as people suffering from gluten allergies is rising.
