40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the geo electrical structure of the Chaves region (N E Portugal) is presented. The region is dominated by the Chaves Graben which is bounded by granitic and metamorphic schistose formations. The <b>geo</b> electric <b>feature</b> of the structures has been investigated in regional and local scales. The study of regional structures has been made from the magnetotelluric data set. Using a frequency range from 180 to 0. 01 Hz, the main <b>geo</b> electrical <b>features</b> of the upper and median crustal structures were determined. The principal aspects of such studies are: - dimensionality; -principal impedance azimuths; - 1 D and 2 D interpretations using the determinant of the M T impedance tensors and considering the superficial distortion. The main conclusions of the analysis are: - existence of two distinct directions, one N 70 deg C- 80 deg C related to deep faults and another (N-S) connected with the Chaves Verin fault. This tectonic accident has a N 35 deg C #+-# 5 E direction in the upper part and it seems almost N-S at some deep sectors. The deep fault system {{plays an important role in}} the geothermal system control, mainly in the water infiltration, circulation and ascension constraints, - predominance of 2 D structures, with a N 35 deg C #+-# 5 E direction, at the overburden, in the Graben zone and its neighbourhood. At its N E part, the superficial structures have a direction near N-SAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

40|$|Any {{model that}} {{attempts}} to describe the time evolution of planetary positions needs to account for retrograde motion, the apparent reversal of the planet's path {{against the background of}} the fixed stars. In discussing mod els ofthe cosmos through history, it is standard practice to present the Ptolemaic model. 1 This model, {{which was one of the}} first to successfully account for planetary motions in detail, has as its most notable <b>geo</b> metric <b>feature</b> the use of epicycles and deferent circles. 2 When present ed to students, it is sometimes diffi cult for them to envision how an epicycle and deferent combine to produce the characteristic backward motion. Textbook treatments 3 of the topic include the standard loop-the loop picture, which is inherently stat ic. We have developed a "hands-on" exercise, using simple supplies, which enables students to get a dynamic feel for planets executing epicyclical motion. This exercise has been used successfully by students in our "physics for poets " course and in an interdisciplinary, team-taugh...|$|R
40|$|The Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) fish {{assemblage}} {{over the}} last two millennia was examined using fish otoliths recovered from sediment cores. In Chapter 2, the hypothesis that otolith shape and elemental composition can be used to accurately discriminate between common southern California Current System fish taxa was tested. Digital images of 905 sagittal otoliths, representing 6 major taxonomic-based groups, were used to develop geometric (GEO) and elliptic Fourier (EF) shape measurements and a subset of 143 otoliths also analyzed for trace elements (ELM). Results indicate that random forest analysis was superior to discriminant function analysis and <b>GEO</b> <b>features</b> outperformed EF and ELM features for classification. Highest classification accuracy (96. 3 %) resulted from using the 10 strongest discriminatory features, which included a mixture of GEO, EF, and ELM features. In Chapter 3, fossil otoliths (n = 1188) recovered from 3 Kasten and one box core sampled in the SBB were classified to taxonomic group by expert opinion (EO) and, after measuring shape and elemental features, by using the classification models developed in Chapter 2. Results of the EO and feature-based classification methods agreed strongly for the most abundant taxa and indicated that Myctophidae (52. 7 %) and Bathylagidae (31. 5 %) have dominated the forage fish assemblage in the SBB {{over the last}} two millennia. Less abundant taxa include Merlucciidae (6. 9 %), Sebastidae (4. 8 %), and Engraulidae (3. 9 %). Taxa displayed similar periods of variability on the decadal (50 - 90 years) and century scale (200 +/- 50 years). In Chapter 4, the relation of climate and SBB fish assemblage was investigated by comparing the otolith deposition rate (ODR) record with proxies of climate over the same period. Results indicate coherence between the ODR of Myctophidae, Bathylagidae, Engraulidae, and Sebastidae, which display significant correlation with temperature-based climate indices. The coherent pattern in several fish populations and basin-wide climate variability observed over off the coast of Southern California demonstrate the role of climatic forcing in regulating forage fish populations over the past two millennia. Our results provide baseline composition data and an increase understanding of natural variability of SBB fish populations...|$|R
40|$|A {{fast and}} high-precision {{orientation}} algorithm for BeiDou is proposed by deeply analyzing the constellation characteristics of BeiDou and <b>GEO</b> satellites <b>features.</b> With {{the advantage of}} good east-west geometry, the baseline vector candidate values were solved by the GEO satellites observations combined with the dimensionality reduction theory at first. Then, we use the ambiguity function to judge the values {{in order to obtain}} the optical baseline vector and get the wide lane integer ambiguities. On this basis, the B 1 ambiguities were solved. Finally, the high-precision orientation was estimated by the determinating B 1 ambiguities. This new algorithm not only can improve the ill-condition of traditional algorithm, but also can reduce the ambiguity search region to a great extent, thus calculating the integer ambiguities in a single-epoch. The algorithm is simulated by the actual BeiDou ephemeris and the result shows that the method is efficient and fast for orientation. It is capable of very high single-epoch success rate(99. 31 %) and accurate attitude angle (the standard deviation of pitch and heading is respectively 0. 07 &# 176;and 0. 13 &# 176;) in a real time and dynamic environment...|$|R

40|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} {{internet}} access and location services provided by smartphone devices, the volume of queries issued by users to find products and services that are located near them is rapidly increasing. Local search engines help users in this task by matching queries with a predefined geographical connotation ("local queries") against a database of local business listings. Local search differs from traditional web-search because to correctly capture users&# 039; click behavior, the estimation of relevance between query and candidate results must be integrated with geographical signals, such as distance. The intuition is that users prefer businesses that are physically closer to them. However, this notion of closeness is likely to depend upon other factors, like the category of the business, {{the quality of the}} service provided, the density of businesses in the area of interest, etc. In this paper we perform an extensive analysis of online users&# 039; behavior and investigate the problem of estimating the click-through rate on local search (LCTR) by exploiting the combination of standard retrieval methods with a rich collection of <b>geo</b> and business-dependent <b>features.</b> We validate our approach on a large log collected from a real-world local search service.
