50|$|The common <b>dab</b> (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> is an edible {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish native to shallow seas around Northern Europe, in particular the North Sea, where it lives on sandy bottoms down to depths of about 100 m.

Higher maximum numbers (Nmax) occurred during daytime in all species with the most significant effect in flatfish, 18 in daytime and 5 at night-time. Bottom current had no significant effect on numbers of whiting, flatfish or haddock. The Nmax of hagfish was strongly related to current speed in a non-linear way with an increase in numbers up to 10 cm s- 1 and then decrease in Nmax at higher water speeds. Understanding and account-ing for such species-specific influences is important in the design of long term monitoring surveys using baited cameras...|$|R

From South West Patch (North Sea), 5 / 12 samples showed evidence of adducts with chromatographic properties on PEI-cellulose tic plates {{similar to those of}} adducts formed by aromatic carcinogens. Areas of radioactivity were also observed on chromatograms of 2 / 6 samples from Sylt I (North Sea). In contrast, 6 DNA samples from fish caught in the Channel showed no evidence of adducts. Liver DNA samples from sole (Solea sp.) from another site, Liverpool Bay, exhibited areas of radioactivity which were not evident in samples from a less-polluted area.

40|$|From December 1990 to December 1992 the {{multidisciplinary}} research project 'Fish diseases in the North Sea' {{has been carried}} out. The aim of this biological effect monitoring has been the registration of spatial distribution patterns of environmental pollution by different biological and chemical methods. Therefore <b>dabs</b> (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> L.) from 34 NSTF sampling sites and flounders (Platichthys flesus L.) from 7 estuaries have been investigated. The activity of hepatic mixed function monooxygenase (MFO), {{has been one of}} the investigated biological parameters. MFOs are of central importance in biotransformation of xenobiotics. MFO activity is a sensitive indicator and reflects exposure to chemical inducers. The main inducers are PCB and PAH. Because MFO activity can be related quantitatively to the extent of pollutant exposure, such studies of molecular effects can be used as a bioassay of the presence and effects of pollutants. Along the North Frisian coast high MFO activities were found. They increased from south to north and from offshore to nearshore stations. Furthermore there is strong evidence for very high contaminant levels near oil platforms in the Ekofisk oilfield. Dabs from British offshore stations had the highest MFO activities. Decreasing MFO activities from the Firth of Forth to the mouth of Humber indicated a decreasing pollution gradient. Most of the estuaries also showed typical pollution gradients. Flounders from the river Elbe estuary had the highest MFO activities which decreased from the inner to the outer estuary. In the river Schelde we measured peaks of MFO activity as high as in the river Elbe estuary. In female dabs MFO activity is about five times higher than in flounders. Furthermore their MFO activity showed a negative correlation with stage of gonadal development. Therefore males should be used as indicator organisms. (orig.)

At some UK offshore sites the prevalence of liver tumours in <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> (<b>dab)</b> exceeds 20 %. However, the molecular mechanisms of tumour formation and the causative agents are not known. The contribution of epigenetic mechanisms, although well-established in human tumourigenesis, is under-studied in tumours of aquatic species. In this thesis, alteration in the DNA methylation patterns in tumours of two fish species, the model species zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the un-sequenced marine flatfish dab, were investigated. The data presented provided a comprehensive characterisation of DNA methylation pattern in zebrafish liver and the first evidence of alterations in DNA methylation profiles of key genes in tumourigenesis pathways in any aquatic species. A statistically significant lower level of global DNA methylation was demonstrated in hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and non-cancerous surrounding liver tissue (ST) compared to liver of non-cancer bearing dab. The evidence presented in this thesis suggests that chronic exposure to a mixture of pollutants contribute to global DNA hypomethylation followed by further epigenetic and genomic changes, leading to the development of tumours in dab.

In {{this study we}} investigated the effects {{of changes in the}} infaunal community caused by an otter trawl fishery on the diet of two benthivorous flatfish species, <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> (<b>dab)</b> and Pleuronectes platessa (plaice). Samples of fish and infauna were collected from fifteen stations in an active fishing ground of Nephrops norvegicus in the NE Irish Sea, which is subject to a steep gradient of trawling frequency. Within the study area, otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on abundance, biomass and species richness of the infaunal community. The brittle star Amphiura filiformis and the phoronide species Phoronis sp., both vulnerable to the trawling, dominated the community at low levels of disturbance. Significant effects of the trawling frequency on fish diet were detected for plaice, but not for dab. Moving from low to high levels of disturbance, a significant increase in abundance of the infaunal prey species not affected by trawling in the stomach contents of plaice was detected. For dab, decreased abundance of the brittle star A. filiformis seemed to increase the potential to feed at intermediate levels of disturbance. Bottom trawls may therefore also indirectly affect the benthic communities, influencing the diet of demersal fish species. The results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling...|$|R

These results suggest an opportunistic utilization by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Also, two strategically different feeding habits could be distinguished between the five flatfish species.

The choice of this new dumping area was based on preliminary hydrodynamical and biological research.

No dominant species were found, and no important commercial fisheries or spawning and nursery grounds were located in the surrounding area.

40|$|The spring {{distribution}} of larval fish stages of flatfishes in the Dover Strait (eastern English Channel) was studied in 1995 and 1999. Fish larvae {{were identified and}} sorted according to developmental stages in order to study their ontogenic distribution. The French coastal waters are characterised by an unstable tide-dependent front, which influences larval dispersion. In spring, the French coastal waters have a high phytoplanktonic production. They have higher temperatures, lower salinities and differences in current intensity compared with the central English Channel waters. Generalised Additive Models (GAM) combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to model the potential habitats of life stages considering data from three major surveys in this area. The models were developed by coupling presence-absence models with non-null abundance models. The potential habitat of larval stages was then mapped using a geostatistical method (kriging). This revealed different species strategies in which young stages were abundant in central waters and older ones were distributed mainly along the French and Belgian coasts. It is concluded that the central English waters are important for young stages after hatching and that coastal waters are essential nurseries for future juveniles.
