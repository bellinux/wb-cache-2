For example, {{as a part of}} the flag it can be found in the office of Croat member of state presidency, as well as in many Croat-majority municipalities and schools in the country. Students’ report cards in secondary schools in Jajce have been marked with the coat of arms of <b>Herzeg-Bosna.</b> Herzeg-Bosnia's coat of arms is a part of the Croatian National Assembly's logo, while its variations are used by some Croat political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina (most notably, Croatian Party of Rights of Herzeg-Bosnia).|$|E

A joint criminal enterprise (JCE) existed and had as its ultimate goal the establishment of a Croatian territorial entity with part of the borders of the Croatian Banovina of 1939 to enable a reunification of the Croatian people. This Croatian territorial entity in BiH was either to be united with Croatia following the prospective dissolution of BiH, or become an independent state within BiH with direct ties to Croatia." [...] It found that Tuđman, Šušak, Boban, and others had [...] "joined, participated in and contributed to the JCE". Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti, the presiding judge in the trial, issued a separate opinion in which he contested the notion of a joint criminal enterprise. He characterized the war as a conflict of an internal nature between the Bosnian Croats and the Bosniaks and said that Tuđman's plans regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina were not in contradiction with the stance of the international community. On 19 July 2016, the Appeals Chamber determined [...] "that findings of criminal responsibility made in a case before the Tribunal are binding only on the accused in a specific case" [...] and concluded that the [...] "Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning Šušak's and Bobetko's participation in the JCE and did not find them guilty of any crimes." ...|$|E
