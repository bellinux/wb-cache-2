25|$|The south porch {{was built}} in 1637 and was {{designed}} by Nicholas Stone, master mason to Charles I. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from Dr Morgan Owen, chaplain to Archbishop Laud. It is highly ornate, with spiral columns supporting a curly pediment framing a shell niche with a statue of the Virgin and Child, underneath a gothic fan vault. The style {{was too close to}} Roman baroque for the puritans of the day and the porch itself was used as evidence in Laud's execution trial, citing its 'scandalous statue' to which one witness saw 'one bow and another pray'. The gate piers are original and the wrought iron gates are early 18th century. The bullet holes in the statue were made by Cromwellian troopers.|$|E

Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a story to tell Deke that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from the widow of an oil magnate.

500|$|Upon {{awakening}} {{the next}} morning, Cædmon remembered {{everything he had}} sung and added additional lines to his poem. He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the abbess, believed to be St Hilda of Whitby. The abbess and her counselors asked Cædmon about his vision and, satisfied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from God, gave him a new commission, this time for a poem based on [...] "a passage of sacred history or doctrine", {{by way of a}} test. When Cædmon returned the next morning with the requested poem, he was invited to take monastic vows. The abbess ordered her scholars to teach Cædmon sacred history and doctrine, which after a night of thought, Bede records, Cædmon would turn into the most beautiful verse. According to Bede, Cædmon was responsible for a large number of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics.|$|E

500|$|A {{treasury}} {{inventory of}} the Radziwiłł family's Nieśwież Castle (now Nesvizh in Belarus) made in 1740 includes {{a detailed description of}} a sword decorated with symbols of the Evangelists and inscriptions identical to those on Szczerbiec. According to the inventory, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from Crown Prince Jakub Sobieski to Prince Michał Radziwiłł, but the original source of the supposed replica was not given. An inventory made in 1738 of the treasure vault of the Sobieski family's Żółkiew Castle (now Zhovkva in Ukraine) mentions [...] "an estoc (koncerz) covered with golden plates bearing images of the Four Evangelists; Skanderbek's." [...] Based on this record, historian Aleksander Czołowski hypothesized that a replica of Szczerbiec was forged as early as 1457 and awarded to George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, the national leader of Albania, in recognition of his victory over the Ottoman forces (see Battle of Ujëbardha). After King John III Sobieski defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Albanians presumably returned the sword to him. His son, Jakub, possibly passed it on to Michał Radziwiłł as a present.|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Naomi sold a {{valuable}} painting to Paul {{in order to}} pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, [...] "Naomi says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift,</b> and belongs to her – but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner." [...] Polly and Naomi later ended up in a scrag fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had [...] "a great time". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he would forget the debt.
