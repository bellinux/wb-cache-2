Packets {{that at the moment}} of arrival cannot be relayed via their preferred routes (because those routes are busy) are deflected, i. e., relayed via suboptimal routes.

30|$|In [58], {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of IP over optical WDM networks is analyzed through an optical power-aware backbone network model. It is {{stated that the}} energy consumption of the IP over optical WDM networks can be reduced by bypassing the lightpath in the optical layer which causes {{a reduction in the}} number of IP router ports that consume maximum energy. In an energy-minimized design, the set of nodes corresponds to IP routers and optical switch nodes, and the link set symbolizes the physical fibers in the network. The proposed optimization model decreases energy dissipations in the network such as IP routers and WDM transponders to minimize overall network energy consumption. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed scheme consumes less power than the traffic grooming scheme when the lightpath bypass strategy is implemented. It is seen that the network size growth increases the power savings of the lightpath strategy because it provides longer lightpaths and allows bypassing of more <b>intermediate</b> <b>switch</b> nodes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Responding to the PIN {{cracking}} {{attacks from}} Berkman and Ostrovsky (FC 2007), we outline {{a simple solution}} called salted-PIN. A randomly generated salt value of adequate length (e. g. 128 -bit) is stored on a bank card in plaintext, and in an encrypted form at a verification facility under a bank-chosen salt key. Instead of sending the regular user PIN, salted-PIN requires an ATM to generate a Transport Final PIN from a user PIN, account number, and the salt value (stored on the bank card) through, e. g., a pseudo-random function. We explore different attacks on this solution, and propose three variants of salted-PIN that can protect against known attacks. Depending on the solution variation, attacks at a malicious <b>intermediate</b> <b>switch</b> now may only reveal the Transport Final PIN; both the user PIN and salt value remain {{beyond the reach of}} an attacker’s switch. Salted-PIN requires modifications to service points (e. g. ATM, point-of-sale), issuer/verification facilities, and bank cards; however, changes to intermediate switches are not required. ...|$|E

Wormhole networks therefore push at an extreme the networking paradigm of the Internet, adopting technical solutions for high-speed networking that are opposite to those taken in ATM. The aim {{of this paper is to}} perform a simulation-based comparison between the wormhole routing and ATM transport techniques in highspeed networking scenarios. The behavior of the two information transport techniques is studied in mesh topologies where a few interfering TCP connections in overload interact with a uniform background traf®c.

It is shown via simulation that the throughput performance of the two schemes is comparable (except for up/down routing). The authors also discuss the tradeoffs with respect to complexity of hardware, routing protocols and buffer requirements.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{end-to-end}} connection performance in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks {{is extremely important}} because its solution provides the information (such as end-to-end delay distribution and cell loss ratio) necessary for {{the definition of the}} Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for real-time connections. Due to the analytical complexities inherent in this problem, we are seeking to develop an efficient simulation technique for the fast production of results. The presented approach is a combination of an earlier time-parallel technique and probabilistic routing. An implementation of this technique on a multiprocessor with modest capabilities shows promising speed-up. Using the developed simulator, several experiments are conducted for the end-to-end behavior of ATM connections using bursty traffic models, including ones with active periods derived from heavy tailed distributions. An important feature of the study is that the interfering traffic is of the same type as the end-to-end traffic. Thus, no assumptions are made about traffic smoothing or approximations of the aggregate interference process by Poisson arrivals. The presented end-to-end performance results include the Cell Loss Ratio (CLR) and the delay distribution at the multiplexers and at each <b>intermediate</b> <b>switch</b> of the connection path. Among the presented findings, it is illustrated that if only few sources with heavy tailed active periods are multiplexed and if the utilizations are low, then the end result is not necessarily a worse performance as one would anticipate when larger aggregations of such sources asymptotically approximate a self-similar process. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract — To {{realize a}} path in an InfiniBand network, an address, known as Local IDentifier (LID) in the InfiniBand specification, must be {{assigned}} to the destination of the path and used in the forwarding tables of <b>intermediate</b> <b>switches</b> to direct the traffic following the path. Hence, routing in InfiniBand has two components: (1) computing all paths, and (2) assigning LIDs to destinations and using them in <b>intermediate</b> <b>switches</b> to realize the paths. We refer {{to the task of}} computing paths as path computation and the task of assigning LIDs as LID assignment. This paper focuses on the LID assignment component, whose major issue is to minimize the number of LIDs required to support a given set of paths. We prove that the problem of realizing a given set of paths with a minimum number of LIDs is NPcomplete, develop an integer linear programming formulation for this problem, design a number of heuristics that are effective and efficient in practical cases, and evaluate the performance of the heuristics through simulation. The experimental results indicate that the performance of our best performing heuristic is very close to optimal. We further demonstrate that by separating path computation from LID assignment and using the schemes that are known to achieve good performance for path computation and LID assignment separately, more effective routing schemes than existing ones can be developed.
