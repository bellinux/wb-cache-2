40|$|First, I {{would like}} to draw the reuse community's {{attention}} to somewhat "exotic" artefacts which are very useful but seem to be rather neglected in software reuse research. These are <b>general</b> <b>specification</b> notions (GSNs) and specification languages (SLs). By <b>general</b> <b>specification</b> notion I mean such mathematically precise notion that is not specific for any particular non-mathematical domain and is really used for describing things in various problem domains. Examples are finite automaton, decision table, various types of equations, production rules, etc. Second, I outline my approach to reuse of such artefacts. The main components of the approach are so called Practical Theory of Definitions and the Frege system. The former organizes GSNs and SLs for reuse. The latter is based on this theory and supports reuse of these artefacts.

40|$|Bank {{efficiency}} estimates often {{serve as}} a proxy of managerial skill since they quantify sub-optimal production choices. But such deviations can also be due to omitted systematic differences among banks. In this study, we {{examine the effects of}} heterogeneity on bank efficiency scores. We compare different specifications of a stochastic cost and alternative profit frontier model with a baseline specification. After conducting a specification test, we discuss heterogeneity effects on efficiency levels, ranks and the tails of the efficiency distribution. We find that heterogeneity controls influence both banks' optimal costs and profits and their ability to be efficient. Differences in efficiency scores are important for more than only methodological reasons. First, different ways of accounting for heterogeneity result in estimates of foregone profits and additional costs that are significantly different from what we infer from our <b>general</b> <b>specification.</b> Second, banks are significantly re-ranked when their efficiency is estimated with a specification other than the preferred, <b>general</b> <b>specification.</b> Third, the <b>general</b> <b>specification</b> gives the most reliable estimates of the probability of distress, although differences to the other specifications are low.

IBAL regulates interactions among graphical elements, such as geometric models and behavioral algorithms, to describe animated scenes. Interactions among graphical elements are managed by primitives which are arranged into three graphs. The three graphs logically partition an animation into "who," "what," and "when. " IBAL's unique design permits applications to represent, save, and restore {{a wide variety of}} complex scenes. A short summary of existing formats for scene modeling and scene animation is presented to distinguish and to assess the utility of IBAL's design.
