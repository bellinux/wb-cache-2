5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals <b>in</b> <b>entertainment</b> and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. <b>in</b> <b>entertainment</b> and commerce.

Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
