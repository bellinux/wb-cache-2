Conventional mining methods will be used for the shaft sinking phase of the ES project. The ES will be comprised of surface support facilities, a 1480 -ft-deep circular shaft lined with concrete to a finished inside diameter of 12 ft, lateral excavations and test installations extending up to 200 ft from the shaft, and long lateral borings extending up to 2300 ft from the shaft. The estimated time for sinking the shaft to a total depth of about 1480 ft and completing the lateral excavations and borings is about two years. The major underground development planned for the primary test level at a depth of 1200 ft consists of the equivalent of 1150 ft of 15 - by 15 -ft drift. The total volume of rock to be removed from the shaft proper and the lateral excavations totals about 1 / 2 million cubic feet.

40|$|The {{importance}} of LHD (Load <b>Haul</b> Dump) <b>machines</b> in most mine operating systems is evident today. The {{cost of operation}} and maintenance {{is one of the}} challenges, while high availability and reliability are others. The latter will be increasingly important when automatic LHD machines are used more frequently. A key factor for automated LHD system is the planned maintenance process, as all corrective maintenance or accidental break-downs rapidly deteriorate the production system where operators are not present and maintenance personnel not available on short notice. A challenge for manufacturers is to improve the engineering design of their machine and related components (hydraulic systems etc) so as to make them more reliable and also making the machine easy to maintain. The demands on the overall communication systems and new and higher competence and skills needs on operation and maintenance personnel are a few factors that make many mines reluctant to the higher investments in Automated LHD systems. This paper reports some experiences with automated LHD machines in Scandinavia {{and the rest of the}} world and examines some of the issues that make the application of automatic LHD machines restricted by large operators and prohibitive by small mines. It also deals with the maintenance aspects of automated LHD systems and provides some initial considerations from a major Scandinavian research project in the field.

40|$|A barrier net 1, 341 m {{long was}} {{developed}} to reduce the entrainment of maturekokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) into the main irrigation canal intake of Banks Lake in Washington. The dacron net was constructed of 83 -mm mesh (stretch measure) and relied on the visual avoidance response exhibited by salmonids. The net was <b>hauled</b> by <b>machine</b> and cleaning wasdone with high-pressure water jets. The screening efficiency of the barrier was evaluated bynumerous methods including sampling the fishes entrained in the irrigation canal with large nets,mark and recapture of adult kokanee in the reservoir, {{estimates of the number}} of beachspawners, sonic tracking near the barrier, census of the sport fishery, and mortality of kokaneegilled in the barrier. The annual canal entrainment of kokanee declined from an average of 64 %before installation of the net to 10 % afterwards, based on 4 years of catch data. An estimated 35, 391 adult kokanee, based on mark-and-recapture estimates, were retained in the lake duringthe fall of 1978 when 96 % retention of the population was achieved. Sonic-tracked kokanee wereturned back by the barrier and, during October, homed to beach spawning sites. From a creelcensus, it was estimated that anglers caught 46, 427 kokanee in 1978. The catch of kokanee perangler-hour remained stable at 0. 216 while the catch of all other species declined from 0. 372 to 0. 042 from 1972 to 1978. The barrier net enhanced the sport fishery and the spawning populationin the reservoir.

40|$|Summary. Forest fires pose a {{great risk}} to nearby {{communities}} and dwellings. Many forest managers {{work to reduce}} such risks by managing fuels. Efforts are underway to understand the economics and the logistics required to extract harvested forest biomass for utilization instead of the conventional disposal method of piling and burning on-site.

Trials in the Superior National Forest examined the feasibility of using conventional equipment to extract and utilize forest biomass compared with disposal of biomass with pile and burn techniques. Factors that increase the costs of biomass utilization include: machinery down-time, distance to end users, low biomass price, size of the harvest unit, forwarding distance, the number of <b>machines</b> <b>hauled</b> to sites to complete small sized operations, the modest amount of biomass removed per acre and applying prescriptions that were not designed for extraction logistics.

40|$|The Load <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) <b>machine</b> and its {{operating}} environment create a complex system. Mine productivity {{depends on the}} operation of the LHDs and on the mining environment, including fragmentation, size of boulders, navigation techniques etc. Traditional navigation techniques require a lot of infrastructure to accommodate automatic operation. From fully automated fleets of vehicles, the focus of automation has gradually widened to include more flexible solutions, such as semi-automatic LHD machines, with safety as a main goal. The automatic system used for semi-automation is different from that used for fleet automation in that less infrastructure is needed, and the operator controls only one vehicle at a time. A semi-automatic LHD machine can operate in either manual or automatic mode depending on the need and situation. Several issues must be resolved to maximise the benefits of automation. One is to improve the maintenance strategy, especially preventive maintenance, as it is crucial to avoid the loss of time incurred by unplanned breakdowns. Another issue is the complexity of the mining environment; external disturbances such as oversized boulders, road maintenance etc. can throw the entire investment in automation into question. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the maintenance actions connected to automated LHDs as well as the factors influencing {{the operation of the}} machine. Research methods include a literature review, unstructured interviews, and data collection and integration. Reliability analysis, fault tree analysis and Markov modeling were performed to comparatively analyse manual and automatic LHDs. This thesis presents an approach to evaluate the performance of manual and semi-automatic LHD machines. It describes the maintenance procedures of automatic LHD machines. It includes a study of the reliability of LHD machines with special attention to automatic operation. It studies the operating environment’s effect on automatically operated LHDs compared to manually operated LHD machines, identifies the external disturbances affecting the automatic operation of LHD machines, and introduces a new way of modeling the maintenance and environmental disturbances to determine the best operation mode for the LHD machine. The analysis shows that the production performance of manual and semi-automatic LHD machines is similar. When it comes to the maintenance performance, hydraulic and electric systems are still the biggest reason for machine downtime but the stops are usually short, which means that LHD machines can start producing relatively soon after failure. However, the automatic LHD machine has more time spent in the workshop for the transmission and engine than the manual LHD machine. The difference in reliability between the machines regarding the engine is not significant. But for the transmission there is a verified difference. One possible reason for the difference in transmission reliability could be engaging/disengaging gears when the machine is in automatic mode. The analysis of the operating environment shows that LHDs suffer from mining related, machine related and/or automatic system related disturbances. Seventy-five percent of the stops causing idle time for LHD machines are related to the operating environment. Better fragmentation of rock to avoid big boulders, better constructed roads to minimise the need for road maintenance etc. are keys to the successful operation of automated LHDs. Fault tree models and reliability block diagrams are effective tools for evaluating the reliability of a system but {{it can be difficult to}} include mining related disturbances. Therefore, in this thesis, Markov models are introduced to describe disturbances affecting LHD machines and to identify possible differences between manual and semi-automatic LHDs. A fault tree model can classify and analyse failures but cannot show changes between states; this is something a Markov model can handle. The proposed Markov model built for the application shows that the best mode, from an operational point of view, is semi-automatic operation due to its flexibility handling disturbances of different kinds, especially those that are mining related.

40|$|Sublevel caving (SLC) is an {{underground}} mass mining method used to extract iron ore from the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. Although both mines use SLC as the mining method, their implementation varies {{in terms of}} mine design, ring design and draw control strategy. The Kiirunavaara mine has a continuous and massive ore deposit which allows a standard mine design layout, while the Malmberget mine has scattered ore bodies with varying mine design parameters. The two mines also employ different opening techniques for production drifts. Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) uses different information systems to run these highly mechanized mines. The information generated by the various systems is transferred between the different unit operations and is used to optimize the mining process. The mines use GIRON to create, store and display different information related to the mining operation. Information on all unit operations is stored {{in a number of}} databases inside GIRON. The two loading related information systems which support the loading operation are the Wireless Loader Information System (WOLIS) and the Loadrite system. The Loadrite system measures the bucket weights being loaded by the Load <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) <b>machines</b> at the draw point. This information, along with information on planned ring tonnage etc., is displayed to the LHD operator inside the LHD machine using WOLIS. WOLIS provides online data on the ring performance such as grades, tonnage extracted etc. to the LHD operators and the production team. In SLC, the different aspects of loading at the draw point include loading procedures, loading issues, loading criteria and loading constraints. Loading procedures include the practices and precautions taken during loading at the draw point. Loading issues include events observed at both mines, such as brow failure, ring freeze, hang-ups etc. Although most loading issues are handled in a similar manner, hang-up handling techniques are different at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. Loading criteria and constraints along with the nature of material flow collectively provide a complete understanding of the draw control strategy. Loading criteria comprise a set of rules or guidelines for loading and closing a draw point. LKAB uses WOLIS to enforce the loading criteria for its SLC operations. Loading constraints include production constraints, grade control and mining constraints which must be followed for a safe and sustainable mining operation. A baseline analysis of the draw control and loading operations at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines is summarized in this report using information collected through internal documents, meetings, e-mails and manuals.   Improved Resource Efficiency through Dynamic Loading Contro...|$|R
40|$|Load <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) <b>machines</b> {{are used}} in {{underground}} mines to load and transport ore and minerals. Loading and hauling blasted ore from drawpoint to dumping point constitute {{a significant portion of}} the production costs for mining companies. There are a number of operation modes available for LHDs, and there are many criteria to consider when selecting the best one. The use of automated LHDs has been widely discussed due to the potential to increase productivity. The increasing focus on safety and ergonomics also gives an edge to automatically operated loaders over manually operated ones. Mine managers must decide when it is preferable to use manually operated loaders and when to complement or replace these with automatic ones. Automation focus has over the years gradually shifted from having automated fleets of vehicles to the more flexible solutions with semi-automatic LHDs gaining safety as one of the main goals. Several issues must be resolved to maximize the benefits of automation. One is to improve maintenance, and moving from operatorassisted “fail and fix” to planned maintenance. Since the operator is removed from the machine during automatic operation and maintenance staff is not always available on short notice, it is crucial to increase planned maintenance to maximize the investment in automation. Another issue is the complexity of the mining environment, including both the infrastructure and external disturbances like oversized boulders and road maintenance, as these can throw the entire investment in automation into question. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the maintenance actions connected to automated LHDs as well as the factors influencing the dependability of the machine. Research methods include a literature review, interviews, and data collection and analysis. Real time process data, operation and maintenance data have been refined, integrated and aggregated to make a comparative analysis of manual and automatic LHDs. The analysis show that 75 % of the stop occasions causing idle time for LHDs relate to the operating environment, 21. 5 % pertain to machine related issues and 3. 5 % are related to the infrastructure of the automatic system installed in the mine. There is no difference in what kind of maintenance actions that are taken for manually and automatically operated LHDs, but there is a difference in what type of failures that occurs more frequently for the different operation modes. For automation of LHDs too much unplanned repairs and maintenance work significantly reduces the overall availability and can jeopardize the entire investment in automation. The difference between the semi-automatic and the manual LHD was found to be very small in terms of maintenance cost versus produced number of tons. However, a semi-automated LHD is an optimal machine regarding the ability to adapt to reconfiguring the operation mode to meet demands such as safety, flexibility and productivity.
