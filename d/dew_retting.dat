40|$|Grading of {{flax fibre}} in Canada, {{and in all}} other flax-producing countries, is done by {{professional}} graders who judge the flax by appearance (cleanness, glossiness, length of fibre, colour), by handle or feel (weight, softness), and by strength (breaking a few strands of fibre in the hands). Because this method is based on human judgment, two graders may award different grades to samples of the same fibre. It was felt that if some scientific method for ascertaining grades could be obtained, {{it would be a}} valuable contribution. Hence, a series of chemical determinations was made on flax fibre of various grades produced by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> in an attempt to assess the quality of flax fibre by chemical analysis. Concurrently, use was made of the Pressley Cotton Fibre Strength Tester {{to determine whether or not}} this machine could be adapted to flax fibre and yarn to differentiate between grades by means of physical tests. An investigation was made also of various types of chemical retting procedures. Because of the speed with which flax straw can be retted by chemical solutions, an attempt was made to determine if fibre of quality equal to that obtained by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> could be produced thereby. The chemically retted fibre then was subjected to the physical and chemical tests used in the attempts to appraise flax produced by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of retting flax {{recently}} developed {{to suit the}} United Kingdom climate has allowed the reintroduction of flax growing to this country. The weed killer glyphosate is sprayed on the crop which then rets before harvesting six weeks later. The acute bronchoconstrictor responses of 11 normal subjects to dust from <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> and from pre-harvest retted flaxes were compared in a double blind crossover fashion. There {{were no significant differences}} in the dust levels nor in the size of the dust particles in the experimental dust room. The decreases in pulmonary function after six hours of dust inhalation were significantly larger after pre-harvest retted flax dust than after <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> flax dust (delta FEV 1, - 0. 21 and - 0. 40 1; delta MEF 50, - 0. 72 and - 1. 211 /s; delta sGaw (specific airway conductance), - 0. 17 and - 0. 65 kPa/s for <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> and pre-harvest retted respectively). The subjects also reported more symptoms after inhaling pre-harvest retted flax dust. It is concluded that the acute bronchoconstrictor response to flax dust is increased by pre-harvest retting, suggesting an increased risk of byssinosis...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{strains of}} {{filamentous}} fungi and one yeast were isolated from flax that was <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> in the United States. These filamentous fungi were subcultured to purity and identified, and six appear {{not to have}} been reported earlier as isolates from dew-retted flax. Five of the purified U. S. strains, two fungi isolated from flax that was <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> in Europe, and a laboratory culture of Aspergillus sojae were tested for their ability to ret flax stems. The monocultures were evaluated for the degree of retting, fiber strength, dry weight loss, and tactile response (i. e., feel of softness) as reflected in the retted fiber. Structural modifications of representative samples of the retted flax were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. All of the filamentous fungi were able to carry out some retting, whereas the isolated yeast could not. All organisms produced pectinases when they were cultivated in shake flasks on ball-milled flax as the sole carbon source. Some fungi also produced cellulases, mannanases, and xylanases. Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium lateritium were noteworthy as retting organisms by their high level of pectinase activity, ability to attack noncellulosic cell types without attacking cellulose, capacity to penetrate the cuticular surface of the stem, and efficient fiber release from the core. The results indicated that these organisms deserve further study as potential organisms for retting of bast fibers in industrial applications...|$|R
50|$|Bacteria {{are used}} to {{separate}} fibres of jute, hemp, and flax {{in the process of}} retting. The plants are immersed in water and when they swell, inoculated with bacteria which hydrolyze pectic substances of the cell walls and separate the fibres.

40|$|Twenty-seven samples {{representing}} {{variations of}} retted flax fibers are analyzed using a color spectrophotometer and CIELAB models. Variables included enzyme or <b>dew</b> <b>retting,</b> fiber or seed flax, enzyme and chelator concentrations, and sequential cleaning steps. In addition {{to differences in}} color with enzyme or <b>dew</b> <b>retting,</b> the variables involved in enzyme retting also contribute to differences in the lightness, redness-greenness, and yellowness-blueness of the resulting fibers. Dew retted fiber flax, as well as seed flax that has weathered during storage prior to enzyme retting, is significantly darker than non-weathered, enzyme retted fiber flax. Painvise comparisons show that lower enzyme concentrations (0. 05 % v/v as commercially supplied) produce redder and yellower fiber samples than those retted with higher (0. 3 % v/v) enzyme levels. Higher chelator levels, (i. e., 50 versus 25 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) produce redder fibers. Fiber lightness significantly increases with additional cleaning steps. Results indicate that objective color measurements and color standards can define important fiber properties in order to tailor raw materials for specific industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|Extracting flax fibers {{from the}} stems of Liriiirn usitatissitiizim plants has {{traditionally}} been a costly, labor-intensive process, largely restricted to Europe and Asia. The naturally long, strong fibers are typically processed on wet spinning machines that are not available in the United States. However, the resurgent popularity of flax has promoted an interest in devising more economical methods of producing and processing the fibers dornesti-cally. This preliminary study investigates the use of flax fibers extracted by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic retting as well as traditional (<b>dew)</b> <b>retting</b> methods. The exper-imental fibers show promise for spinning on common cotton machinery in blends with cotton. The research has produced a series of medium-count, experimental apparel-grade yams with an attractive appearance and acceptable hand. With refinement, chemical or enzyme retting can perhaps become an ecologically sound and cost effective method of producing flax fibers.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} major environmental impacts {{associated with the}} production of hemp yarn using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). A reference scenario of traditional hemp warm water retting was compared to: (1) bio-retting, i. e. hemp green scutching followed by water retting, (2) babyhemp, based on stand retting of pre-mature hemp, (3) <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> of flax. overall, neither of the alternative scenarios was unambiguously better than the reference. The impacts of the hemp reference scenario and the flax scenario were similar, except for pesticide use (higher for flax) and water use during processing (higher for hemp). Bioretting had higher impacts than the reference scenario for climate change and energy use, due to higher energy input in fibre processing. Babyhemp had higher impacts than the reference scenario for eutrophication, land occupation and pesticide use. A reduction of {{the environmental impacts of}} hemp yarn should give priority to reduction of energy use in the fibre processing and yam production stages and to reduction of eutrophication in the crop production phase...|$|E
40|$|A {{homogeneous}} {{batch of}} <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> hackled flax {{was divided into}} two portions. One was untreated {{and the other was}} steamed for 45 minutes at 125 degrees C in three pressure/vacuum cycles in an autoclave. Dust was collected when the two flaxes were separately processed by industrial doubler and stapler machines. From untreated flax 7. 2 g of dust was collected per kilogram of flax after two processing operations. From the steamed flax 4. 4 g of flax was obtained per kilogram after four operations. A method was devised to disperse the dust in a room to produce dust levels similar to those encountered in a dusty mill (4. 5 - 5. 7 mg/m 3). Twelve normal volunteers from the managerial staff of the linen industry of Northern Ireland inhaled the dust over six hour periods. With the untreated flax decreases were obtained in mean forced expiratory measurements of 7. 6 % in FEV 1 and 4. 5 % in FVC (p less than 0. 01). A double blind crossover comparison of similar levels of untreated and steamed flax dusts showed 30 % less impairment of the forced expirations with steamed than with untreated flax (p less than 0. 05). If these responses reflect the long term airway effects of flax dust then the steaming of flax may help in reducing byssinosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of polymers including the {{renewable raw materials}} starch and flax is subdivided into two main emphasis. The first emphasis describes the {{development of}} polymer blends based on numerous different kinds of thermoplastic starch (TPS) combined with both matrix systems of polypropylene and poly-#epsilon#-caprolactone. The compounding of blend materials is realized by means of co-rotating, close intermeshing twin screw extruders. Functional relations between melt rheology, material compositions, process parameters, morphology and mechanical blend properties will be worked out basically. The results clearly show that the morphology formation can't be exactly described with models of conventional synthetic polymers. Instead, the criteria concerning drop breakup and phase inversion must be modified due to the distinctive elastic melt properties of thermoplastic starch. Furthermore, within extensive climate test series will be examined, to what extent it can be managed with the matrix systems to protect the microdisperse incorporated TPS phase from direct influence of humidity and temperature so that these materials have a long time stability in physical and mechanical properties. The second emphasis is optimizing the mechanical properties of fibre composite materials composed of <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> flax and a polypropylene matrix. To enhance the fibre/matrix interactions, various maleic anhydride based adhesion systems have been tested. The best results will be achieved by a direct reactive modification of polypropylene with maleic anhydride (MAH). The MAH grafting {{as well as the}} incorporation of natural fibres into the melted polypropylene is implemented by a co-rotating, close intermeshing twin screw extruder. The result of fibre incorporation with conventional screw elements like kneading blocks or turbine mixing elements turns out that no satisfied fibre dispersion could be obtained without having a drastic reduce in fibre length. Only with newly developed special comb elements a gentle fibre dispersion culminating elementary fibre structures can be generated to reach its maximum strength as well as impact toughness. The final challenge in process technology is to integrate separated preliminary steps of MAH-grafting, fibre incorporation and shaping in a single step compounding/press as well as compounding/injection moulding procedure.

30|$|In retting, {{producing}} a long fiber {{is a difficult}} task during the processing of bast plants. The standard strategies used for separating the long bast fibers are <b>dew</b> and water <b>retting,</b> each of those requires 14 – 28  days. Although the fibers made from water retting can be of prime quality, the long time and pollution have created this technique undesirable (Paridah et al. 2011). With the approach of biotechnology within the textile industry, new biological treatments emerge at recent times. Bacterial/enzymatic retting is superior to other retting processes by having much shorter retting time, higher fiber quality without significant damage and lower pollution (Hoondal et al. 2002; Van Sumere 1992).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to obtain {{information}} {{on the performance of}} four European hemp cultivars piloted at five different sites in the Eastern Cape (South Africa), by assessing the fibre content of each cultivar grown under different agronomic experimental design. The southern region of the Eastern Cape is characterized by long day-length periods compared to other areas and it can be an ideal area suited for hemp cultivation in South Africa. According to the objectives of the project work plan, selected hemp straw samples from the four hemp pilot sites were investigated to determine the hemp fibre content. The experimental results gave information about the fibre content in general and in accordance to the agricultural parameters as documented in the report on “Hemp cultivar adaptation trials in the Eastern Cape ” by the Agriculture Research Council – Institute for Industrial Crops, the ARC-IIC, as well as an indication of the best performing cultivars of the four piloted in the Eastern Cape Province.

40|$|With the {{increase}} of the demand for recyclable materials the usage of natural fibers in technical textiles goes up. Hemp areas just for fibre production slightly grow up every year. Basically foreign varieties are used. To assess the suitability of these Cannabis Sativa varieties in Latvian climatic conditions fibers obtained from the fields of Agricultural Centre of Latgale were studied. Experiments were started in 2010 with the analyse of fibres from nine varieties: Bialobrzeskie, Beniko, Epsilon 68, Fedora 17, Felina 32, Santhica 27, Futura 75, USO 31, Finola. All varieties are devised for obtaining fibre, except of the variety Finola. The fibres of this variety were studied to compare them with fibers of local variety Purini. Variety Purini not only gives very good amount of seed, but also much larger straw yield than the variety Finola. Therefore the task is to examine if hemp of variety Purini is good for both seed as well as fibre production. The yield and fibre quality of different varieties {{in the field and}} laboratory experiments were examined. The thickness, flexibility and tensile properties were determinedto characterize fibre quality. Fibres were obtained from different places of the straws to determine the type of cutting. The best fibres were in the middle part of straws. Therefor it is better to cut hemp in several levels. From the experiments there was drawn a solution that it is better to cut hemp during blooming. Then it is more time for <b>dew</b> <b>retting.</b> There were examined influence of both seed sowing amount and usage of nitrogen amount on fibre quality and straw yield.

40|$|Presently {{there are}} two forms of {{biological}} fibre extraction, water retting or <b>dew</b> <b>retting,</b> which use bacteria or fungi, respectively. Microbial action results in release of the cellulose fibres due to modification of the pectin, hemicellulose and lignin content from parenchyma cells and the middle lamellae. Water retting results in pollution, high costs associated with labour and drying, as well as significant waste water production, while disadvantages to <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> include the need for appropriate climates, variable and inferior fibre quality, risks of over-retting as well as health effects due to dust and fungal contaminants. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to explore silage retting as a new pre-processing technique allowing use of available farm infrastructure and contained retting conditions to produce plant-derived fibres with improved physical and chemical characteristics suitable for application in biocomposites. The corn processing ability of the hemp retting agents Clostridium felsineum and Bacillus subtilis was also investigated. Pleiotropic and/or crop management practices were assessed by comparing the physico-mechanical properties and the microbial populations during silage fermentation of genetically equivalent conventional, Roundup Ready® (RR) and Bt-Roundup Ready® (Bt-RR) corn isolines. Potential recovery of volatile organic acids in silage retting effluent as value-added chemicals was also explored. The results indicated that C. felsineum is an effective corn retting agent given the effective release of the fibre bundles from the corn pith, with B. subtilis contributing to the retting process by reducing the oxygen content and providing the required anaerobic conditions for clostridial growth. The native microflora present in the plant phyllosphere also showed some retting ability. Composition, thermostability and mechanical properties of the biocomposites produced using the fibres from the retted corn were all found to vary depending on the variety of corn. Specifically, retted Bt-RR cornstalk showed a 15 °C increase in onset of degradation. Divergences between corn silage microbial communities analyzed by community-level physiological and enzyme activity profiling indicated that metabolic shifts were time-, region-, and contaminant-sensitive. Acetic and butyric acid production in silage retting effluent was found to be highest under anaerobic conditions and was also influenced by corn hybrid variety, although a specific variety was not identified as most or least favourable for organic acid production due to high variability. Bt-RR cornstalk material was found to have higher cellulose content and better thermostability with an onset of degradation of up to 45 °C higher than its genetic RR and conventional counterparts. However, fibres from the RR corn isoline produced biocomposites with the highest flexural strength and modulus. RR cornstalk-reinforced polypropylene showed a 37 and 94 % increase in flexural strength and modulus, respectively when compared to the mechanical properties of the pure polypropylene. The Bt-RR and conventional varieties produced biocomposites with an average increase of 26. 5 % in flexural strength and 83. 5 % in flexural modulus. The thermostability of ensiled corn biomass was found to be influenced by region, use of inoculants and silage treatment, while the silage treatment accounted for most of the variability in corn biomass composition. Polypropylene matrix biocomposites produced with (30 wt%) pre- and post-silage corn did not show significant differences in mechanical properties. However, ensiled corn resulted in an increase in fibres and potential microbial biomass of smaller particle sizes with more optimal thermostability and purity, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength and modulus especially at higher extrusion temperatures. Cornstalk is an effective reinforcement material, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength. Whole corn biomass presents a potential alternative to other plant fibres, especially as filler material. Silage retting resulted in fibres with a higher thermostability and smaller particle size distribution that, given their already smaller aspect ratio, could result in better mechanical properties in thermoplastics with a higher melting temperature or biocomposites requiring higher shear for mixing...|$|E
40|$|Bast fibrous {{renewable}} materials, {{as commercial}} crops for {{the manufacture of}} textile based and other products, {{have been used for}} thousands of years to satisfy certain human needs, such as for shelter, clothing, source of energy and tools, and to sustain the livelihood of many communities in countries, such as in Asia, Europe and Africa. Concern for the environment has led to a number of global initiatives that favour the use of natural fibres. It is forecast that the global fibre demand by 2050 will be 130 million tonnes, which the cotton and synthetic fibre production {{will not be able to}} meet. Other than the environmental concerns, the renewed global interest in natural fibres, such as flax and hemp, forms part of a strategy to satisfy the fibre demand. South Africa, notwithstanding the fact that the flax and hemp industries have long been established for thousands of years in Europe, Asia and Egypt (Africa), has no history of the breeding, growing, processing and production of these cash crops. The renewed global interest in these crops has also stimulated interest from South Africa with respect to the development of a flax and hemp fibre industry so as to address some of the socio-economic challenges confronting the country today in its attempts to bring about real development in the rural areas through the cultivation and complete beneficiation of these fibre crops. In this regard, the relevant stakeholders, namely government, research councils, tertiary education institutions, farmers and communities worked together to investigate whether South Africa has the agronomic and climatic conditions, technical expertise as well as the necessary processing and production infrastructure to support the development of a local flax and hemp agro-industry. The purpose of this study was firstly to evaluate the performance of EU flax and hemp cultivars grown under different agronomic conditions in South Africa, and their effect on straw biomass yield, fibre yield and total fibre yield per hectare as well as associated fibre properties, and secondly to undertake mechanical fibre modification trials aimed at producing flax and hemp fibres with fibre diameters close to those of cotton. The minimum fibre diameter targeted being 20 μm. In accordance with the project objectives and work plan, selected <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> flax and hemp straw samples from the various planting sites selected by the Agriculture Research Council – Institute for Industrial Crops, representing all the agronomic conditions under investigation, were taken to the CSIR for fibre extraction and testing. A relatively inexpensive and easy to operate Russian designed and manufactured machine, the CMT- 200 M breaker-cum-scutcher, was used for fibre extraction and the resultant extracted fibre bundles were further refined, using a steel comb, to obtain optimal fibre separation before their physical and chemical properties were evaluated. Results obtained in this research study proved that the climatic and agronomic conditions in South Africa were suitable for the cultivation of flax and hemp, notwithstanding the fact that the fibre yields achieved for hemp were lower than the minimum criteria of 23 percent, and that for flax only just exceeded the 25 percent minimum. The lack of local technical expertise on the growing and retting of flax and hemp, contributed to the low fibre yields. The planting parameters which were found to produce good results for the cultivation of hemp were the October planting date, using a row spacing of between 12. 5 to 25 cm, with a seeding density of between 80 – 100 kg, and the application of 50 – 100 kg nitrogen fertiliser. The use of extra artificial lighting and herbicide treatment did not appear to beneficially improve the hemp fibre yields. Similar considerations for flax cultivation in the Southern Cape region, particularly Oudtshoorn and Outeniqua, indicated that May to July planting dates, using inter-row spacing of 25 cm and sowing density of 63 kg seed. haˉ¹, produced a fibre yield and total fibre yield per hectare above the minimum values of 25 percent and 0, 8 tonnes per hectare, respectively, quoted in the literatur...|$|R
