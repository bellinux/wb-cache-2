500|$|Bang {{started writing}} the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Skørping Station: [...] "It {{was in one}} of those windows behind the flowers that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> face, a face which I {{had not been able to}} erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, I felt like drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover {{illustration}} for this book." ...|$|E
500|$|Vandernoot and Paul {{created a}} strong {{on-screen}} relationship between their characters. David Abramowitz, creative consultant {{from the second}} season onwards, said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> and Adrian together, I thought that if I died, {{and there was a}} Mount Olympus, {{that the two of them}} would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence." [...] Paul said that he was [...] "detached" [...] from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod, but that [...] "...it was a good relationship". Later, he said he [...] "...was sad to see it go." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1969 {{portrait}} {{was commissioned}} by the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery and funded by art dealer Hugh Leggatt. The style of the second painting stood {{in contrast to the}} first. It has been described as [...] "stark and monumental" [...] with Elizabeth [...] "standing against an ambiguous, spare and gloomy, plain background", as opposed to the earlier [...] "glamorous and romantic" [...] portrait. Annigoni said of the second portrait of the Queen that he [...] "did not want to paint her as a film star; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> as a monarch, alone in the problems of her responsibility".|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} before she knocked! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in <b>her</b> white face, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in <b>her</b> trembling hands, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in <b>her</b> look at Laura.|$|R

500|$|Pierre Gilliard later {{recalled}} his last {{sight of the}} imperial children at Yekaterinburg. [...] "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I {{came back to the}} window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ..." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{looking for}} a new vocalist, Maia met Mulan Kwok, a {{performer}} at Barbados Cafe in Bilangan Kemang, Jakarta, in December 2004. Of this meeting, Maia later recalled [...] "When I met Mulan it was like meeting a new lover. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> and I liked her. Just fell in love." [...] Mulan was a café singer from Bandung who sang with Dimensi Band. She was asked to audition for the role and ultimately selected; her appointment was announced at a press conference on 7 April 2005. With Mulan, the group's concept, originally [...] "elegant", became [...] "coquettish and sexy". The group's musical style also changed; while originally R with light piano, it was changed to a rock sound with dominant guitars.|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her?</b> Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E

500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to ask one of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> with her triangular face, I realized that this would be her and nobody else. She looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E
500|$|At Tobolsk, she and {{her sisters}} sewed jewels into their {{clothing}} in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated. Their mother used predetermined code words [...] "medicines" [...] and [...] "Sednev's belongings" [...] for the jewels. Letters from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions. Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg: [...] "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I {{came back to the}} window.

500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
60|$|She paused, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>her</b> {{breath was}} coming more quickly at the remembrance.|$|R

500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew I had my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E

500|$|Billy Vaughn covered [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] on his 1967 Ode to Billy Joe {{instrumental}} album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album My Woman, My Woman, My Wife. Glen Campbell's version {{appeared on}} his 1971 album The Last Time <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>Her,</b> Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album Lonely People, and George Strait's on his 1992 album Holding My Own. Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 Here We Go Again album, {{but she did}} not include it on her 2007 duets album , which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of ABQ Journal. Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2. It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 Greatest Collection at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album The Red One.|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E
