500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{started in}} 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a {{collaboration}} between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto spoke of the name as [...] "a reference, a rough translation from the book. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is interesting, it's {{a metaphor for the}} future," [...] he explained. [...] "Thirty seconds to Mars—the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my brother and I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible." [...] He described it as a name that [...] "works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy." [...] When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.|$|E

As a kid I {{read a lot of}} books like The Naked Island about Russell Braddon and his experiences on the Burma-Thai Railway and The Cattle King, which is the biography of Sidney Kidman, and they {{had a profound impact on}} me and I read those books many times. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state {{organized}} around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We {{need look no further}} than the fact that the rest of the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it certainly should be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a religious state is ultimately untenable." ...|$|E

60|$|Therefore I doubt not but children, by the {{exercise}} of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies that environ them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer; amongst which (if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable of examination) <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of hunger and warmth are two: which probably {{are some of the}} first that children have, and which they scarce ever part with again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>I</b> understand--yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> get <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> You have no {{blame for}} the lucky few who {{naturally}} decline to vacate the pleasant nest they were born into, you only despise the all-powerful and stupid mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my hat is gone, however," [...] {{continued}} the younger. [...] "It {{went over the}} hedge, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> of such a slight wind catching it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Luka, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{is a good}} one. The {{people do}} wear their hair long, and our close crops might excite attention. This is better than gold-digging at Kara, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Mr. Clodd. [...] "And {{what do you}} think, Tommy, of the scheme? I may as well {{start calling}} you Tommy, because, between you and me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> will come to something." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Margaret hesitated, but Guy said: [...] "By your leave, my lady, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is a {{very good}} one, saving that I myself will escort the two ladies there as soon as Mistress Agnes feels {{confident}} enough to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Maj.: I wasn’t {{going to}} wait while you were {{founding}} and fostering dynasties in other directions. Why you couldn’t be content to have children of your own, without collecting them like batches of postage stamps <b>I</b> can’t <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> of marrying a man with four children! ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> got <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of tapping {{watching}} Jimmy Page do his [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] solo back in 1971. He {{was doing}} a pull-off to an open string, and I thought wait a minute, open string ... pull off. I can do that, but what if I use my finger as the nut and move it around? I just kind of took it and ran with it.|$|R
60|$|Now, then, at this point, {{something}} occurred which convinces me, {{every time}} I think of it--and {{it struck me}} so at the time--that for a moment, at least, her hopes wandered to the King, and put into her mind the same notion about her deliverance which Noel and I had settled upon--a rescue by her old soldiers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the rescue did occur to her, but only as a passing thought, and that it quickly passed away.|$|E
6000|$|Lizzie {{placed her}} little foot in Kenneth's hand, {{and was in}} the saddle like a flash of thought, and with the {{lightness}} of a rose-leaf. Gildart, being a little fellow, and his horse a tall one, got into the saddle, according to his own statement, as a lands-man clambers into the main-top through the [...] "lubber's hole" [...] in a squall; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was not far-fetched, for, during the process of mounting, his steed was plunging like a ship in a heavy sea. Bucephalus came up at once when whistled to.|$|E
60|$|The above story, I am afraid, is {{a little}} gloomy. I put it down merely for the moral it contained, and I became so absorbed in telling it that I almost forgot what the moral {{was that it was}} meant to convey. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is that if the {{schoolmaster}} had long before abandoned the study of medicine, for which he was not fitted, and gone in, let us say, for playing the banjo, he might have become end-man in a minstrel show. Yes, that was it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, I {{told you}} that Mr. Mortimer was father's best friend. They are both over in England now, {{and are trying to}} get a house in the country for the summer which we can all share. <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is to bring me and Bream closer together." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a final irony, {{the printer}} gave the entire print {{run of the}} {{magazine}} to the Niggerati, {{in the hope that}} they would sell better in quantity, only for several hundred copies to be lost in a fire in the basement in which they were stored. Hurston later commented [...] "I suppose that 'Fire' has gone to ashes quite, but <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is good.".|$|R
5000|$|The artistic {{director}} of the Madison Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra, Maestro John DeMain, has said, “now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of tempo giusto describes just about everything I do or aspire to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might {{mention in}} the orderly room that it is getting so hot now that {{you think it would}} be as well to have a room or two fitted up under a roof, instead of having the sick in tents, in case there should be an {{outbreak}} of cholera or anything of that sort this year. I will say that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is a very good one, and that as the courthouse is very little used, you had better establish yourself there. The native officers who hear what we say will spread the news. I don't say it will be believed, but at least it will serve as an explanation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Sir Patrick!" [...] she said, with {{a little}} silvery laugh, [...] "you have wasted much {{precious}} time and many eloquent words in trying to entrap me into giving my consent, when you might have had it for the asking. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of hastening Blanche's marriage an excellent one. I am charmed to transfer the charge of such a person as my step-daughter to the unfortunate young man {{who is willing to}} take her off my hands. The less he sees of Blanche's character the more satisfied I shall feel of his performing his engagement to marry her. Pray hurry the lawyers, Sir Patrick, and let it be a week sooner rather than a week later, if you wish to please Me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{the voyage}} itself, your {{intelligence}} will {{have told you}} by this time that, thanks to my manipulation, both compasses and chronometers were entirely untrustworthy. I alone worked out the course with correct instruments of my own, while the steering was done by my black friends under my guidance. I pushed Tibb's wife overboard. What! You look surprised and shrink away. Surely you had guessed that by this time. I would have shot you that day through the partition, but unfortunately you were not there. I tried again afterwards, but you were awake. I shot Tibbs. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of suicide was carried out rather neatly. Of course when once {{we got on the}} coast the rest was simple. I had bargained that all on board should die; but that stone of yours upset my plans. I also bargained {{that there should be no}} plunder. No one can say we are pirates. We have acted from principle, not from any sordid motive." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Everyone {{has worked}} wonders {{to get this}} club into {{the top half of}} the Conference. We all agree the club needs {{something}} extra to take it to the next step. As a football fan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> MyFootballClub <b>idea</b> is fantastic. And as the coach, I look forward to the challenge of working with thousands of members to produce a winning team. Alan Kimble and myself are 100% committed to making this work." ...|$|R

I saw a chap with one once, at Athlone: no man could open his mouth as wide as that beast did; and as to its tongue, it would be four times as long as mine. No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> woman <b>idea</b> would be best; but I should have to shave very close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A lonely man laid up with fever, or {{accidental}} injury, fares badly indeed {{if he is}} at {{a distance}} from any town where he can obtain medical attendance, and surrounded only by ignorant natives. I was myself at one time down with fever for six weeks in a native hut, and during that time I would have given pretty nearly all that I was worth for the sight of a white face and the sound of an English voice. As {{to the fact that it}} is possible that the lad might catch fever, or be killed in an affray with natives, that must, of course, be faced; but as a sailor he runs the risk of shipwreck, or of being washed overboard, or killed by a falling spar. Everything considered, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of his going with you is a good one. I don't suppose that many guardians would be of the same opinion, but I have been so many years knocking about in one part of the world or another, that I don't look at things in the same light as men who have never been out of England." ...|$|E
60|$|Few cities, or localities for cities, have fairer natural {{advantages}} than Portland and I am {{bound to}} say that the people of Portland have done much in turning them to account. This town is not the capital of the State in a political point of view. Augusta, which is farther to the north, on the Kennebec River, is the seat of the State government for Maine. It is very generally the case that the States do not hold their legislatures and carry on their government at their chief towns. Augusta and not Portland is the capital of Maine. Of the State of New York, Albany is the capital, and not the city which bears the State's name. And of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg and not Philadelphia is the capital. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> has been that old-fashioned notions were bad in that they were old fashioned; and that a new people, bound by no prejudices, might certainly make improvement by choosing for themselves new ways. If so, the American politicians have not been the first in the world who have thought that any change must be a change for the better. The assigned reason is the centrical position of the selected political capitals; but I have generally found the real commercial capital to be easier of access than the smaller town in which the two legislative houses are obliged to collect themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2016, Walker {{formally}} debated {{a petition}} {{calling for the}} observance of a British independence day in the United Kingdom. Arguing against, he claimed that [...] "tempting though that might be, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an independence day would face fierce competition {{from the likes of}} St George's Day, Trafalgar Day and many more." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We really shot it — {{some people}} in the video did not know we were filming. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> real <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> video is in a moment like that— in a private moment like that, she can never be by herself... This song is not about someone who feels those emotions, it's about Beyoncé feeling those emotions. It's {{personal}} to her. It's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes or what she does, because she's who she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was most}} admirably managed, Fergus," [...] he said, when the tale was finished; [...] "and your making for Vienna, instead of for the frontier, was a masterly stroke. Of course your finding a friend there was most fortunate; but even had you not done so, I {{have no doubt}} you would have got through, somehow. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best <b>idea</b> of all was your taking the post horses, and then getting a fresh suit of clothes from the postmaster.|$|R

5000|$|Kofi A.

5000|$|When asked, Woodley has {{repeatedly}} asserted {{that she does}} not consider herself a feminist: [...] "No because I love men, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of 'raise women to power, take the men away from the power' is never going to work out because you need balance...My biggest thing is really sisterhood more than feminism. I don't know how we as women expect men to respect us because we don't seem to respect each other." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{experience}} and history shaping who we are, I think that was where that idea came from. It's something we carry, our experiences, and something we live with every day, and you know, we make decisions on how we respond to our experiences, but they are what shapes us. So there's that existential idea. There's also {{a little bit of}} a post-relationship aspect to it, but it's not necessarily a break-up album. It's more just an exploration of, ultimately, existentialism.' ...|$|E
5000|$|John Abdulla {{reviewed}} {{the book on}} Oxfam's blog, concluding: [...] "And so the question that remains for me, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> more about <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> laid out in this book, is how can I challenge myself to do more good in this world?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reviewer}} in The Age, in {{a survey}} of the poet's work to that time, was impressed by the collection finding that it [...] "contains the beautiful, evocative poems which, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> place <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> creation of a child back on the plane of understanding that brought the Madonna image into being, and also such hauntingly lovely things as Dream; and in this book; too is the strong consciousness of being 'the maker' — the lyric songs of, the creator." ...|$|R
