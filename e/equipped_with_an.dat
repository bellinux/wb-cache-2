50|$|Turbines <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> diffuser-shaped shroud {{and a broad}} exit ring {{generate}} 2-5 {{times more}} power than bare wind turbines for any given wind speed or turbine diameter.

The turbines were powered by four Wagner ultra-high pressure boilers, designed to put out 58 atmospheres of pressure. The propulsion system drove three screws, although four were considered for Q and R. The ships' electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2,400kW at 220volts.|$|E

5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences.

The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon.
