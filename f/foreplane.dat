25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small <b>foreplane</b> was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small <b>foreplane</b> was lessened, and if the project had developed further, {{it probably would have}} been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Saab {{finalized}} the aerodynamic {{design of}} the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted double delta wing with a small, high-set canard <b>foreplane,</b> equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged {{to be the best}} means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a thrust reverser enabled the sought short landing performance.|$|E
2500|$|Though the NiD 37 has {{sometimes}} been termed a sesquiplane, it is better described as a shoulder-wing monoplane with a small <b>foreplane.</b> Its immediate predecessor was the NiD 31, which had a similar layout though its <b>foreplane</b> was much less far forward {{than that of the}} NiD 37. [...] The two also differed in detail throughout, notably in wing plan and bracing, cockpit position and engine.|$|E
50|$|The F-15 STOL/MTD tested ways to {{land and}} take off from wet, bomb-damaged runways. The {{aircraft}} used a combination of reversible engine thrust, jet nozzles that could be deflected by 20 degrees, and canard <b>foreplanes.</b> Pitch vectoring/reversing nozzles and canard <b>foreplanes</b> were fitted to the F-15 in 1988. NASA acquired the plane in 1993 and replaced the engines with Pratt & Whitney F100-229 engines with Pitch/Yaw vectoring nozzles. The canard <b>foreplanes</b> were derived from the F/A-18's stabilators.|$|R

2500|$|Dieudonné, the {{designer}} of the NiD 37, paid {{particular attention to the}} pilot's field of view, and the open cockpit, with screen and faired headrest, was placed well forward, immediately behind the engine. To improve the his view downward, the leading edges of the main wing, which outboard were straight and unswept, were curved sharply in towards the root, meeting the fuselage just behind the pilot's head. [...] He could thus look vertically down between this edge and the trailing edge of the <b>foreplane,</b> aligned with {{the leading edge of the}} outer sections of the mainplane and mounted well below on the undercarriage struts. Apart from long, curved tips, this <b>foreplane</b> had straight edges and constant chord; it had a span of about 40% that of the mainplane and less than 20% of its area. [...] Its function was largely to bring the centre of pressure forward. [...] The main wing was slightly tapered away from its roots and with square tips. [...] It was built around four spars and covered in stressed 3-ply, with long-span ailerons but no flaps. [...] On each side a V-form pair of tubular struts within aerofoil fairings braced the lower fuselage to the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The Budig glider was {{a single}} seat biplane or {{sesquiplane}} of unequal span and chord with three forward surfaces supported {{on a pair of}} box section booms. The upper <b>foreplane</b> was claimed to provide automatic stability and carried an elevator behind it, though Flight remarked that [...] "It is difficult, from the illustration, to make out exactly what this arrangement is [...] supposed to do." [...] The pilot sat at the upper wing trailing edge, completely exposed at the front of a short central fuselage which supported a rectangular fin.|$|E
2500|$|Platz {{recalled}} sailing a sloop rigged boat, {{which had}} been very stable upwind and capable of maintaining its course without rudder input. He reasoned that the same stability he saw in that boat might be achieved by a similarly rigged glider with a small forewing and a larger rear plane. [...] Just as the sloop could be controlled by adjusting its jib, the glider could be controlled by <b>foreplane</b> trimming. [...] After some preliminary experiments with simple paper models, Platz designed the one-man canard glider which was then named after him.|$|E

2500|$|Though the Nie 31 (it {{had been}} flown and {{subsequently}} abandoned {{well before the}} company {{changed its name to}} Nieuport-Delage) was technically a sesquiplane, it could equally well be described as a shoulder-wing monoplane with a small <b>foreplane.</b> Its immediate predecessor was the Nieuport Madon, which had an ancillary lifting surface built around the axle of its wide-track undercarriage. [...] The Nie 31 had a narrower-track undercarriage, but the second wing extended outwards beyond the wheels, which were faired into its upper surface; this wing and the axle were joined to the lower fuselage by a pair of near vertical N-form struts.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{types of}} bench planes are {{designed}} to perform different tasks, with the name {{and size of the}} plane being defined by the use. [...] Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. [...] This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. [...] A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. [...] A typical smoothing plane (approx. nineinches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteeninches are No. 5, an eighteen inch <b>foreplane</b> will be a No. 6, and the jointer planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. [...] A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3).

5000|$|... or {{give to the}} <b>foreplane</b> alone a {{stabilizing}} role, although as far as {{pitch stability}} is concerned, a <b>foreplane</b> is generally described as a destabilizing surface, the main wing providing the stabilizing moment in pitch.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{successful}} line of Mirages were {{a family of}} supersonic delta-winged fighters, all sharing the same basic airframe but differing in powerplant, equipment and minor details. Early examples were tailless, while many later variants had [...] canard <b>foreplanes</b> added.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the basic hull design, each developed for specific purposes. The Delphin itself relied on a, to today's observers, conventional set of control surfaces with a cross-type rudder and aft hydroplane setup, {{as well as two}} small forward hydroplanes mounted along the centerline, just forward of the one-person [...] "cockpit". American designers moved the fore hydroplanes to the sail, where they could be tilted upward to aid in piercing thin ice in the Arctic Ocean; the British often located the <b>foreplanes</b> forward, {{at the level of the}} deck and enabled them to fold upward so as to not foul harbor structures; those of other countries often retract the <b>foreplanes</b> in ways conventional or novel.|$|R
5000|$|Variable-sweep wing or Swing-wing. The {{left and}} right hand wings vary their sweep together, usually backwards. The first {{successful}} wing sweep in flight {{was carried out by}} the Bell X-5 in the early 1950s. In the Beech Starship, only the canard <b>foreplanes</b> have variable sweep.|$|R
50|$|In the {{close-coupled}} {{delta wing}} canard, the <b>foreplane</b> is located just above and {{forward of the}} wing. The vortices generated by a delta-shaped <b>foreplane</b> flow back past the main wing and interact with its own vortices. Because these are critical for lift, a badly-placed <b>foreplane</b> can cause severe problems. By bringing the <b>foreplane</b> close to the wing and just above it in a close-coupled arrangement, the interactions can be made beneficial, actually helping to solve other problems too. For example, at high angles of attack (and therefore typically at low speeds) the canard surface directs airflow downward over the wing, reducing turbulence which results in reduced drag and increased lift. Typically the <b>foreplane</b> creates a vortex which attaches to the upper surface of the wing, stabilising and re-energising the airflow over the wing and delaying or preventing the stall.|$|E
5000|$|Some types have a {{horizontal}} [...] "canard" [...] <b>foreplane</b> {{ahead of the}} main wing, instead of behind it. This <b>foreplane</b> {{may contribute to the}} trim, stability or control of the aircraft, or to several of these.|$|E
5000|$|A canard is an {{aeronautical}} arrangement wherein a small forewing or <b>foreplane</b> {{is placed}} {{forward of the}} main wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. The term [...] "canard" [...] {{may be used to}} describe the aircraft itself, the wing configuration or the <b>foreplane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fast Stop-Start: By {{vectoring}} {{engine exhaust}} {{from above and}} below the nozzles and turning the canard <b>foreplanes</b> to act as giant airbrakes, the STOL/MTD could decelerate very rapidly and then accelerate fast using its powerful F100 engines. This kind of maneuver might be useful in a dogfight.|$|R
50|$|In particular, the use {{of landing}} flaps on the main wing causes a large trim change. The Saab Viggen has flaps on the canard surface which were {{deployed}} simultaneously to cancel out the change in trim. The Beech Starship uses variable-sweep <b>foreplanes</b> to trim {{the position of the}} lift force.|$|R
50|$|A more {{straightforward}} three-surface {{design is}} seen in several variants of the otherwise conventional Sukhoi Su-27. Following the successful addition of canard <b>foreplanes</b> to a development aircraft, these were incorporated {{into a number of}} subsequent production variants including the naval Su-33 (Su-27K), some Su-30s, the Su-35 and the Su-37. The Chinese Shenyang J-15 also inherits the configuration of the Su-33.|$|R
