40|$|The project ”Design {{solution}} {{in the end}} stripper system for the Grate, to define {{the impact of the}} thermal properties” is about the design {{solution in}} the <b>end</b> <b>stripping</b> system that has been suggested to keep the clearance between the Grate conveyor and the tip of the end stripper more constant. In order to investigate the reason behind the varying clearance, the idea was to make measurements on different parameters in the system. Due to some difficulties in getting the measurement equipment in to the system without affecting the production, the measurements could not be done during the project time. For this project, much time where spent on collecting information and drawings, as well as interviewing employees at LKAB that has experience of working with the <b>end</b> <b>stripping</b> system, or in other way is familiar with the problem the system has caused. The collected information and drawings have formed the basis for a CAD model of the <b>end</b> <b>stripping</b> system, as well as a set of requirements that the new solution must meet. The design solution suggested in this work to define the impact of the thermal properties on the steering rod and thus the clearance, is an extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation as well as a relocation of the attachment between the end stripper plate and the steering rod. The extension of the cooling duct resulted in an additional 500 millimetres of the steering rod, being cooled. After some minor changes in {{the upper part of the}} steering rod, could the heat insulation be extended by 553 millimetres. The efforts to move the attachment between the <b>end</b> <b>stripping</b> plate and the steering rod resulted in a decreased factor for the change in clearance, from 4, 2 to 2, 2. The extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation was validated by inserting the new steering rod in the model for the system. To validate the durability of the components after the modifications, a FEM (Finite Element Method) -analyses was performed with Nastran as solver.
