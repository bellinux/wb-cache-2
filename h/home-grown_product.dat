50|$|A {{city can}} be {{provided}} with wide variety of different food types - wheat, vegetables, fruits, fish and meat - harvest various different resources - vines, olives, timber, clay, iron and marble - and process various manufactured goods - clay into pottery, timber into furniture, olives into oil, vines into wine and iron into weapons - based upon some of those that the Romans were exposed to. In the game, however, what {{can be provided}} is restricted by what they can be acquired locally from a city's region {{and what they can}} import from other cities, thus restricting what industrial buildings they have access to; a city that can't produce olives can still produce oil if there is a trade partner who can supply the raw material. Whatever food and raw materials can be harvested locally require specific structures built on or close to certain terrain - farms need to be placed on farmland (marked by yellow tufts of grass), quarries and mines need to be placed next to rocks, timber yards need to be placed next to woodland, and clay pits need to be close to a body of water. Fishing, while requiring a wharf be placed on a stretch of straight coastline, also requires a shipyard to supply it with a fishing boat, with a single wharf capable of only handling one boat. Goods that can be made locally require a workshop to produce them, and a supply of its required material from either a local or imported source; players have to import goods from somewhere else if they have no access to raw materials, although wine is an exception in terms of patricians, since they require both a <b>home-grown</b> <b>product</b> and an imported brand to reach the highest levels of housing.|$|E
40|$|First paragraph: The name of Jonathan Edwards {{does not}} loom large in {{histories}} of theology in Britain. The American is usually ignored, as in Bernard Reardon’s study of Religious Thought in the Victorian Age, or {{relegated to a}} single allusion, as in Tudur Jones’s Congregationalism in England, 1662 - 1962. By contrast, accounts of parallel developments in the United States give Edwards pride of place. That is true of general overviews such as Mark A. Noll’s America’s God and E. Brooks Holifield’s Theology in America {{as well as more}} specialist works such as Allen C. Guelzo’s Edwards on the Will: A Century of American Theological Debate and Joseph A. Conforti’s Jonathan Edwards, Religious Tradition & American Culture, both of which examine the subsequent reputation of the theologian. It is not surprising that American authors should lay stress on a <b>home-grown</b> <b>product,</b> but it is more culpable that writers about Britain should neglect him. The lacuna may be laid at the door of multiple presuppositions. One is a certain insularity, the silent assumption that Britain was self-contained in its doctrinal concerns, or, if affected at all, then swayed almost exclusively by influences emanating from Germany. Another is that the Church of England led the way in Christian intellectual affairs to the extent that patterns of thinking in other denominations were of little or no importance. And a third is that what mattered in Anglican thought in the nineteenth century was the emergence of the Oxford Movement and of liberal theology because they shaped the developments of the twentieth century, a belief that has discouraged the scrutiny of Evangelical thought at the time. All these notions may be detected in Reardon’s lucid book on Victorian theology, the standard work of the last generation. Yet in reality British readers frequently absorbed American texts, which after all were written in their own language. Many of these readers were outside the Church of England, for at mid-century nearly half the population at worship in England and Wales was Nonconformist and Scotland was overwhelmingly Presbyterian. And Evangelicalism, though it was to be eclipsed during the twentieth century, was in the ascendant in British society at large during much of the nineteenth century. Hence at that period an American who was a non-Anglican Evangelical was likely to enjoy a wide influence. Despite the general neglect of Jonathan Edwards in the literature, his legacy to subsequent generations in Britain is amply worth exploring...|$|E
5000|$|Along with {{a growing}} town economy, {{agricultural}} endeavors were also booming around Pine Bluffs. In 1909 the local farmers {{got a chance to}} show off their hard work and dedication to the land. A unique but successful fair called the [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] was put on to showcase the vegetable and dry-farming section variety in the town. The main feature of the fair was the Grain Palace. Built entirely of different grain crops, this magnificent building covered 24 by 36 ft and 14 ft to the eaves. The Grain Palace was filled with exhibits of area artwork made from <b>home-grown</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

50|$|Moreover, the plantings have so {{far been}} mostly of Chinese species, but the {{products}} are not readily available. The American Chestnut Foundation recommends waiting a little while more before large-scale planting. This is because it and its associates (the American Chestnut Cooperators' Foundation and many others from education, research and industry sectors contributing to the program) are at the last stages of developing a variety that {{is as close as}} possible to the American chestnut, while having incorporated the blight-resistant gene of the Asiatic species. Considering the additional advantage that chestnut trees can be easily grown organically, and assuming the development of brands in the market, it has been asserted that, everything else being equal, <b>home-grown</b> <b>products</b> would reach higher prices than imports, the high volume of which indicates a market with expanding prospects. As of 2008, the price for chestnuts sold fresh in the shell ranges from $1.50 per pound ($3.30/kg) wholesale to about $5 per pound ($11/kg) retail, depending mainly on the size.|$|R
5000|$|Russell Pasha {{considered}} hashish consumption as {{a relatively}} innocuous habit, {{in comparison to the}} [...] "plague" [...] of heroin and cocaine consumption, which became popular after the First World War. Baron Harry D'Erlanger, Russell's associate, similarly declared that hashish {{was no more than a}} 'pet failing of many members of the poorer classes'. According to D'Erlanger, Russell considered legalizing the drug, turning it into a revenue-producing good, thus preserving national funds, which would be spent on <b>home-grown</b> <b>products</b> rather than importing from abroad. This consideration echoes those of Caillard, Cromer, and Kitchener, based on the Indian policy. Nahas writes that British officials, and particularly Russell, did not care enough about the drug because they saw hashish intoxication as [...] "one expression of oriental languid and dreamy temperament". Even though several British officials supported the legalization of the drug, they continued to enforce the ban and guarded Egyptian borders, ports and shores to get a hold on the small percentage of the hashish that eventually found its way to Egyptian consumers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to Codex Alimentarius, {{pesticides}} {{are considered}} as chemicals that prevent, suppress, destroy and repel some pests during manufacture, storage, transport or processing of food, feed and agricultural goods. These chemicals {{can also be}} used as plant growth regulator, as defoliant, agent inhibition. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the content of organochlorine pesticides in <b>home-grown</b> vegetables <b>products.</b> The objectives were the establishment of the working matrices and the organochlorine pesticides determination in the matrices chosen by GS method. Due to the high cost of analysis, the vegetable matrix was consisted in 12 sample- lettuce and spinach samples grown in garden and roots samples (carrots, parsley, parsnip and celery) from both home-grown production. Organochlorine pesticide residues were extracted from the sample with acetonitrile and petroleum ether, purified by passage through florisil column and eluted with a mixture of ethyl ether and petroleum ether. Concentrated eluate was subjected to gas chromatographic determination. In all examined samples, there were identified organochlorine pesticide residues with high residual, HCH, DDE, DDT, DDD, endosulfan, and heptachlor, some being above the maximum allowed by European legislatio...|$|R
40|$|In the 1950 s and 1960 s, after gaining {{independence}} from their colonial powers, most developing countries adopted “market substitution” as their policy {{for economic development}} and growth. In essence, this was an industrialisation strategy followed by these developing economies to concentrate on <b>home-grown</b> <b>products</b> and nurture their expertise {{in order to reach}} the status of industrialised nations. However, by the end of 1970 s, many developing countries began to realize the failures of their inward-looking approach to industrialization when their economies were mired with high unemployment, inflation and chronic external debt. By the middle of 1980 s, many of these countries began to change their policies and reorient themselves into market economies. However, with financial crises and economic recessions that resulted from pursuing market driven liberalization policies, these economies began to realize the flaws of the market driven approach to industrialization. Nevertheless, they continued with the liberalised policies incorporating market as well as non-market (institutional) reforms, aimed at strengthening regulation, improving corporate governance and curbing corruption to avoid the destabilising consequences of financial liberalization. The evolving economic policies that influenced financial development and growth in developing economies came about with the objective of enhancing household and private sector‘s savings. These policies have been designed to influence financial development and economic growth (which can impact upon private savings) in two different ways: (i) by increasing saving due to households taking precautionary motives, or (ii) negatively by spending more due to increase in overall expenditures. Theoretically, the combined effect on private saving is therefore ambiguous. The purpose of this thesis is to assess empirically the importance of various economic factors influencing private sector savings in emerging market economies. In addition, the influence of non-market institutional factors on savings is explored from the incorporation of newly institutional measures into these countries economic policies. Several econometric methodologies are employed with empirical analysis conducted on data for twenty emerging economies across three primary regions in the world, i. e. Asia Pacific, Middle East and North African (MENA), and South America. The twenty countries also include other emerging economies that are proximate to MENA regions such as South Africa, Turkey and Israel. In general, the findings based on SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regression) methodology show that per capita growth, financial development, government savings, and trade openness {{have a positive impact on}} private savings; while youth and old dependency-age groups, real interest rate, and urban growth have a negative effect on private savings. In general, most of these results are consistent with previous studies for other countries. Additionally, causality tests are conducted using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology as well as Pedroni and Johansen cointegration methods within the Vector Error Correction (VEC) model to determine both short-term and long-term causality effects between financial development and economic growth. The results indicate that in the long run financial development has a causal effect on growth; however, in the short run the results are quite mixed. For example, the short run result using the VAR method shows that income growth has Granger causality effect on financial development, but the F-test result for the VEC method shows evidence of bivariate causality. The long-term causality results also confirm the finding of previous research about the importance of developing financial sector in order to spur the country‘s economic growth. The final empirical investigation is to conduct panel data regression to test the impact of non-market institutions on private savings. The main result here is that sound institutional factors based on respect for property rights (e. g. bureaucracy, accountability and regulation quality) have a positive effect on aggregate private savings. Furthermore, political stability is found to have a negative impact on savings while efficient bureaucracy has a positive impact on savings. It can be construed that with an uncertain political environment, i. e. diminishing political stability, the public in general would save more than spend. On the other hand, efficient bureaucracy would boost public confidence about the country‘s governance, which can lead to increased overall savings by the public...|$|R
