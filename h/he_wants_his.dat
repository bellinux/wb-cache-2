Then, Patchy is glad to be back in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).|$|E

500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>his</b> closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

2500|$|Parker's {{sculpting}} style {{can best}} be described as [...] "realism" [...] in the sense that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>his</b> finished product to look exactly like the wild animal would appear in its natural environment.

The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, [...] "Friedman's apparent wish for a 'benign' dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'" [...] and William Easterly who quotes Friedman's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, [...] "Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story" [...] and that, [...] "economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them." [...] However, in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current Chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, [...] "Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent." [...] When asked if he had [...] "China envy" [...] during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, [...] "You detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically." [...] Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>his</b> children {{to live in a world}} where [...] "there's a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did." ...|$|E

He loves electricity and attends the Electrical Convention every year. Avatar is the coach of Sunny's basketball team, but he was temporarily replaced by his wife. It is also mentioned in [...] "Winter Vacation (Part 1)" [...] that Avatar and Himani are not religiously married because they were scammed by a person who impersonated a Pandit; they have a religious marriage with all four children present. His childhood dream was to be a professional boxer, which he showed in his company's commercial. Avatar gets made fun of a lot throughout the series because of his weight, usually by Sunny. He is often shown as unintelligent and breeds much resentment among his kids by being very [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "tight" [...] with his money. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>his</b> family to know him as a [...] "fix-it" [...] man, though his projects never seem to work out. He is slightly afraid of Himani, but he calls it a [...] "strong respect". He has two positions of authority {{when it comes to the}} children: going on outings and barbecuing. He can be lazy but is determined to spend quality time with his wife and children. He has issues with his mother-in-law. It is revealed he has apologized to Himani at least 100 to 200 times, while Himani just soaks it up. In [...] "Baby in Air," [...] it is revealed that he dropped all of his kids. In multiple episodes Avatar brags about having his own band in high school, [...] "Avatar Beats", which made a grand total of one record (an LP, no copies). He can still play bass guitar and occasionally sits in with Rohan and Popi. Late in the third season, Avatar began exercising and becomes more fit. After Himani and the kids staged an intervention to stop his more-revealing wardrobe choices, he admits the catalyst for his getting back in shape was someone in the park mistaking him for Bobby's grandfather. In Good Luck Charlie, Avatar's equivalent is Bob Duncan, who {{is played by}} Eric Allan Kramer.|$|E
