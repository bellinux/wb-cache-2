The study showed that 90 % PAR 1 -AP was desorbed over 6 h, but the peptide was detected in eluates from the microparticle surface after 23 h. The desorbed peptide retained its physiological activity and was capable of activating PAR 1 receptors on human platelets. The study {{of the dynamics of}} experimental skin wound healing in mice showed lower number of macrophages in the wounds treated with PAR 1 -AP microparticles compared to the control (open wounds and wounds covered with microparticles) and higher number of fibroblasts on day 3 of tissue reparation. Hence, PAR 1 -AP desorbed from microparticles shortened the inflammation phase in the wound.

The morphological changes, cell viability, apoptosis induction, and caspase- 3 activity were measured by phase microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. Morphological changes including shrinkage of cells were clearly demonstrated in HL- 60 cells treated with increasing concentrations of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Cell viability was significantly affected by <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In comparison to the control group, <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment had a profound effect in the induction of apoptosis by flow cytometric assays. In the cell cycle analysis, <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> caused the increased percentage of cells in G 2 /M phase and the decreased expression of the cyclin A and cyclin B 1, suggesting the induction of G 2 /M arrest of cell cycle by <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Moreover, <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment promoted caspase- 9 and - 3 activity in a dose-dependent manner, but caspse- 8 activity was not affected during the same process. <b>Glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> co-administrated with broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, caspase- 3 activity was blunted and apoptosis was also markedly blocked in HL- 60 cells.

SRNL is currently performing testing with this flowsheet to support the DWPF down-select of alternate reductants. As part of the evaluation, SRNL was requested to determine the physical properties of formic and <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. Blends of formic <b>acid</b> in <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> were prepared and their physical properties tested. Increasing amounts of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> led to increases in blend density, viscosity and surface tension {{as compared to the}} 90 wt% formic acid that is currently used at DWPF. These increases are small, however, and are not expected to present any difficulties in terms of processing. The effect of sulfur impurities in technical grade <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> was studied for its impact on DWPF glass quality. While the <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> specification allows for more sulfate than the current formic acid specification, the ultimate impact is expected to be on the order of 0. 03 wt% sulfur in glass. Note that lower sulfur content <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> could likely be procured at some increased cost if deemed necessary. A paper study on the effects of radiation on <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> was performed.

OBJECTIVE: The histologic effects of several commercially available <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions at various pHs were examined. METHODS: Test areas of seven <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions were applied to facial skin of two patients. The skin was not prepped for a peel prior to {{the application of the}} acid. The solution was left in place for 30 minutes, then neutralized. After 48 hours, a 2 -mm punch biopsy was performed and examined histologically. RESULTS: The peeling solutions with a pH below 2 demonstrated the potential to induce crusting and necrosis, which was not seen with the partially neutralized solutions with a pH above 2. The higher concentration acids (70 %) created more tissue damage than the lower concentration (50 %) when comparing solutions with free acid.

A literature review was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> on the corrosion of the materials of construction for the DWPF facility as well as facilities downstream which may have residual <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and glycolates present. The literature data was limited to solutions containing principally <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> The reported corrosion rates and degradation characteristics have shown the following for the materials of construction.  For C 276 alloy, the primary material of construction for the CPC vessels, corrosion rates of either 2 or 20 mpy were reported up to a temperature of 93 C.  For the austenitic stainless steels, 304 L and 316 L, variable rates were reported over a range of temperatures, varying from 2 mpy up to 200 mpy (at 100 C).  For 690, G 30, Allcorr, Ultimet and Stellite alloys no data were available.  For relevant polymers where data are available, the data suggests that exposure to <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> is not detrimental. The literature data had limited application to the DWPF process since only the storage and feed vessels, pumps and piping used to handle the <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> are directly covered by the available data. These components are either 304 L or 316 L alloys for which the literature data is inconsistent (See Bullet 2 above). Corrosion rates in pure <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions also are not representative of the DWPF process streams. This stream is complex and contains aggressive species, i. e. chlorides, sulfates, mercury, as well as antifoaming agents which cumulatively have an unknown effect on the corrosion rates of the materials of construction. Therefore, testing is recommended to investigate any synergistic effects of the aggressive species and to verify the performance of materials in the key process vessels as well as downstream vessels and processes such as the evaporator where heating is occurring. The following testing would provide data for establishing the viability of these components.  Electrochemical testing - evaluate the corrosion rate and susceptibility to localized corrosion within the SRAT, SME, OGCT, Quencher and Evaporator. Testing would be conducted at operational temperatures in simulants with ranges of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> iron, chloride, sulfate, mercury, and antifoaming agents.  Hot-wall testing – evaluate the corrosion under heat transfer conditions to simulate those for heating coils and evaporator coil surfaces. Testing would be at nominal chemistries with concentration of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> chloride, sulfate and mercury at high expected concentrations.
