25|$|When declaring a function, a {{programmer}} can specify {{for one or}} more parameters a <b>default</b> <b>value.</b> Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, {{in which case the}} default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters {{at the end of the}} parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.|$|E

Value types are derived from , always have a <b>default</b> <b>value,</b> and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor. Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as [...] (a signed 32-bit integer), [...] (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), [...] (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), and [...] (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are [...] (enumerations) and [...] (user defined structures).|$|E

40|$|Machine {{learning}} algorithms {{have been}} investigated in several scenarios, {{one of them is}} the data classification. The predictive performance of the models induced by these algorithms is usually strongly affected by the values used for their hyper-parameters. Different approaches to define these values have been proposed, like the use of <b>default</b> <b>values</b> and optimization techniques. Although <b>default</b> <b>values</b> can result in models with good predictive performance, different implementations of the same machine learning algorithms use different <b>default</b> <b>values,</b> leading to models with clearly different predictive performance for the same dataset. Optimization techniques have been used to search for hyper-parameter values able to maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset, but with the drawback of a high computational cost. A compromise is to use an optimization technique to search for values that are suitable for a wide spectrum of datasets. This paper investigates the use of meta-learning to recommend <b>default</b> <b>values</b> for the induction of Support Vector Machine models for a new classification dataset. We compare the <b>default</b> <b>values</b> suggested by the Weka and LibSVM tools with <b>default</b> <b>values</b> optimized by meta-heuristics on a large range of datasets. This study covers only classification task, but we believe that similar ideas could be used in other related tasks. According to the experimental results, meta-models can accurately predict whether tool suggested or optimized <b>default</b> <b>values</b> should be used.

2500|$|The default IEEE 754 {{exception}} handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a <b>default</b> <b>value</b> avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion {{due in part to}} the Ada programming language {{exception handling}} policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow. In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct. According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5. The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that [...] "An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment." ...|$|E
