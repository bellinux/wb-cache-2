40|$|This project {{explored}} the how's and why's of literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> It includes {{a history of}} literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups,</b> research findings, benefits of, and different methods of literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> It provides a systematic resource for teachers who want to incorporate literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> into their language arts curriculum. It also includes the National Council of Teachers of English & The International Reading Association standards for English/Language Arts and how literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> meet and exceed these standards. The second half of my project is based upon my experiences implementing literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> I {{have had the opportunity}} to learn from students while participating in three different literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> over the summer of 2001. I have also had opportunities to work with fourth grade students during my student teaching experience.

40|$|I {{conducted}} a descriptive study of kindergarten students in teacher- and student-led literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> The <b>discussion</b> <b>groups,</b> which augmented the Literacy Place 2000 program by Scholastic, {{were held in}} both of my one-half day kindergarten classes. ^ I conducted the research to give practitioners {{a closer look at}} literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> in kindergarten classes. I provide specific information about teacher preparation for implementing <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> in one-half day kindergarten classes, the utterances of kindergarteners as they interact within the groups, and how children use discussion to construct meaning from the literature. ^ I collected data for 17 weeks in 2001. I generated transcripts from audiotaped discussions of kindergarteners in teacher- and student-led <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> I coded the transcripts and categorized the content into three topics: reader interactions with the text, student construction of meaning from literature, and management issues related to implementing the program. I also used a reflective journal for keeping my impressions of the implementation process and literature discussions. ^ Based on an in-depth analysis of the data, I made five assertions about literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> held in one-half day kindergarten classes. Before implementing literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> at any level, the teacher needs to reflect on his or her teaching philosophy. If the teacher believes that students should be encouraged to compare the literature with their own experiences, the teacher must decide if the benefits outweigh the work needed to implement the program. As stated in assertion number 2, the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, desires, drive, and experiences must be used to face the struggles and successes of implementing <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> in class. Volunteers, parents, administrators, and the classes contribute to the outcome of <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> ^ Assertions 3, 4, and 5 relate to student responses in literature <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> Kindergarteners cite text and illustrations, display personal reactions to the text, and express a desire to read. I address disputes in assertion 4 by identifying problems with turn taking, off-task activity, and misbehavior. In the fifth assertion, I state that kindergarten students in <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> make individual attempts to connect with the text. Students also try to construct meaning through collaboration with others. ...|$|R

Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E
5|$|Though the League for Social Reconstruction {{began as}} more of a <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> than a {{political}} party, it became a force in Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the factors {{that are likely to}} play a role in {{individual}} learning outcomes from <b>group</b> <b>discussions,</b> and it includes a comparison featuring test-enhanced learning. A between-groups design (N = 98) was used to examine the learning effects of feedback if provided to <b>discussion</b> <b>groups,</b> and to examine whether <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> benefit learning when compared to test-enhanced learning over time. The results showed that feedback does not seem to have any effect if provided to a discussion group,and that test-enhanced learning leads to better learning than the <b>discussion</b> <b>groups,</b> independent of retention interval. Moreover, we examined whether memory and learning might be influenced by the participants’ need for cognition (NFC). The results showed that those scoring high on NFC remembered more than those who scored low. To conclude, testing trumps <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> from a learning perspective, and the <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> were also the least beneficial learning context for those scoring low on NFC...|$|R
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing information technology (IT) managers is adapting to change. IT managers must cope with frequent changes in programming languages and technology platforms, all the while implementing new applications within their organizations (Straub & Wat-son, 2001). There are many indicators that this constant change is a challenge for IT professionals and managers. Benemati and Lederer (2001) documented a series of problems that IT profession-als experience when attempting to cope with the rapid changes of the field, namely “realizing the potential of new IT while avoiding the associated risks. ” This study investigates one particular method for dealing with change and skill set maintenance among IT professionals: technology <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> The study also investigates gender differ-ences in the use of <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> Two hundred and fourteen IT professionals were surveyed on what sort of IT-related activities they devote time to, how much problem-solving they attempt via technology <b>discussion</b> <b>groups</b> with respect to those activities, and their perceived community and organizational benefits to participating in such <b>discussion</b> <b>groups.</b> The study found significant gender differences in perceived value of technology <b>discussion</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

25|$|Cognitive dissonance {{occurs to}} a person {{when he or she}} voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) {{unpleasant}} activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group (1956), to qualify for admission to a <b>discussion</b> <b>group,</b> two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.|$|E
25|$|By 1906, {{the group}} had grown to sixteen members, {{including}} Otto Rank, who was employed as the group's paid secretary.

In March 1907, Jung and Ludwig Binswanger, also a Swiss psychiatrist, travelled to Vienna to visit Freud and attend the <b>discussion</b> <b>group.</b> Thereafter, they established a small psychoanalytic group in Zürich. In 1908, reflecting its growing institutional status, the Wednesday group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.|$|E
