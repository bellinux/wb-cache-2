25|$|The {{merits of}} plaintiffs' claims pose {{important}} questions {{relating to the}} propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials.

But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged tortious conduct, namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental to the kind of conduct that defendants were employed to perform.|$|E

500|$|The {{requirement}} of Lorentz invariance takes on perhaps its most dramatic effect in string theory.

The corresponding result for superstring theory is again deduced demanding Lorentz invariance, but now with supersymmetry. In these theories the Poincaré algebra is replaced by a supersymmetry algebra which is a -graded Lie algebra extending the Poincaré algebra. The structure of such an algebra is to a large degree fixed by the demands of Lorentz invariance. In particular, the fermionic operators (grade [...] ) belong to a [...] or [...] representation space of the (ordinary) Lorentz Lie algebra. The only possible dimension of spacetime in such theories is 10.|$|E
