5|$|Henry Gerber {{emigrated from}} Germany in 1913, {{settling}} {{with his family}} in Chicago because of its large German-speaking population.

5|$|On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The bill aims to protect Americans against <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their genetic {{information}} {{when it comes to}} health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.|$|E

5|$|Nigeria's {{human rights}} record remains poor; {{according}} to the US Department of State, the most significant human rights problems are: use of excessive force by security forces; impunity for abuses by security forces; arbitrary arrests; prolonged pretrial detention; judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary; rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; harsh and life‑threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking {{for the purpose of}} prostitution and forced labour; societal violence and vigilante killings; child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation; domestic violence; <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> ethnicity, region and religion.|$|E
5|$|During Danziger's tenure, {{assistant}} rabbis included Alan Greenbaum (1977–1981), Harry Rosenfeld (1981–1984), Constance Abramson Golden—Temple Israel's {{first female}} rabbi—(1984–1986), and Marc Belgrad (1986–1991). Micah D. Greenstein, {{the son of}} rabbi Howard Greenstein, succeeded Belgrad as assistant rabbi in 1991, and was subsequently promoted to associate rabbi. A graduate of Cornell University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government, he was ordained by the HUC. On Danziger's retirement in 2000, he became senior rabbi. An advocate for social justice, he tried to convince the Shelby County Commission {{to pass a law}} forbidding discrimination against LGBT people, and has used the Bible to present counter-arguments to those supporting such <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> biblical verses. He has served twice as president of the Memphis Ministers Association, and sits on the boards of several local non-profit organizations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E

5|$|While {{in college}} he saw firsthand the {{discrimination}} against African Americans in Salem {{when he was}} tasked by his fraternity after a dinner with driving their guest, Black artist Paul Robeson back to Portland, as African Americans were prohibited from staying in hotels in Salem. In 1953, he introduced and passed legislation in the House that prohibited <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> race in public accommodations before federal legislation and court decisions did so on a national level. In 1954, Hatfield ran and won {{a seat in the}} Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. While in the legislature, he continued to apply the grassroots strategy he learned from Earl Snell, but expanded it to cover the entire state to increase his political base.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E

25|$|Most {{charges of}} <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> price are {{difficult}} to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can do to change it. Most <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
