500|$|From October to December 1930, Chaplin {{edited the}} film and created the title cards. When he {{completed}} the film, silent films had become generally unpopular. But City Lights {{was one of the}} great financial and artistic successes of Chaplin's career, and it was his personal favorite of his films. Especially fond of the final scene, he said, [...] "n City Lights <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> scene ... I’m not acting .... Almost apologetic, standing outside myself and looking ... It’s a beautiful scene, beautiful, and because it isn’t over-acted." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the ice {{began to}} melt, the sea began to rise. Initially, sea level rose quickly, about [...] per 1,000 years, {{but then the}} rate declined. On Cape Cod, sea level rose roughly [...] per {{millennium}} between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago. After that, it continued to rise at about [...] per millennium. By 6,000 years ago, the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished continental ice sheet had left on Cape Cod. The water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer Cape's shoreline through {{a process known as}} longshore drift. Those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of Cape Cod. The entire town of Provincetown, at the extreme tip of the Cape, is a spit consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore. Those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of Monomoy. So while other parts of the Cape have dwindled from the action of the waves, these parts of the Cape have grown through the deposition of sediment in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 6,000 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{computing}} pioneer Charles Babbage {{published his}} unofficial Ninth Bridgewater Treatise in 1837, putting forward {{the thesis that}} God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ad hoc miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers anonymously published an influential and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of the}} solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed an ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations led to the unfolding of a preordained orthogenetic plan woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like Adam Sedgwick, and radical materialists like Thomas Henry Huxley, who disliked Chambers' implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. Darwin himself openly deplored the author's [...] "poverty of intellect", and dismissed it as a [...] "literary curiosity." [...] However, the high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, and its popular success, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later. It also influenced some younger naturalists, including Alfred Russel Wallace, to take an interest in the idea of transmutation.|$|E

60|$|I {{am afraid}} you will think me an {{abandoned}} ruffian {{for not having}} acknowledged your more than handsome warm-hearted letter before now.

6000|$|Lord Warburton {{had asked}} leave to bid good-bye to Pansy, but neither Isabel nor Osmond had made any motion to send for her. He had {{the air of}} giving out that his visit must be short; {{he sat on a}} small chair, as if it were only for a moment, keeping his hat in his hand. But he stayed and stayed; Isabel {{wondered}} what he was waiting for. She believed it was not to see Pansy; she had an impression that on the whole he would rather not see Pansy. It was of course to see herself alone--he had something to say to her. Isabel had no great wish to hear it, for she was afraid it would be an explanation, and she could perfectly dispense with explanations. Osmond, however, presently got up, like a man of good taste to whom it had occurred that so inveterate a visitor might wish to say <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word of all to the ladies. [...] "I've a letter to write before dinner," [...] he said; [...] "you must excuse me. I'll see if my daughter's disengaged, and if she is she shall know you're here.
