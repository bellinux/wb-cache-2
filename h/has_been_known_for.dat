5|$|Glass fiber {{is formed}} when thin strands of silica-based or other {{formulation}} glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> millennia; however, {{the use of}} these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).|$|E
5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine {{that if people}} are taught evolution they {{can be expected to}} behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found {{to the east of}} the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E

5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{more than}} a century that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour {{as a result of the}} proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> a long time, and in 1890 {{the first}} publication described the elevated cancer risk {{of workers in}} a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although {{it can also be}} stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of certain Galerina species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G.autumnalis. In 1954, a poisoning {{was caused by}} G.venenata. Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G.marginata and G.unicolor, respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G.venenata, with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by G.autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio. Several poisonings {{have been attributed to}} collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe stuntzii.|$|E
5|$|The Andalusian, {{also known}} as the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE (Pura Raza Española), is a horse breed from the Iberian Peninsula, where its {{ancestors}} have lived for thousands of years. The Andalusian has been recognized as an individual breed since the 15th century, and its conformation has changed very little over the centuries. Throughout its history, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> its prowess as a war horse, and was prized by the nobility. The breed was used as a tool of diplomacy by the Spanish government, and kings across Europe rode and owned Spanish horses. During the 19th century, warfare, disease and crossbreeding reduced herd numbers dramatically, and despite some recovery in the late 19th century, the trend continued into the early 20thcentury. Exports of Andalusians from Spain were restricted until the 1960s, but the breed has since spread throughout the world, despite their low population. In 2010, there were more than 185,000 registered Andalusians worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Though UCSC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students {{since it was}} founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing {{its impact on the}} environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E
