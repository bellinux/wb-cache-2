5|$|Bonfire (March 21, 1983 – October 28, 2013), {{full name}} Gestion Bonfire, was an Oldenburg gelding that competed in {{dressage}} with Dutch rider Anky van Grunsven. Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} she would <b>ever</b> <b>find</b> a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E

5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males <b>ever</b> <b>find</b> a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E

500|$|Written by musicians Cory Lerios and George Gabriel, the show's {{theme song}} [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] (also known as [...] "Call Me, Beep Me!

Having already {{been working for}} Disney Channel at the time, appearing as a correspondent on the network's miniseries Movie Surfers after declining an offer to appear on their variety show The Mickey Mouse Club, Milian learned about Kim Possible from Disney when the studio called her in recruitment of an artist to record the new show's theme song. After meeting with the songwriters, who then proceeded to write the song, for the first time, Milian returned to the studio to record [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] one week later. Romano also contributed vocals to the song. Described as a Motown-influenced R and teen pop track, [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] is heard during the show's opening title sequence, encouraging viewers and listeners to contact Kim for assistance should they <b>ever</b> <b>find</b> themselves in difficult situations, featuring the lyrics [...] "Danger or trouble, I'm there on the double." [...] The sounds of mobile devices and modern-day technology are incorporated throughout the song. Although [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] begins [...] "I'm your basic, average girl" [...] in reference to Kim, these lyrics are paradoxical because there is little basic or average about its protagonist.

[...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
