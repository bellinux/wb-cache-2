After marrying Thornton in a civil ceremony on 27 May 2011, he paid tribute to his Jewish heritage by following the tradition of breaking a glass. In 2012, Miliband wrote, [...] "Like many others from Holocaust families, I have a paradoxical relationship with this history. On one level I feel intimately connected with it – this <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents and grandparents. On another, it feels like a totally different world." ...|$|E

What's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] He has put his addiction problems down to [...] "boredom". He also said that [...] "I'm {{not one of these}} people who can have one drink and stop. I want another and another and another." [...] His drink problems began after he developed a gambling habit in 2007. His addiction to betting on horse racing cost him £3,000 a month, and left him asking friends and family for money.|$|E
500|$|Alongside the [...] "cheating" [...] rumors, {{the public}} {{inferred}} from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized {{that he was}} not in a relationship and [...] "got another girl pregnant" [...] and he was singing a [...] "character". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the album are his. He stated, [...] "me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> main girl." [...] Behind rumors, Usher refuted in an interview with MTV News: ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains me most of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, and I take it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my personal experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Cartman starts selling {{copies of}} his book, What <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> School?, outside the {{cafeteria}} where Stan confronts him. Angry because of Cartman's outrageous sexual lies about Wendy in his book, Stan tries to convince Cartman to stop selling the books to no avail. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey again confront Cartman, and force him to stop selling his books on school grounds. This upsets Cartman, who accuses them of turning the school into a [...] "socialist horrorland", and insists he is leaving the school. The next day, however, he appears on his show and spins a portrayal of himself in blue face-paint and suspenders, having somehow found Smurfland, becoming part of Smurf culture and eventually {{falling in love with}} Smurfette. Cartman then claims that Wendy bulldozed Smurfland and slaughtered the Smurfs to get their valuable Smurfberries, the complete story of which he has chronicled in his DVD, [...] "Dances with Smurfs". Despite {{the fact that it is}} extremely obvious that the footage of [...] "Wendy" [...] was Cartman in disguise, Butters and a furious mob of students go to Wendy's house to confront her. Butters pees on her front door and demands that she go on Cartman's morning announcements show to answer his questions.|$|E

500|$|Gough and Millar {{always had}} {{intentions}} of bringing Christopher Reeve onto the show. When the pair learned Reeve enjoyed watching Smallville, Gough and Millar decided {{they were going}} to bring him on for season two. They had already crafted a character, Dr. Virgil Swann, they knew would reveal the truth about Krypton to Clark, and they decided Reeve would be perfect for the part. According to Gough and Millar, it was [...] "natural" [...] for Reeve {{to be the one to}} educate Clark about his past, and help him see his future. As Gough describes it, the scene between Clark and Dr. Swann is a [...] "passing of the torch" [...] moment for the series. Gough and Millar explain the importance of the character: [...] "Dr. Swann provided the first tantalizing answers to the quest plaguing Clark for all of his young life. 'Where am I from?' 'What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents?' 'Am I truly alone?" [...] The creative team flew to New York to film Reeve's scenes since he used a wheelchair and required additional assistance when travelling. Although James Marshall directed the episode, for Reeve's scenes in New York the Smallville crew sent Greg Beeman as a stand-in director. Gough, Welling and Mat Beck travelled alongside Beeman to New York, where John Wells, who had previously lent his White House office on The West Wing to the Smallville crew for season one's [...] "Hourglass", allowed the team to use the production offices from Third Watch for Reeve's scenes.|$|E

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I think this is what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> books." ...|$|E

2500|$|Terry Jones – who co-directed the {{original}} film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: [...] "Spamalot is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high {{on my list}} of priorities." [...] However, when asked whether he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. [...] It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That {{is one of the great}} moments where the show really comes alive for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Lady Of The Lake laments {{her lack}} of stage time ("Whatever <b>Happened</b> <b>To</b> <b>My</b> Part?"), Sir Lancelot {{receives}} a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is very {{surprised to find that}} the [...] "damsel" [...] is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert ("Where Are You?"/"Here Are You") whose overbearing, music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. As Herbert is asking Lancelot to help him escape, the King of Swamp Castle cuts the rope that he is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot's sidekick, Concorde. The King asks his son how he was saved, exactly, to which Herbert replies happily with a song. But the king charges at his son with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save him, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech about sensitivity to the king on Herbert's behalf, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process, an announcement celebrated in a wild disco number ("His Name is Lancelot").|$|E
