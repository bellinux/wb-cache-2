50|$|The five main {{evils of}} his {{contemporary}} Italian Church correspond, in Rosmini's view, {{to the five}} wounds of the hands, feet, and side of the Divine Redeemer.

This is to be accounted for by the wound in the right hand — the insufficient education of the clergy, their secularisation and their alienation from scripture and their bishops. This again was both caused and perpetuated by the great wound in the side, which pierced the Heart of the Divine Sufferer, and which Rosmini sees as a parallel for the divisions among the Bishops, separating them from one another, and also from their clergy and people, forgetting their true union in the Body of Christ. The wound of the right foot is compared to the civil power of the Bishops making them into worldly schemers and politicians, more or less intent on selfish interests. The wound of the left foot is compared to events of the feudal period, when the <b>freehold</b> <b>tenures</b> of the Church were treated as fiefs by an overlord, or suzerain, who saw in the chief pastors of the flock of Christ only a particular variety of vassals or dependants.|$|R

40|$|The theorized {{impact of}} land tenure and titling on {{access to credit}} has {{produced}} mixed results in the empirical literature. Land tenure and titling is hypothesized to increase access to credit because of the enhanced land security provided and the newfound ability to use land as collateral. Using land as collateral and obtaining access to credit are paramount concerns in Uganda and in all of Africa, as greater {{emphasis is placed on}} the need to modernize the agricultural system. This paper uses a new approach in evaluating whether land tenure and titling have an impact on access to credit for rural households in Uganda. The new approach includes comparisons across four categories: (1) households who have customary land with versus without a customary certificate, (2) households who have freehold land with versus without a title, (3) households with a title or certificate having <b>freehold</b> versus customary <b>tenure,</b> and (4) households without a title or certificate having <b>freehold</b> versus customary <b>tenure.</b> Each comparison is then evaluated for the impact on access to any form of credit, formal credit, and informal credit. This analysis allows for an in-depth look into which element, tenure or title, is impacting access to credit and to which type of credit, formal or informal. To conduct this analysis, matching techniques are used, including propensity score matching and the Abadie and Imbens matching method. These two methods contain both strengths and weaknesses that allow the results to support to one another. The only significant finding of the matching was a positive impact on access to credit of freehold without title over customary without certificate. Results imply that tenure, not title, impacts credit access for rural households in Uganda. " from authors' abstractLand tenure, Land titling, Rural credit, Land management,...|$|R

40|$|Because {{human beings}} are fated to live mostly {{on the surface of}} the earth, the pattern of {{entitlements}} to use land is a central issue in social organization. As the epigraphs suggest, this issue has been the subject of fierce ideological controversy. Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s paean to private property comports with the mainstream Anglo-American exaltation of decentralized ownership of land. This vision underlies the Homestead Acts, the Jeffersonian wish for a polity of yeoman farmers, and the American dream of homeownership. Defenders of private ownership of land argue that it promotes individual liberty, political stability, and economic prosperity. Indeed, some economic historians have identified the emergence of <b>freehold</b> land <b>tenure</b> in Western Europe after the Dark Ages as a major source of the great release of energy that ensued there. To commentators such as Marx and Engels, by contrast, the creation of private property in land is a fount of evils, particularly inequality in wealth and the splintering of more organic communities into atomized, untrusting social environments of individual competition. The vision of collective living on shared land has had a broad and enduring appeal. It has inspired, among others, the Protestant sectarians, secular kibbutzniks, and counterculture experimentalists who have founded intentional communities.

40|$|Policy {{planners}} in Africa confront {{an interesting}} puzzle. At {{the same time}} that many African societies are changing social norms and indigenous rights in property to more individualistic systems approaching privatization, we find increasing numbers of societies backing away from government sponsored formal systems of <b>freehold</b> land <b>tenure.</b> Even more curious, we often find that the very same societies that evolved indigenous privatization are now shunning government programs. Obviously, something about the supply of formal rights proposed by governments is not meeting the demand for property right change at the local level. Some simple economic explanations provide partial answers: the transaction costs of the registration process are high and lagging markets in essential complementary factors of production (particularly capital) may be constraining growth rather than land. But these explanations are not the whole story. Most agricultural production in Africa is still kin-based and highly risky. Lineages are not just kinfolk, they share some the characteristics of corporations: they cooperate in labor, risk management, and investment. Fundamental to the high level of trust and cooperation that such systems enjoy are basic guarantees of subsistence in the short run [...] through access to land-and the long-run [...] through inheritance of that land. Property right changes that violate this complex of complementary interdependencies are doomed to fail. One need not interpret this failure as violation of a sacred "moral economy"; one can as well impute a cost-benefit calculus to farmers' demands for property rights. But one must include in this equation the costs and benefits as they are realized by the farmer, that is, filtered through the calculus of kinship.

40|$|In 2001 {{the then}} Ministry of Social Policy {{published}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the living standards of older New Zealanders. The current paper revisits the estimated relationship between material well-being and the current income and accommodation costs of older people, and questions {{the extent to which}} income and accommodation costs directly affect well-being or proxy for other factors. We first extend the estimated relationship between material well-being and current income to include the source of the income as well as its level. We find that controlling for different income sources roughly halves the estimated associative effect of income on material well-being. Furthermore, for a given level of income, those with higher fractions of either employment earnings or capital investment income have significantly higher material well-being scores, while those with a higher fraction of income from benefit allowances have lower scores. One interpretation is that these factors may proxy for other causal factors, such as health and wealth effects, rather than reflecting a direct income effect. Next, we extend the original specification between material well-being and accommodation costs to, first, include property rates as an accommodation cost and, second, to control for the type of housing <b>tenure</b> (<b>freehold</b> homeowner, mortgaged, renter, and no accommodation costs). We find that, controlling for housing tenure, the estimated effect of accommodation costs (including rates) is, at most, half that originally estimated and, for some specifications, insignificantly different from zero.

40|$|Purpose – Sale-and-leaseback {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} common approach {{during the last two}} decades in the investment of high street banks (banking-halls) in the UK. One measure commonly used in making property investment decisions is the all risks yield (ARY) which is associated with the level of rental income. Investors and their advisors need to know which factors are likely to result in the highest ARY when assembling investment portfolios of such properties. This research aims to identify those influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative multiple-case study was adopted. A literature review generated a hypothesis which was tested by a qualitative study, based upon semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire, to establish the influencing factors. Expert interviews were held with the heads of those three major auction-houses dominating the market, whilst the questionnaire survey involved investment professionals from within the auction-houses. Findings – The study confirmed that the four factors influencing yields and investors’ decision-making when purchasing retail banking premises were tenant banking company (brand names), regional location (north and south super-regions), lot size (hammer price), and <b>tenure</b> (<b>freehold</b> or leasehold). Research limitations/implications – This investigation focuses on Great Britain’s geographical and political area which includes England, Scotland and Wales, but excludes Northern Ireland. This research focuses on banking-halls as a sub-class of retail property investment. The findings form a baseline upon which further research can be conducted on other sub-types of retail property such as high street shops and retail parks. The results will also underpin the development of a quantitative yield predictive model based on regression analysis. Practical implications – To maximize the returns on property investments, investors and their professional advisors can use those factors having the greatest influence on yields to make informed investment decisions for the building of property portfolios. Originality/value –As a sub-sector, bank premises do not necessarily correlate to the generic retail sector. This research consolidates the broad systematic drivers of retail yields into specific factors influencing the ARY of banking-halls. The findings provide better understanding of an active but sparsely analyzed sub-market of banking hall investments, and by so-doing help investors to maximize their investment returns...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores various tenure {{models as}} a means to {{understand}} development in transition. The emergence of new markets, aspirations, needs and varied agendas of the actors in the LSM Cooperative Housing Estate in Lublin, Poland, has resulted in conflicts in tenure claims to land and building. The tenure options that evolve from these conflicts are in effect choices that open up for the community. This thesis recognizes {{the fact that there are}} other development models apart from the Western free market model that have their advantages and disadvantages in given situations. Development models that have been used in other countries are considered end-state scenarios, which become a means to explore tenure options. The end-state scenarios could range from individual rights (private <b>freehold)</b> to communal <b>tenure</b> holding. Here the argument is that, in-between these end-state scenarios exists a range of development options that can be used in the transition stage. The end-state scenarios discussed are: the Western market model, Cooperative land banks, Sweden's leasehold of land and rental housing system, Britain's council housing, US housing cooperatives, and Hong Kong's land management system. Tradeoffs between scenarios are evaluated by fIltering each scenario through six criteria: efficiency, equity, subsidy, management and community participation, mobility, and difficulty in transition. The implications of each scenario on the LSM Housing Cooperative are studied under three site specific issues: development of neighborhoods, development of the Zana street commercial area and development of vacant land in the estate. An evaluation of end-state scenarios against the various criteria, indicates that given the transition process, there is no single model that can be applied uniformly. The housing neighborhoods, Zana street and vacant land would benefit most if developed with different models. Scenarios that appear more workable than the others are: the Western market model, Cooperative land bank, Hong Kong's land management system and the US housing cooperative. Transference of models does not ensure their success in LSM. Simplicity and clarity of the models is critical to the transition period and the identified models need to be modified to adapt to local conditions. The LSM case study exemplifies housing estates in Poland and other countries undergoing transition in Eastern Europe. This thesis does not attempt to recommend a conclusive tenure system, but gives a methodology that would help identify a tenure system. by Sanjay M. Kumar. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|It {{is argued}} that land {{is perhaps the most}} {{essential}} resource and an important pillar of national development. In Uganda, the management of land is regulated by the 1995 constitution and the Land Act of 1998, which recognise four tenure systems, namely; Customary, Mailo, <b>Freehold</b> and Leasehold <b>tenure</b> systems, each of which possess unique features and associated ownership rights. This study analysed important dimensions largely of a locational and regional nature, on tenure system and the value of agricultural land. The general objective was to investigate the determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. The study hypothesized that institutional factors such as land titles were important determinants of agricultural land prices in Uganda; that there was a significant premium for agricultural land with title/certificate relative to that without, and that the premium for agricultural land with a freehold title was significantly higher than that for other titles/certificates. Data was obtained from the third round of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) conducted by Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) during the 2004 / 2005 crop year. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression techniques using 9, 045 parcel level observations were used to answer the study objectives. Results showed that region, location in the peri-urban and institutional factors such as leasehold title were the major determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. Compared to the Central region, agricultural land in the Eastern and Northern regions had significantly lower prices suggesting a high demand for land in the urbanising Central. Results from the characterisation of agricultural land ownership systems revealed that mailo tenure was dominant in the Central region, whereas customary tenure was dominant in the other regions of Uganda. However, current agricultural use, soil quality, trees/perennials, as well as proximity of agricultural land which were associated with higher land values in developed countries were not generally capitalised into the price of agricultural land. The study recommended that the current land policy should promote the leasehold system in upcoming cities/ or urbanising areas, since it opens land {{to a wide range of}} users and use-options to encourage allocation of land to the best alternative uses. The land policy should also address the double ownership structure under mailo tenure which constrains its marketability and transferability, and probably services to discount its price. This can be done possibly by facilitating arrangements for single ownership of land such that either the landlord willingly sells off his ownership rights to the tenant; or the tenant accepts compensation to leave the land; or alternatively the two parties could agree to share the land. Further research was recommended to explore the benefits of freehold title since it is viewed as the tenure system of the future. More research is also needed on the impact of converting one form of land tenure to another, for instance, on the conversion of customary land to freehold, since it is the dominant tenure system in Uganda.
