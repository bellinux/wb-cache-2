We have used the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in sheep fetuses at 90 to 110  days gestation. MethodsTen mixed-breed pregnant ewes were used over a period of 6 months, and 10 fetuses were placed on bypass for 30 minutes. Five fetuses with a mean gestational age of 104 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 1. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the TinyPump device, and 5 fetuses with a mean gestational age of 119 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 3. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the roller <b>head</b> <b>pump.</b> The fetuses were monitored for up to 3 hours after bypass or until earlier demise. ResultsProgressive respiratory and metabolic acidosis developed in all fetuses. The TinyPump group had a lower gestational age and weight compared with the roller <b>head</b> <b>pump</b> group. However, the rate of postbypass deterioration in the TinyPump group, as measured with blood gases, was noted to be significantly slower compared with the roller <b>head</b> <b>pump</b> group. ConclusionsWe demonstrate the feasibility of the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in a fetal sheep model. The TinyPump group showed improved results compared with the roller head group despite more immature fetuses. The TinyPump device seems to be a promising device for future studies of fetal cardiac bypass in immature fetal sheep and in primates...|$|E

Most studies employ mainstream economic analysis to estimate the costs of achieving the Kyoto Protocol. In contrast, the "no cost" analyses use a unique methodology applied only to energy conservation and referred to here as the energy conservation paradigm. One conclusion is that the energy conservation paradigm is inconsistent with mainstream economics. The "no cost" conclusion used to support approval of the Kyoto Protocol is not supported by the basic principles of economics.

30|$|Contrast {{microsphere}} destruction {{may occur}} within the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> due to several factors. Direct {{contact with a}} rapidly rotating mechanical structure within the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> is {{likely to lead to}} microbubble destruction. Additionally, the non-physiologic and rapid centrifugal flow within the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> is likely to directly contribute to microbubble destruction. The high pressure drop across the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> would contribute to increased destructive shear forces. In this research, there was a statistically significant decrease in microbubble concentration across the <b>pump</b> <b>head,</b> with the most likely mechanism being destruction from shear forces and the turbulent flow. With increasing <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> speeds, there was an increase in microsphere destruction (except for the increment from 1000 to 2000  rpm). With higher spin rates, the destructive forces within the rotor housing would be higher (especially due to increased flow turbulence and greater pressure differentials) and this would result in a greater degree of microsphere destruction within the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b> Whist one could anticipate a linear correlation between microsphere destruction and all <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> speeds, it could be postulated that the absolute destructive forces at these lower <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> speeds (1000 to 2000  rpm) may not be sufficiently different to be translated into a significant difference in microsphere destruction at this lower revolutions per minute increment.

40|$|With growing {{environmental}} awareness, {{power producers}} {{turn their attention}} to renewable energy sources. Favorable government support has in many countries lead to a dramatic increase of wind power development. This has in turn raised demand for hydro pumped storage plants to guarantee the stability of the power grids. To allow for increased reliability and operating range, manufacturers focus on learning more about the dynamic behavior of pump turbines. The Hydrodyna research project is a collaboration project between turbine manufacturers and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland, which aims to improve the understanding of high <b>head</b> <b>pump</b> turbine dynamics. It is not unusual that modern pump turbines operate at heads around 500 - 700 m. For such high heads, rotor stator interaction is known to be of greater significance due to higher water velocities and thicker geometries in stay and guide vanes. The Hydrodyna research project aims to break through a technology gap in the understanding of pressure fluctuations due to rotor stator interaction. This work describes the results from simulations of the turbine operating at full load and its comparison to laboratory measurements. The commercial software Ansys CFX 5 has been used to perform transient simulations with second order backward Euler transient scheme and the k-epsilon turbulence model on structured, high density meshes. The simulations have been run on a twelve CPU cluster with 0. 2 degree runner rotation in each time step. The dynamic behavior of rotor stator interaction is visualized and examined at key frequencies on the pressure and suction side of a runner blade. In order to find the best setup, different simulations have been run on guide vanes and runner with combinations including the stay vanes and draft tube. The results are validated against laboratory pressure measurements on a runner blade. The transient pressure readings, from transducers with measurement error below 0. 001 bar, make it possible to determine the accuracy of the CFD code.

40|$|Improving water {{distribution}} system operations {{can be achieved}} {{through the use of}} optimally generated pump schedules by minimizing the overall pumping cost while satisfying the water pressure and flow requirements and subject to all physical constraints. This study is devoted to developing a general methodology to determine the optimal operations of large scale {{water distribution}} systems. Rather than solving the original mixed integer nonlinear programming problem directly, a two-level hierarchical optimization scheme is proposed. The first level is a NLP problem where the decision variables are each pump station's discharge and added <b>head,</b> <b>pump</b> speeds, valve control settings, nodal pressure heads and tank water elevations. At the second level a simple DP or a direct conversion method is applied to find the best pump combinations based on the optimal solutions obtained from the first level NLP optimization. Prior to solving the two level optimization problem, pre-optimization work is performed which produces a lumped energy function for each pump station to approximate the relationship between consumed energy and pump station's added head and discharge. To make the first level NLP problem solvable, a reduction technique is proposed which uses the network simulation model {{to reduce the number of}} constraints and decision variables. This reduction, however, results in a NLP problem with implicit decision variables which are not directly controlled by the decision variables. One strategy proposed is to consider the constraints of the implicit decision variables in a penalty term appended to the objective function. The problem is then structured using an augmented Lagrangian algorithm and solved with a NLP code. The second strategy is to use an active set method. The entire NLP problem is solved using successive quadratic programming where only the active constraint set is considered during the solution process of each quadratic programming subproblem. Two case studies were performed to determine the optimal schedules and compare the two NLP approaches. The Lagrangian seemed to perform better when many constraints were initially violated, while the active set method seemed appropriate to solve systems with few initial active constraints...|$|E

The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, impeller suction and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total <b>head,</b> <b>pump</b> protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety.

40|$|At {{the time}} that the {{analyses}} contained in this volume were performed, the avoided energy costs of California's regulated electric utilities were at historic highs and were projected to continue to increase at double-digit annual rates. Since that time, oil prices have slipped, the general rate of inflation has abated, domestic electric power consumption has fallen short of expectations, {{and a host of other}} economic elements have shifted in directions which have resulted in substantial reductions in current California avoided energy costs. The question of whether these changes are merely short-term aberrations or represent a fundamental shift in the long-term energy supply and demand balance is beyond the scope of this report. Although the present depressed avoided electric energy prices are not consistent with the projections on which this report's analyses are based, a fact which results in significant discrepancies between the absolute financial returns predicted and those achievable under current circumstances, the comparative results of the study remain valid. The basic thrust of the studies represented in this report was to compare the overall economics of the Gravity Head system with that of optimized conventional binary generating plants. The study is site-specific to the East Mesa geothermal reservoir. It begins with an analysis of optimum individual well production based on the known characteristics of the reservoir. The limiting factors at East Mesa are reservoir drawdown and maximum practical brine pump impeller setting depth. The individual-well production limit is achieved when brine pressure at the pump inlet is reduced to the point at which CO{sub 2 } starts to come out of solution, and fouling and impeller cavitation become imminent. The optimum pumping rate was found to be 1300 gpm (at 360 F density) and required that the Gravity <b>Head</b> <b>pump</b> impeller be set 2, 033 feet below grade. The required conventional plant pump setting was 1, 887 feet below grade, a depth which is probably at the practical limit for shaft-driven conventional pumps. Using the 1300 gpm, 360 F resource as a starting point, detailed cost estimates and performance calculations were made for the Gravity Head and various conventional alternative well-head systems. The most cost effective of the conventional alternatives was found to be a 700 psi cycle using R 114 as the working fluid (actually optimized at 682 psi). That system produced 3, 805 kW busbar net vs. 4, 995 kW busbar net for the Gravity Head unit. Since both the Gravity Head and conventional binary plant cost estimates for commercially mature units came out roughly equal, it was obvious that the Gravity Head system would produce more attractive financial returns [...] it became a question of degree. The study is in two parts. In Part I, emphasis is placed on the economic sensitivities of the compared systems to variations in capital cost, O&M cost, avoided energy inflation rates, and brine cost. In Part II, a somewhat more rigorous attempt is made to derive the actual economic performance of the systems under more realistic circumstances with contingencies, cost penalties, and multiple-unit developments added...|$|E
