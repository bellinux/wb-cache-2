5|$|During 2009, Ramsay had {{financial}} issues with tax payments. A liquidation petition was placed by HM Revenue and Customs against Plane Food, Maze, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and The Narrow. He was given {{two weeks to}} pay the tax debts accumulated by Plane Food. It was announced on 10 December that he had achieved this and the restaurant remained open. His 2010 opening, Bread Street Kitchen, {{was based on the}} same concept as Plane Food, as its location within the One New Change office and retail development created a similar need to cater <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> dining and a high volume of single diners.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London. The restaurant cost £2.5 {{million to build}} and due to its location within the airside area of the airport, there are restrictions {{on the use of}} gas and the types of cutlery which may be used. It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5, and with several other Ramsay-related openings that year. Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces, and menus are also offered <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal to be eaten on a plane.|$|E

Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended.

The Hokies' need <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> points was foiled by an injury to Druckenmiller, who left the game after throwing an incomplete pass on the first play of the drive. Backup quarterback Al Clark was unable to gain a first down, and neither was Druckenmiller, who {{returned to the}} game for third down. Tech punted back to Nebraska, which returned the kick to its 45-yard line.|$|E
5|$|By October28, Isabela, {{southern}} Cagayan, Quirino, {{and northern}} Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #3, the second-highest level. More than 20provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels. Residents living {{along the coast}} were urged to evacuate. Early on October29, several provinces along Luzon's east coast were placed under PSWS #4, {{the highest level of}} alert. During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo urged residents to heed warnings and not to venture out during the storm. Throughout Luzon, schools and government offices were closed on October29 while residents in mountainous areas were urged to evacuate due to threat of mudslides. The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> post-storm response. Hospitals in Cimaron's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients. Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment. Within evacuation areas, the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas. Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{was born}} in 1888 in Cardiff, Wales to a Welsh mother and Irish father. Dyer's mother came from a musical {{background}} {{and was a member}} of the Royal Welsh Glee, while his father was a bare knuckle boxer. Dyer showed promise as a baritone singer and was trained by Clara Novello Davies, mother of Ivor Novello. He was also an impressive sportsman, as a swimmer and, like his father, a boxer; but his family's poverty decreed that he took up boxing over his singing to provide an income. Dyer fought in the travelling show booths <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> money, but when this was discovered by the amateur boxing association, it led to him being stripped of his amateur status, which in turn saw his hopes of competing at the 1908 Summer Olympics in boxing and in swimming dashed.|$|E

5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services. Online multiplayer includes ranked matches, where players {{battle to}} increase their rank and ascend the game's leaderboards; player matches, which do not bestow rank and offer options <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> rematches; and player lobbies, which allow up to eight players in a single room {{to compete in a}} king of the hill-style format. When an online match begins, both players can view their opponent's License Card. License Cards keep track of players' tendencies based on fighting style, record player points and total number of wins and losses, and allow players to see the positive and negative points of their play styles. Included among the online features is Shadow Battle, a series of downloadable content packs that allow the player to fight against a team of AI-controlled opponents programmed after the techniques and preferences of Capcom's development staff and famous players from the fighting game community.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E

5|$|Red Dead Redemption is {{a western}} action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players control John Marston, and {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. Outside of missions, players may freely roam the open world. Players interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed {{in order to use}} them. Marston can utilize trains <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> travelling, but he can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting Johnson's vision <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> {{reconciliation}} with former Confederates, Congress passed three Reconstruction Acts over Johnson's vetoes, which divided {{the southern states}} into five military districts to protect the African Americans elected to political office and freedmen's rights generally. Republicans gained majorities in all 11 states, and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices. Military governors were to lead transitional state governments in each district. Grant selected the generals and supported the new law. Grant hoped that Reconstruction Acts would help pacify the South. By complying with the Acts and instructing his subordinates to do likewise, Grant further alienated Johnson. When Sheridan removed public officials in Louisiana who impeded Reconstruction, Johnson was displeased and sought Sheridan's removal; Grant recommended a rebuke, but not a dismissal. In 1867, Congress passed the third Reconstruction law, which gave Grant oversight over {{the enforcement of the}} Reconstruction Acts. The Army conducted new elections for constitutional conventions in the ex-Confederate states. They registered blacks to vote and in many places prevented from voting white men who had supported the Confederacy, as set out in the disenfranchisement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow <b>for</b> <b>quick</b> screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
