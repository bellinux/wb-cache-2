60|$|We {{have another}} {{instance}} of far-reaching {{agreement between the}} deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, and {{the general theory of}} relativity on the other. This agreement goes so far, that up to the preseat {{we have been able to}} find only a few deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of investigation, and to which the physics of pre-relativity days does not also lead, and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental assumptions of the two theories. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>follows,</b> <b>we</b> shall again consider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been obtained.|$|E
60|$|If {{the motion}} of the {{carriage}} is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The mechanical behaviour is {{different from that of the}} case previously considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity. But <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>follows</b> <b>we</b> shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained.|$|E

60|$|In after life, {{although}} {{we fail to}} trace its working, that name which careless godfathers lightly applied to your unconscious infancy will have been moulding your character, and influencing with irresistible power the whole course of your earthly fortunes. But the last name, overlooked by Mr. Shandy, is no whit less important {{as a condition of}} success. Family names, we must recollect, are but inherited nicknames; and if the sobriquet were applicable to the ancestor, it is most likely applicable to the descendant also. You would not expect to find Mr. M'Phun acting as a mute, or Mr. M'Lumpha excelling as a professor of dancing. Therefore, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>follows,</b> <b>we</b> shall consider names, independent of whether they are first or last. And to begin with, look what a pull Cromwell had over Pym--the one name full of a resonant imperialism, the other, mean, pettifogging, and unheroic to a degree. Who would expect eloquence from Pym--who would read poems by Pym--who would bow to the opinion of Pym? He might have been a dentist, but he should never have aspired to be a statesman. I can only wonder that he succeeded as he did. Pym and Habakkuk stand first upon the roll of men who have triumphed, by sheer force of genius, over the most unfavourable appellations. But even these have suffered; and, had they been more fitly named, the one might have been Lord Protector, and the other have shared the laurels with Isaiah. In this matter we must not forget that all our great poets have borne great names. Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Shelley--what a constellation of lordly words! Not a single common-place name among them--not a Brown, not a Jones, not a Robinson; they are all names that one would stop and look at on a door-plate. Now, imagine if Pepys had tried to clamber somehow into the enclosure of poetry, what a blot would that word have made upon the list! The thing was impossible. In the first place a certain natural consciousness that men would have held him down to the level of his name, would have prevented him from rising above the Pepsine standard, and so haply withheld him altogether from attempting verse. Next, the book-sellers would refuse to publish, and the world to read them, on the mere evidence of the fatal appellation. And now, before I close this section, I must say one word as to punnable names, names that stand alone, that have a significance and life apart from him that bears them. These are the bitterest of all. One friend of mine goes bowed and humbled through life under the weight of this misfortune; for it is an awful thing when a man's name is a joke, when he cannot be mentioned without exciting merriment, and when even the intimation of his death bids fair to carry laughter into many a home.|$|E

40|$|In this report, {{we present}} an impact {{assessment}} {{of a total of}} 439 SSH projects funded under FP 6 (last call) and FP 7 SSH in four domains: scientific, political, social and the promotion of the European Research Area. Scientific impact refers to the publications, citation patterns, and dissemination among scientific networks, as well as further research development. Political impact means the transfer of research outcomes and political recommendations into EU and national policies, and the use of research outcomes by civil society led or other entities in their political agendas. 1 Social impact occurs when there is evidence of social improvements in relation to the goals defined by legitimated political representatives which are the EU 2020 targets, the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, or now the Junker’s Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change, as the result of implementing research results. 2 IMPACT-EV is particularly interested in exploring the social impact that the research projects have obtained in relation to the EU 2020 targets (such as increased employment, reducing school dropout or reducing poverty rates) or the objectives of the Lisbon strategy. Finally, impact on strengthening ERA includes aspects such as mobility, training young researchers, interdisciplinarity, and international collaboration, among other related items. 3 Thus, this report has been conducted during the first 15 months of the project. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>follow,</b> <b>we</b> present general considerations and specific examples of the impacts of SSH in several fields, as well as a selection of those projects with the highest identified impact in each dimension...|$|R
