40|$|The work shows correct {{procedures}} {{needed in}} order to gather reliable data from measurement of displacements versus axial load in a laboratory mounting of the Ilizarov external fixator. The mechanism of settling after load cycling is investigated. <b>Detension</b> under load is a major problem of wires. By means of vibration frequency measurements, tests on single wire allow determination of reduction in wire tension due to transverse loading: it is found that, almost independently from the amount of clamp tightening, the tension reaches a lower limit related only to the transverse load and not related to pretension. It is shown that, for higher clamp tightening torques, wire <b>detension</b> must be attributed to permanent plastic deformation of the wires; moreover, it is shown that the unavoidable errors in the spacing of the tensioned wires lead to marked decrease of their stiffness under transverse loa...|$|E
40|$|In {{mountain}} region where sediment yield is very active, {{various kinds of}} sabo workshave been constructed to control or prevent sediment erosion, transportation and deposition. Debris dam, one of the typical sabo works, has functions inherently such as suppresion ofchannel erosion and sediment <b>detension</b> liable to flow out. But, no general method to evaluatethese functions have been established. The present study will discuss the functions of debrisdam with flume data, concentrating into the problems of erosion control. The eroding capacity of flow water depends on the shear stress distribution in streamwise. The shear stress, as well, is related to discharge, slope, stream geomorphology and soon. Flume experiments are carried out to evaluate the hydraulic quantities and channelvariations in both cases with and without debris dams. Eroding phenomena of channelsare discussed in the both cases, from a view point of sediment hydraulics. Then, the ex-perimental data are given to test the formulas for sediment transportation and side bankerosion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the hydrologic phenomena and characteristics of hydrologic processes such as rainfall, interception, infiltration, soil water and groundwater, and evaluate the relationship between rainfall and streamflow of a headwaters forested watershed in central Taiwan. The study area selected was the # 3 experimental watershed in Lien-hua-chi Branch, Forestry Research Institute (TFRI) of the Council of Agriculture, located in Nantou county, central Taiwan. The data obtained from hydrometelogic stations maintained by the Forestry Research Institute and additional instruments installed in the field for measuring soil water, groundwater level, and related hydrologic properties were used in required analyses for this study. These instruments include pressure sensors at each of 6 selected wells and also 6 pressure sensors near the hydrometric weir (right side # 2, # 3, # 10, left side # 4, # 5, # 6) to record groundwater levels and conduct slug tests for the aquifer saturated conductivity calculation. In addition, one Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) each at 3 different depths of 15 cm, 30 cm, and 45 cm below the ground surface were installed to measure soil water in different depths at sites near the 6 monitoring wells. Guelph infiltration test was conducted at every site. Surface saturated conductivity values were calculated with 4 different methods. The results from this study were summarized according to the sequence of water cycle processes of forested watershed as follows: The interception by tree-crown was the first hydrological phenomenon after rainfall events in a forested watershed. The relationship between rainfall and interception per rainfall event showed at the # 3 experimental watershed in Lien-hua-chi the ratio of interception loss decreases with increasing rainfall intensity. The through-fall will generally not occur before the accumulated rainfall amount exceeding 1 mm. The annual interception loss was 11. 3 % of the annual rainfall amount. The infiltration rates of the soils at 6 sites adjacent to monitoring wells in # 3 experimental watershed of Lien-hua-chi range between 86 ~ 486 mm/hr. The final infiltration rates at these 6 sites all were greater than the one hour rainfall intensity of 25 year return period with the exception of extremely high intensity rainfall over 100 mm/hr brought by Typhoon Toraji. Therefore, overland stormflow rarely take place. Horton's stormflow generation theory assumes the stormflows during Typhoon Toraji at # 3 Lien-hua-chi experimental watershed were contributed completely by the overland flow then the calculated final infiltration rate would be as low as 6. 14 mm/hr. This value was much lower than the final infiltration rates measured at the # 3 experimental watershed. This suggests that overland flow is not very likely to take place in the # 3 experimental watershed. Field observations also indicate that overland flow rarely occur in a watershed with good forest cover like the Lien-hua-chi # 3 experimental watershed. Rainwater generally infiltrates into soil and become soil water after arriving ground surface. Hydrologic conductivity is important in determining the movement of the water in soil. In this study, Guelph parametered test method was used to measure infiltration. Phillip equation, accumulated infiltration curve fitting, recovery test and slug test were applied to calculate hydrologic conductivity for surface soils. The time of water reaching each soil depth was calculated using Darcy's law. The results were compared to field measurements with TDR. The results showed that among 4 methods the times needed to reach specific depths calculated with conductivity using accumulated infiltration curve fitting method were closest to field measurement values. Part of the rainfalls infiltrated into soil enter retension storage and become the source for plant evapotranspiration; while another part of water in the soil become soil <b>detension</b> storage as the source of streamflow in the rainless period. The results of field measurement in this study did not find that after rainfall soil water increased orderly from surface downward. Instead, the soil water in 45 cm depth showed the most earlier and rapid increase. This indicates that rainfall might had by-passed the 15, 30 cm depths and move rapidly to 45 cm in the # 3 experimental watershed. This might be caused by soil piping which mainly formed from rotten root. Furthermore, the groundwater measurements showed that the water needed 7 - 9 hours to move down to 15 m depth aquifer and became sources of during streamflow rainless period. The most important factor affecting the amounts and characteristics of streamflow was rainfall. In this study, it was discovered that there were very close relationships between ○１ annual rainfall and annual streamflow, ○２ seasonal rainfall and seasonal streamflow, and ○３ storm rainfall and stormflow in Lien-hua-chi # 3 experimental watershed. Annual rainfall and annual streamflow had the highest correlation. Seasonal rainfall and streamflow for the period May - September had the second highest correlation. In this study, 16 rainfall events were chosen from # 3 experimental watershed for evaluating the relations between storm rainfall and stormflow amounts. The total rainfall amounts were between 25 - 371. 5 mm and the average was 132. 63 mm. Barnes's method and Hewlett's method were applied in separating stormflow hydrograph for stormflow and hydrologic response ratio calculations. The calculated stormflow range between 1. 5 - 190 mm and average 31. 37 mm by Barnes method, and range between 0. 23 - 245. 59 mm and 42. 92 mm average by Hewlett method. Hydrologic response ratios (SF/P) were between 2. 81 % ~ 51. 22 % averaging 15. 14 %, and between 0. 1 % - 98 % averaging 29. 0 % respectively with Barnes's and Hewlett's methods. The peak flows are governed by the rainfall amount, intensity and duration. In No. 3 watershed, the instantaneous storm peak flow of 10, 25 and 100 years return period were 10. 8, 12. 5 and 16. 0 (m 3 /s/km 2). According to the results of this study, the proportion and characteristics of streamflow were mainly determined by characteristic of rainfall events. The results of this study reveal that even in the headwaters watershed like Lien-hua-chi # 3 experimental watershed with very good forest cover, the extreme typhoon rainstorm can still cause extremely high hydrologic response ratios and specific peak flows. This strongly suggests that the capabilities of forest in regulating streamflow are significant but have limits. 本研究旨在探討天然森林集水區生態系水循環中降雨、截留、入滲、土壤水分儲存及移動、地下水等各項目之現象和特性，及降雨與溪流量之關係，以闡明森林集水區保育經營所需的學理基礎。本研究以位於台灣中部南投縣之農委會林業試驗所在蓮華池研究中心之第 3 號試驗集水區為研究區域。 本研究所需資料除林業試驗所所收集的降雨及流量外，並現場裝置儀器量測土壤水分、地下水位及相關土壤水文性質。首先在研究集水區內分別在靠近量水堰溪流左、右兩岸各三口井（右岸＃ 10 、＃ 3 、＃ 2 ；左岸＃ 4 、＃ 5 、＃ 6 ）裝設有壓力式水位計一支，用以紀錄井內水位變化及進行微水試驗，以求算含水層之飽和水力傳導係數；並在 6 口觀測井附近土壤地表下 15 cm、 30 cm、 45 cm深度加設三支時域反射儀（TDR），量測不同深度之土壤水分，以及在各量測點進行Guelph土壤入滲試驗，用四種不同方法求算接近地表之土壤飽和水力傳導度。 本研究之結果，依森林集水區水循環過程之順序摘要如下： 樹冠的截留是降雨落到森林集水區後最先發生的水文現象，截留量與降雨量呈半對數型態的關係，而截留損失比與降雨強度成反比的關係，降雨量超過 1 mm後才會有穿落量。平均年降雨量中有 11. 3 ％為截留損失。 本研究在蓮華池 3 號試驗集水區 6 口觀測井附近地表土壤量測所得之最終入滲率在 86. 4 - 486 mm/hr之間，只有在類似桃芝颱風所帶來非常高降雨強度（大於 100 mm/hr）時才有可能發生漫地流。Horton的逕流產生理論假設 3 號試驗集水區在桃芝颱風期間內所有暴雨流出量皆來自漫地流，則可反算出土壤最終入滲率為 6. 14 mm/hr，遠低於本集水區所有量測點實際所得之最終入滲率，因此可反證 3 號試驗集水區很少發生漫地流。暴雨期間多次現場勘查亦未發現有漫地流發生。此結果顯示在森林覆蓋良好的集水區內漫地流發生的機會很低。 降雨穿過集水區樹冠而到達地表之後，經由入滲進入土壤成為土壤水分，水力傳導度為影響水分移動的重要土壤水文特性，本研究以Guelph滲透儀方法量測入滲率，並利用菲力普公式、累積入滲量曲線擬合、回復試驗及微水試驗等方式，求算接近地表之土壤之飽和水力傳導度。並應用Darcy定律計算水分到達各土壤深度的時間。和用TDR實際量測水分到達各土壤深度時間作比較，結果顯示以累積入滲量曲線擬合方式所得之水力傳導度計算出水分移動的時間與實際測得之時間最接近。 滲入土壤的雨水有一部分補足土壤的儲留保蓄，供植物蒸發散使用，另一部分雨水則成為土壤滯留保蓄，是不下雨期間溪流量的來源。本研究土壤水分量測結果發現降雨期間土壤水分並未因入滲雨水而有由上而下依序增加的現象，但 45 cm深度之土壤水分含量卻急遽增加，顯示 3 號試驗集水區土壤有因節理或樹根腐爛所造成的通道（soil pipes），使雨水快速超越 15 cm、 30 cm下移至 45 cm深土壤之現象。此外，地下水量測結果顯示土壤水分向下移動大約需 7 - 9 小時後才到達約 15 m深之集水區含水層，成為森林集水區不下雨期間溪流量的來源。 降雨量是影響溪流量的最主要因子，本研究結果顯示蓮華池 3 號試驗集水區其年雨量-年流量，季節雨量-季節流量及暴雨量-暴雨流出量等關係都非常密切，在各項降雨量與溪流量特性的關係中，以年降雨量與年溪流量的關係最佳，乾、濕季降雨量與溪流量之關係次之。本研究從近年來的資料中選出 16 場暴雨流出量事件，探討其降雨-暴雨流出量關係， 16 場降雨其總平均降雨量為 132. 63 mm，降雨量在 25 至 371. 5 mm之間，暴雨流出量應用潘斯法（Barnes）及Hewlett法作水文歷線分離，分離出暴雨流出量潘斯法為 1. 5 - 190 mm之間，平均為 31. 37 mm，Hewlett法則在 0. 23 - 245. 59 mm之間，平均值為 42. 92 mm。以暴雨流出量和降雨總量計算出的水文反應比（SF/P）潘斯法在 2. 81 ％至 51. 22 ％之間，平均為 15. 14 ％，即平均有 15. 14 ％的降雨量成為暴雨流出量。Hewlett法則在 0. 1 - 98 ％之間，平均值為 29. 0 ％，顯示出降雨量平均約有 29 ％成為暴雨流出量。最大瞬時洪峰流量的大小則主要是因為每年最大暴雨的總量、強度與延時而異， 3 號試驗集水區在 10 、 25 、 100 年不同重現期之洪峰流量分別為 10. 8 、 12. 5 、 16. 0 (m 3 /s/km 2) 。本研究結果顯示，溪流量大小和特性主要受降雨特性影響，在總量大和強度高的颱風暴雨，即使是森林覆蓋非常良好的 3 號試驗集水區，其水文反應比和單位面積洪峰流量都非常高，此說明森林對調節流量大小的功能有其限度。摘要 …………………………………………………………………………Ⅰ ABSTRACT ……………………………………………………………………Ⅴ 目錄 …………………………………………………………………………Ⅷ 圖目錄 ………………………………………………………………………Ⅹ 表目錄 ……………………………………………………………………ⅩⅣ 符號對照表…………………………………………………………………ⅩⅤ 第一章 緒論 ……………………………………………………………… 1 第 1 - 1 節 前言 ………………………………………………………………… 1 第 1 - 2 節 研究動機及目的 …………………………………………………… 2 第 1 - 3 節 研究流程 …………………………………………………………… 3 第二章 文獻回顧 ………………………………………………………… 5 第 2 - 1 節 森林集水區水文特性 ……………………………………………… 5 第 2 - 2 節 降雨特性 …………………………………………………………… 6 第 2 - 3 節 截留 ………………………………………………………………… 7 第 2 - 4 節 滲透 ………………………………………………………………… 8 第 2 - 5 節 土壤水分…………………………………………………………… 10 第 2 - 6 節 地下水……………………………………………………………… 11 第 2 - 7 節 降雨與溪流量關係………………………………………………… 13 第三章 研究材料與方法 ……………………………………………… 15 第 3 - 1 節 研究集水區………………………………………………………… 16 3 - 1 - 1. 位置、地形………………………………………………………… 16 3 - 1 - 2. 地質………………………………………………………………… 19 3 - 1 - 3. 土壤………………………………………………………………… 21 3 - 1 - 4. 水文氣象…………………………………………………………… 21 第 3 - 2 節 分析方法…………………………………………………………… 24 3 - 2 - 1. 降雨強度-延時-頻率（IDF）分析………………………………… 26 3 - 2 - 2. 降雨與截留………………………………………………………… 26 3 - 2 - 3. 降雨與土壤水分…………………………………………………… 27 3 - 2 - 4. 降雨與地下水……………………………………………………… 33 3 - 2 - 5. 降雨與溪流量……………………………………………………… 34 第四章 結果與討論 …………………………………………………… 40 第 4 - 1 節 降雨特性…………………………………………………………… 40 第 4 - 2 節 截留損失量………………………………………………………… 44 第 4 - 3 節 降雨強度、滲透能與漫地流 …………………………………… 48 第 4 - 4 節 土壤水分儲存與移動……………………………………………… 65 第 4 - 5 節 地下水特性………………………………………………………… 82 第 4 - 6 節 洪峰流量與低水流量 …………………………………………… 103 第 4 - 7 節 降雨與溪流量關係 ……………………………………………… 105 4 - 7 - 1. 平均降雨量與溪流量 …………………………………………… 105 4 - 7 - 2. 暴雨量及暴雨流出量 …………………………………………… 121 第五章 結論與建議…………………………………………………… 148 參考文獻 …………………………………………………………………… 152 附錄 ………………………………………………………………………… 162 附錄A. 微水試驗及回復試驗之分析方法………………………………… 162 A- 1. 微水試驗分析 ……………………………………………………… 162 A- 2. 回復試驗分析 ……………………………………………………… 166 附錄B. 數據單位及相對高程轉換………………………………………… 177 附錄C. 桃芝颱風期間雨量、流量及地下水位之原始資料……………… 184 附錄D. 桃芝颱風期間右岸土壤水分之原始資料………………………… 187 附錄E. 桃芝颱風期間左岸土壤水分之原始資料………………………… 190 附錄F.

Two types of prestressed beams were monitored, two TY 7 internal beams and two TYE 7 edge beams. The beams incorporated high strength (up to 90. 7 MPa) self-consolidating concrete. The entire manufacturing process which included early-age curing and the <b>detensioning</b> process was captured in great detail using the installed FOS system. An analysis of the curing strains within the beams revealed the significant effect that ambient temperature, curing duration, and formwork restraint has on the development of prestress losses prior to <b>detensioning.</b> Based on the distributed FOS readings, it was observed that the strain remained uniform {{along the length of the}} beams during the various beam monitoring stages. The measured strain data was then used to calculate prestress losses in the first six months after casting (prior to casting of the in-situ concrete bridge deck). The TY 7 and TYE 7 beams experienced losses that were 79 % and 72 % of the ultimate losses predicted using Eurocode 2 equations, respectively.

40|$|Pretensioned {{prestressed}} concrete {{can be produced}} {{in a number of}} ways. Among them several options can be considered depending on the structure constructed and how prestress is transferred. In the recent times radial and longitudinal cracks have been observed due to high tensile stresses developed in concrete around prestressing steel. In practice to eliminate these harmful conditions modifications are required to ensure serviceability functions of the composite high quality material. Often excessive prestress is reduced by lowering the tensile stress in the prestressing steel or / and the magnitude of the eccentricity {{towards the end of the}} member which in vulnerable to this type of effect. In the global context debonding of tendons towards the end of a member, drapping of tendon towards the central portion of the member or controlled <b>detensioning</b> can be applied to achieve the desire outcomes. All these techniques require a sound basis for prestress transfer which is achieved by bond. Some of the practices are prohibitive to developing countries due to the high cost of holding down devices buried in the concrete. Further in third world countries cost of hardware is expensive as opposed to cheep labour encountered in production. This research is aimed at strengtheni~g our understanding of bond mechanism by extending cohesive cracking approach established by experiment and matched by a sound theoretical basis to complement each other. Currently some of the global practices are carried out by relying on. intuition as opposed to theoretical formulations. This study covers a 'comprehensive analysis of bond development for the controlled <b>detensioned</b> process. The experimental verification is not part of the present scope. However the parameters influencing such as strand diameter, initial prestress, concrete strength and cover or half the spacing have been identified as main influences to ascertain bond strength based on available test results exhumed from literature.

However hammer fired semi-auto pistols have a beaver tail to protect the shooters hand from the slide which makes it more difficult (as opposed to a double action/single action revolver) to securely and firmly grasp the hammer with the thumb thus making an accidental discharge more likely. Striker-fired pistols on the other hand do not have a hammer so the only way to return the trigger to its longer pull (safer) state is by means of a decocking or rather <b>detensioning</b> lever which actually releases the tension in the striker's spring without allowing firing pin full travel and internal safeties disengagement (such as firing pin block which these types of firearms are generally fitted with).

Robust fibre Bragg grating strain and temperature sensor arrays were developed specifically for this application and were designed for long-term monitoring of sleeper performance. The sensors were used to monitor sleeper production and to help gain {{a deeper understanding of}} their early-age behaviour which can highly influence long-term performance. In total, 12 sleepers were instrumented and strain data were collected during the entire manufacturing process including concrete casting and curing, prestressing strand <b>detensioning</b> and qualification testing. Following the production process, sleepers were stored temporarily and monitored for 4 [*]months until being placed in service. The monitoring results highlight the intrinsic variability in strain development among identical sleepers, despite high levels of production quality control. Using prestress loss as a quality control indicator, the integrated sensing system demonstrated that sleepers were performing within Eurocode-based design limits prior to being placed in service. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model was developed to provide additional insight into the sleepers’ early-age behaviour.

40|$|University of Cambridge There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} new materials in construction. Materials such as fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs) are lightweight, strong, and, for the most part, non-corrodible. Hence, the use of FRPs as prestressing tendons for concrete represents a viable, durable alternative to conventional practice using prestressing steel. This paper addresses the nature of the bond between an FRP tendon and concrete in the transfer zone of a pretensioned concrete beam. In particular, two different types of aramid fibre-reinforced plastics (AFRPs) are considered. In the experimental investigation, the tendon pull-in behaviour during <b>detensioning</b> of a number of small-scale (100 3 200 3 2800 mm) pretensioned concrete beams was monitored. These results were then used to make inferences about the bond stress distribution through the transfer zone. Both a constant and a non-linear relation-ship between the bond shear stress and the tendon slip were considered and the transfer behaviour of the two types of AFRP and steel were compared. It was found that by assuming a non-uniform bond stress distribution some interesting results about the distinctly different natures of the bond behaviour of the three materials were obtained.

PetermanA {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of different concrete properties and prestressing steel indentation types on development length and flexural capacity of pretensioned members. Wires and strands commonly used in the manufacturing of prestressed concrete railroad ties worldwide were selected for the study. Thirteen different 5. 32 -mm-diameter prestressing wire types and six different strands (four, seven-wire strands and two, three-wire strands) were used to cast prisms with a square cross section. The ratio of concrete to prestressed steel in the test prism’s cross section was representable of typical concrete railroad ties. Thus, geometrical and mechanical properties of test prisms were representative of actual ties in the railroad industry. To understand the effect of concrete-release strengths and slumps on development length, all parameters were kept constant in the prisms except concrete-release strength and slump. To manufacture prisms with different release strengths, all four wires/strands were pulled and <b>detensioned</b> gradually when the concrete compressive strength reached 3500 (24. 13 MPa), 4500 (31. 03 MPa), and 6000 (41. 37 MPa) psi. To determine the effect of different slumps on development length, prisms with different slumps of 3 in. (7. 6 cm), 6 in. (15. 2 cm), and 9 in. (22. 9 cm) were manufactured and all other parameters were kept constant in prisms. All prisms were tested in three-point bending at different spans to obtain estimations of development length based on type of reinforcement, concrete-release strength, and concrete slump. Lastly, a design equation was developed based on experimental data for prediction of development length. In the last phase of load tests, cyclic-loading tests were conducted on the prisms manufactured with wires to evaluate the bond performance of wires with different indentation types under cyclic loading. A total of 210 load tests, including 14 cyclic tests, were conducted. The monotonic-load tests revealed a large difference in the development length of pretensioned concrete members manufactured with different wire/strand types and different concrete-release strengths. Also, the cyclic-load tests revealed a significant difference in bond performance of different wire types under cyclic loading compared to monotonic loading...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{prestressed}} concrete panels {{have been used}} as subdecks in bridge construction in Iowa and other states. To investigate the performance of these types of composite slabs at locations adjacent to abutment and pier diaphragms in skewed bridges, a research prcject which involved surveys of design agencies and precast producers, field inspections of existing bridges, analytical studies, and experimental testing was conducted. The survey results from the design agencies and panel producers showed that standardization of precast panel construction would be desirable, that additional inspections at the precast plant and at the bridge site would be beneficial, and that some form of economical study should be undertaken to determine actual cost savings associated with composite slab construction. Three bridges in Hardin County, Iowa were inspected to observe general geometric relationships, construction details, and to note the visual condition of the bridges. Hairline cracks beneath several of the prestressing strands in many of the precast panels were observed, and a slight discoloration of the concrete was seen beneath most of the strands. Also, some rust staining was visible at isolated locations on several panels. Based on the findings of these inspections, future inspections are recommended to monitor the condition of these and other bridges constructed with precast panel subdecks. Five full-scale composite slab specimens were constructed in the Structural Engineering Laboratory at Iowa State University. One specimen modeled bridge deck conditions which are not adjacent to abutment or pier diaphragms, and the other four specimens represented the geometric conditions which occur for skewed diaphragms of 0, 15, 30, and 40 degrees. The specimens were subjected to wheel loads of service and factored level magnitudes at many locations on the slab surface and to concentrated loads which produced failure of the composite slab. The measured slab deflections and bending strains at both service and factored load levels compared reasonably well with the results predicted by simplified Finite element analyses of the specimens. To analytically evaluate the nominal strength for a composite slab specimen, yield-line and punching shear theories were applied. Yield-line limit loads were computed using the crack patterns generated during an ultimate strength test. In most cases, these analyses indicated that the failure mode was not flexural. Since the punching shear limit loads in most instances were close to the failure loads, and since the failure surfaces immediately adjacent to the wheel load footprint appeared to be a truncated prism shape, the probable failure mode for all of the specimens was punching shear. The development lengths for the prestressing strands in the rectangular and trapezoidal shaped panels was qualitatively investigated by monitoring strand slippage at the ends of selected prestressing strands. The initial strand transfer length was established experimentally by monitoring concrete strains during strand <b>detensioning,</b> and this length was verified analytically by a finite element analysis. Even though the computed strand embedment lengths in the panels were not sufficient to fully develop the ultimate strand stress, sufficient stab strength existed. Composite behavior for the slab specimens was evaluated by monitoring slippage between a panel and the topping slab and by computation of the difference in the flexural strains between the top of the precast panel and the underside of the topping slab at various locations. Prior to the failure of a composite slab specimen, a localized loss of composite behavior was detected. The static load strength performance of the composite slab specimens significantly exceeded the design load requirements. Even with skew angles of up to 40 degrees, the nominal strength of the slabs {{did not appear to be}} affected when the ultimate strength test load was positioned on the portion of each slab containing the trapezoidal-shaped panel. At service and factored level loads, the joint between precast panels did not appear to influence the load distribution along the length of the specimens. Based on the static load strength of the composite slab specimens, the continued use of precast panels as subdecks in bridge deck construction is recommended...|$|R
