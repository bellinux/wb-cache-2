A thin-walled square tube is designed by use of a double deck square tube with clapboards which has a stable structure with less Euler deformation in <b>front</b> <b>impact.</b> More deformations of extensional collapse in the double deck square tube with clapboards improve the performance of structures for energy absorption. Induced slots are employed in the square tube to decrease the peak acceleration in <b>front</b> <b>impact.</b> Collision process can be controlled by the slots for the stable deformation and reduced initial peak acceleration...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Introduction/Objective Motor vehicle {{collisions}} (MVC) are {{the leading}} cause of bladder injury in the United States. The National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS), a national population based sample, was used to investigate sources of bladder injury following frontal impact and side impact MVC. Methods We queried the NASS-CDS database from 2000 - 2008. Possible predictors included primary direction of force, general area of damage, speed change at impact (delta v), seatbelt use, airbag deployment, sex, injury severity score, pelvic Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and specific interior compartment sources. Backward stepwise logistic regression was utilized to assess important predictor variables as a cause of bladder injury following MVC. Final analyses accounted for sampling weights so that odd ratio estimates would be generalizable to the population. Age < 16, rollover MVCs, ejected passengers, and backseat occupants were excluded from analysis. Results After applying sampling weights, 39, 721, 871 occupants were available for analysis in NASS-CDS. Of these, 5, 780 occupants had a bladder injury that allowed determination of frontal or side impact MVC. More injuries were due to <b>front</b> <b>impact</b> (3, 155) than side impact (2, 625). Following <b>front</b> <b>impact</b> MVC, pelvic AIS (OR 8. 52, 95 %CI 4. 21, 17. 25) and the restraint system (OR 7. 64, 95 %CI 1. 17, 49. 89) were significant predictor variables for bladder injury. Among left (driver) side MVCs, pelvic AIS (OR 5. 40, 95 %CI 3. 84, 7. 59), ISS (1. 06, 95 %CI 1. 04, 1. 08) and the restraint system (4. 11, 95 %CI 1. 50, 11. 25) were the only variables that significantly predicted bladder injury. Among right side MVCs, the pelvic AIS (OR 8. 72, 95 %CI 5. 98, 12. 70) was the only variable that statistically predicted a bladder injury. Conclusion Exploratory analysis reveals there to be significant differences in the internal design elements of automobiles that are associated with bladder injury after MVC.

When compared to estimated injury thresholds, the results demonstrated that an increase in lateral translation or a decrease in neck compliance resulted in a significant decrease in the risk of head injury as reflected by peak linear and angular accelerations...|$|R
