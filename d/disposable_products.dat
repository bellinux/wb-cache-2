25|$|Historically, {{financial}} {{motivation was}} one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of <b>disposable</b> <b>products</b> has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{method of}} waste management is {{the prevention of}} waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using <b>disposable</b> <b>products</b> (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material {{to achieve the same}} purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).|$|E

50|$|A bag {{may or may}} not be {{disposable}}; however, even {{a disposable}} bag can often be used many times, for economic and environmental reasons. On the other hand, there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a garbage bag is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a <b>disposable</b> <b>product</b> is often disposed of when it is empty. Similarly, bags used as receptacles in medical procedures, such as the colostomy bag used to collect waste from a surgically diverted biological system, are typically disposed of as medical waste. Many snack foods, such as pretzels, cookies, and potato chips, are available in disposable single-use sealed bags.|$|R

5000|$|A {{disposable}} (also called <b>disposable</b> <b>product)</b> is {{a product}} designed for a single use after which it is recycled or is disposed as solid waste. The term often implies cheapness and short-term convenience rather than medium to long-term durability. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar products that last indefinitely (e.g. washable air filters). The word [...] "disposables" [...] {{is not to be}} confused with the word [...] "consumables" [...] which is widely used in the mechanical world. In welding for example, welding rods, tips, nozzles, gas, etc. are considered to be [...] "consumables" [...] as they only last a certain amount of time before needing to be replaced.|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} and popularity of these toys {{has followed the}} development of superabsorbent polymers. In the early 1970s, the super absorbent polymer was used commercially {{for the first time}} for <b>disposable</b> hygienic <b>products.</b> The first product markets were feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products. The development of super absorbent technology and performance has been largely led by demands in the disposable hygiene segment. Strides in absorption performance have allowed the development of the ultra-thin baby diaper which uses a fraction of the materials - particularly fluff pulp - that earlier disposable diapers consumed. Over the years, technology has progressed so that there is little if any starch-grafted super absorbent polymer used in <b>disposable</b> hygienic <b>products.</b> These super absorbents typically are cross-linked acrylic homo-polymers (usually sodium neutralized).|$|R

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how a retailer’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and image influence consumer perceptions regarding the firm’s social responsibility, and how CSR aspects influence consumers buying decisions in store for a specific product. Design/methodology/approach– A qualitative case study method is used, including interviews, document studies and observations. The CSR approach of a Swedish retailer is investigated at corporate level and in the store, and how this interacts with the views of consumers as they make decisions regarding the purchase of a <b>disposable</b> <b>product.</b> Findings– The authors propose the concept CSR identity to capture the internal efforts and positioning that a retailer attempts to achieve. Store activities and external independent stakeholders will have a main influence on whether the identity is regarded as credible by consumers. Furthermore, factors such as self-image and influences from the social network will influence whether a consumer will be committed to prioritize CSR aspects in the store. Practical implications– Gaps between the retailer and the consumer perspective on CSR, particularly relevant for <b>disposable,</b> low-involvement <b>products</b> are identified. It is critical for retailers to be aware of and address these gaps. Originality/value– The study captures corporate level, store level and consumer behaviour for a single retailer and is able to reflect upon how specific activities from the retailer interact with consumer attitudes and activities in the store. The authors connect various streams of research on CSR and retailing into one consistent framework...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss the {{relation}} between the contemporary use and advertising of pharmaceutical drugs based on the so-called culture of consumption. We discuss advertising as a means of strengthening the belief in the power of these drugs, presenting them as a synthesis of science and technology to promote health and well being and, particularly, as a quick solution for typical problems of the contemporary world. The obligation to buy the latest medicines is becoming a symbol of social affirmation as well as the only way to weaken our daily problems. Using a logic of consumption as ownership, we create, with the help of advertising, a world of promises concerning immediate solutions, easily sold through on line shopping, supermarkets, department stores and shopping centers. We discuss this set of contemporary practices and values which are turning our way of life into a <b>disposable</b> <b>product.</b>   Keywords: advertising; consumption; pharmaceutical drugs...|$|R
