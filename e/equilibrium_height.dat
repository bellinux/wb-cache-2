Models of coastal dunes suggest that their final <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> is related to the distance between the water line and where vegetation can grow. Additionally the height of coastal dunes is impacted by storm events, which can erode dunes. Recent work has suggested that coastal dunes tend to evolve toward a high or low morphology depending on the growth rate of dunes relative to storm frequency. In certain conditions, both low and high dunes are possible — dunes are a system that shows bistable dynamics.|$|E

In this study, an attempt has been made to study the influence of certain parameters on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> attained by the liquid in the micro channel. Lucas Washburn equation has been modified using the concept of phase change and vapour recoil and also accommodating the entrance effects in terms of added mass. The formulated governing equation was used to study the effect of parameters such as: phase change, aspect ratio and properties of the liquid numerically using MATLAB. Two different liquids water and ether has been used in the analysis. It was found that phase change by evaporation resulted in lowering of liquid rise. Also the oscillations in water were found to be damped more than those in ether. It was also revealed that liquid rise increased with increasing aspect ratio and with increase in aspect ratio, the change in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> gradually decreased.

This approach is preliminarily validated with comparisons of deduced equivalent winds with the measurements from the Fabry-Perot interferometer, the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar and with previous works.

The deduced VEWs show large day-to-day variations during the winter, even in low magnetic activity conditions. The diurnal pattern of average VEWs is more complicated than that predicted by the empirical Horizontal Wind Model (HWM). Using an empirical electric field model based on the observations from Jicamarca radar and satellites, we investigate the contributions to VEWs from neutral winds and from electric fields at the F-layer peak.

We perform similar simulations. Particles heavier than the fluid are initially placed in a closely packed ordered configuration {{at the bottom of}} a periodic channel. The fluid-particle mixture is driven by an external pressure gradient. The particles are suspended or fluidized by lift forces that balance the buoyant weight perpendicular to the flow. Pressure waves corresponding to the waves at the fluid-mixture interface are observed. During the initial transient, these waves grow, resulting in bed erosion. At sufficiently large shear Reynolds numbers the particles occupy the entire channel width during the transient. The particle bed eventually settles to an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> which increases as the shear Reynolds number is increased. Heavier particles are lifted to a smaller <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> at the same Reynolds number. A correlation for the lift-off of many particles is obtained from the numerical data. The correlation is used to estimate the critical shear Reynolds number for lift-off of many particles. The critical shear Reynolds number for lift-off of a single particle is found to be greater than that for many particles. The procedures used here to obtain correlations from direct simulations in 2 D and the type of correlations that emerge should generalize to 3 D simulations presently underway...|$|E

We find that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> of the flux rope is approximately a power-law function of the relative strength of the background field. Our simulations indicate that the flux rope can escape more easily from a weaker background field. This further confirms the catastrophe in the magnetic configuration of interest can be triggered by decrease of strength of the background field. Our results show that it takes some time to reach internal equilibrium depending on the initial state of the flux rope. The plasma flow inside the flux rope due to the adjustment for the internal equilibrium of the flux rope remains small and does not last very long when the initial state of the flux rope commences from the stable branch of the theoretical equilibrium curve. This work also confirms the influence of the initial radius of flux rope on its evolution, the results indicate that the flux rope with larger initial radius erupts more easily.

40|$|Single-layer {{graphene}} exhibits exceptional {{mechanical properties}} attractive for optomechanics: it combines low mass density, large tensile modulus, and low bending stiffness. However, at visible wavelengths, graphene absorbs weakly and reflects even less, thereby inadequate to generate large optical forces needed in optomechanics. Here, we numerically {{show that a}} single-layer graphene sheet is sufficient to produce strong optical forces under terahertz or infrared illumination. For a system as simple as graphene suspended atop a uniform substrate, high reflectivity from the substrate is crucial in creating a standing-wave pattern, leading to a strong optical force on graphene. This force is readily tunable in amplitude and direction by adjusting the suspension height. In particular, repellent optical forces can levitate graphene {{to a series of}} stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>heights</b> above the substrate.

For hydrogen the addition of a third cluster layer stabilizes the results considerably. Both hydrogen and oxygen are adsorbed at (or close to) the four-fold hollow site. The calculated barriers for surface migration are also in good agreement with the experimental estimates.

40|$|AbstractThe {{characterization}} of a dielectrophoretic/gravitational field-flow-fractionation (DEP/G-FFF) system using model polystyrene (PS) microbeads is presented. Separations of PS beads of different surface functionalization (COOH and none) and different sizes (6, 10, and 15 μm in diameter) are demonstrated. To investigate the factors influencing separation performance, particle elution times were determined {{as a function}} of particle suspension conductivity, fluid flow rate, and applied field frequency and voltage. Experimental data were analyzed using a previously reported theoretical model and good agreement between theory and experiment was found. It was shown that separation of PS beads was based on the differences in their effective dielectric properties. Particles possessing different dielectric properties were positioned at different heights in a fluid-flow profile in a thin chamber by the balance of DEP and gravitational forces, transported at different velocities {{under the influence of the}} fluid flow, and thereby separated. To explore hydrodynamic (HD) lift effects, velocities of PS beads were determined {{as a function of}} fluid flow rate in the separation chamber when no DEP field was applied. In this case, particle <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> positions were governed solely by the balance of HD lift and gravitational forces. It was concluded that under the experimental conditions reported here, the DEP force was the dominant factor in controlling particle <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height</b> and that HD lift force played little role in DEP/G-FFF operation.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{measuring}} the compressive strength of strong particulate gels are available, including the centrifuge method, whereby the strength {{as a function of}} volume-fraction is obtained parametrically from the dependence of <b>equilibrium</b> sediment <b>height</b> upon acceleration. The analysis used conventionally due to Buscall & White (1987) ignores the possibility that the particulate network might adhere to the walls of the centrifuge tube, even though many types of cohesive particulate gel can be expected to. The neglect of adhesion is justifiable when the ratio of the shear to compressive strength is small, which it can be for many systems away from the gel-point, but never very near it. The errors arising from neglect of adhesion are investigated theoretically and quantified by synthesising <b>equilibrium</b> sediment <b>height</b> versus acceleration data for various degrees of adhesion and then analysing them in the conventional manner. Approximate correction factors suggested by dimensionless analysis are then tested. The errors introduced by certain other approximations made routinely in order to render the data-inversion practicable are analysed too.

40|$|The {{vertical}} dispersion of fluid particles in stably stratified homogeneous turbulence with mean shear is investigated. An analysis framework which describes the associated flow energetics in the Lagrangian frame is developed. This {{provides a more}} clear and consistent interpretation {{of the behavior of}} the mean square vertical displacement which can be related to the total potential energy (TPE) of a given set of fluid particles. The analysis considers TPE in terms of the available potential energy (APE), associated with the nonequilibrium displacement, and the reference potential energy (RPE), associated with the change in particle <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height,</b> i. e., the equilibrium displacement. The corresponding evolution equations describe the key sequence of processes. As fluid particles move away from their <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height,</b> vertical kinetic energy is converted (reversibly) to APE. This establishes nonequilibrium displacement and increases TPE. Without molecular diffusion, gravity will reduce the vertical velocity and the particle will eventually return to its original equilibrium height; APE is converted back to KE in this reversible process. With molecular diffusion, fluid particles will change their density, and therefore their <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height,</b> such to reduce density fluctuation; i. e., some of the APE will be dissipated and converted to RPE. Thus, molecular diffusion acts to preserve displacements and reduce the reconversion of PE to KE. In this manner, fluid particles can move further away from their original equilibrium level and the mean square vertical displacement can grow without limit. The evolution equations are integrated in time and give a relation for mean square vertical displacement. At long time, the RPE will dominate the TPE; mean square vertical displacement is then a measure of the total APE dissipated by the flow. The significance of this with respect to the total energy dissipated is given by the cumulative mixing efficiency, Ωc, which depends on the strength of stratification. In the case of decaying turbulence, mean square vertical displacement evolves to a constant value, proportional to Ωc. In the case of stationary turbulence, the (constant) rate of growth of mean square vertical displacement is proportional to Ωc. The analysis is demonstrated using direct numerical simulations of homogeneous shear flows with decaying, stationary, and growing turbulence. Results for the latter case show mean square vertical displacement to continually increase, and to have a reduced dependence on and reduced values of Ωc as the strength of stratification decreases. In general, simulation results are in agreement with the analysis and confirm that,in homogeneous stratified flows with mean shear, an effective time scale for verticaldispersion at long time is that of the turbulence decay time...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{considers a}} round, turbulent buoyant jet in an ambient crossflow that is either of uniform density {{or with a}} linear density stratification. The primary emphasis {{is the development of}} a fundamental understanding of the jet properties that are of interest in engineering design problems. These include jet trajectories, characteristic dilutions, {{and in the case of}} a stratified crossflow, the maximum and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>heights</b> of rise. Most previous studies of similar buoyant jet flows have used the integral method to solve for the jet characteristics. This approach requires an assumed relation for the rate of entrainment of ambient fluid by the jet, and also depends upon experimental evidence to estimate values for the coefficients in the assumed relation. Most previous experimental studies have been directed toward evaluating entrainment coefficients and have not considered a systematic investigation of the effects of the various jet and ambient flow parameters. A major objective of this investigation is to provide a basis for the interpretation and extension of the results from previous theoretical and experimental investigations. A systematic dimensional analysis is performed to define the basic problem and to provide approximate solutions without using the integral equations. The analysis indicates the types of experiments necessary to adequately describe general buoyant jet behavior and also provides a framework for the presentation of experimental data. The approximate solutions for the jet characteristics were derived from the dimensional analysis by considering asymptotic descriptions of a general buoyant jet as different effects become predominant in determining the flow behavior. The limiting cases considered are for the jet behavior controlled by either its initial momentum or by its buoyancy for situations where the ambient velocity either is relatively large or approaches zero. Combinations of these four asymptotic descriptions can be used to approximately describe a general buoyant jet. Several different types of flow behavior can be expected, depending upon the relative magnitudes of various characteristic length scales associated with these buoyant jet flows. These different types of flow can be compared to the theoretical solutions proposed by other researchers, providing a basis for better understanding previous research. Experiments were performed to confirm the asymptotic relations developed in the analysis, to evaluate the coefficients in the relations, and to determine the limits of their applicability. The experimental configuration was a salt water jet discharged downward into a tank of less dense fluid with either uniform density or linear density stratification. The Boussinesq approximation implies that these results will be comparable to a buoyant jet rising in a less dense ambient fluid. The crossflow was simulated by towing the jet source along the water surface in the tank. Jet trajectories and dilutions were measured for the experiments with an unstratified crossflow. For the experiments performed with the tank stratified, maximum and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>heights</b> of rise, a few trajectories, and jet dilutions were measured. The results of these various experimental measurements are presented in a unified manner to facilitate the application to design problems. The experimental evidence indicated that the coefficients in the asymptotic relations were somewhat dependent upon the initial jet volume flux, an observation that has not been previously noted by other researchers.

A cell carried in the flow stream will attain an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>height,</b> and a corresponding velocity, based on the balance of dielectrophoretic, gravitational, and hydrodynamic lift forces it experiences. We describe a theoretical model for this system and show that the cell velocity is a function of the mean fluid velocity, the voltage and frequency of the signals applied to the electrodes, and, most significantly, the cell dielectric properties. The validity of the model is demonstrated with human leukemia (HL- 60) cells subjected to a parallel electrode array, and application of the device to separating HL- 60 cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{moisture transfer}} {{to and from}} the walls of a building is the most important factor concerning the deteriorating effect of moisture in buildings envelopes. The presented simulator takes into account the (a) moisture transfer mechanisms {{to and from the}} building (capillary rise, drying, etc.), (b) wall configuration (materials and size), (c) construction materials properties, (d) seasonal region meteorological data (air temperature, humidity and velocity) and calculates the (a) seasonal wall moisture content along with the corresponding <b>equilibrium</b> moisture <b>height,</b> (b) capillary rising water flow rate, (c) wall drying flow rate, etc. The simulator has been developed in an Excel platform in a user-friendly environment and consists of four units: (a) process model, (b) problem solution algorithms, (c) database and (d) graphics interface. The proposed simulator is a powerful tool in decision-making concerning the building deteriorating evolution and the selection of appropriate protecting strategy, e. g., the plaster selection (material, size, replacing time), contributing to the sustainability of masonries.

40|$|The most extended, closed {{magnetic}} loops inferred on T Tauri stars confine hot, X-ray emitting plasma at {{distances from}} the stellar surface beyond the the X-ray bright corona and closed large-scale field, distances {{comparable to the}} corotation radius. Mechanical equilibrium models have shown that dense condensations, or "slingshot prominences", can rise to great heights due to their density and temperatures cooler than their environs. On T Tauri stars, however, we detect plasma at temperatures hotter than the ambient coronal temperature. By previous model results, these loops should not reach the inferred heights of tens of stellar radii where they likely {{no longer have the}} support of the external field against magnetic tension. In this work, we consider the effects of a stellar wind and show that indeed, hot loops that are negatively buoyant can attain a mechanical <b>equilibrium</b> at <b>heights</b> above the typical extent of the closed corona and the corotation radius.

40|$|We {{describe}} a remote sensing method {{for measuring the}} internal interface height field in a rotating, two-layer annulus laboratory experiment. The method is non-invasive, avoiding {{the possibility of an}} interaction between the flow and the measurement device. The height fields retrieved are accurate and highly resolved in both space and time. The technique is based on a flow visualization method developed by previous workers, and relies upon the optical rotation properties of the working liquids. The previous methods returned only qualitative interface maps, however. In the present study, a technique is developed for deriving quantitative maps by calibrating height against the colour fields registered by a camera which views the flow from above. We use a layer-wise torque balance analysis to determine the <b>equilibrium</b> interface <b>height</b> field analytically, in order to derive the calibration curves. With the current system, viewing an annulus of outer radius 125 mm and depth 250 mm from a distance of 2 m, the inferred height fields have horizontal, vertical and temporal resolutions of up to 0. 2 mm, 1 mm and 0. 04 s, respectively. ...|$|R
