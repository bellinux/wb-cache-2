40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the <b>installation</b> <b>tool.</b> In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket <b>installation</b> <b>tool.</b> A new gasket is placed on the <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements. On July 17 and 29, 2008 the Remote Gasket Replacement Tooling was successfully demonstrated in the REDC at the DWPF of The Savannah River Site...|$|E
40|$|Usability of {{installation}} and configuration of digital repository software {{is one of}} the major issues for the implementation of digital repositories. There has been an increase in the need to share collections amongst institutes; however a problem still lies in the complexity of installation of the software. This paper highlights the complexity of installation of DSpace and a description of an <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> that was developed and its underlying architecture. Experiments were carried out on the developed tool. The paper then gives a summary of the users, perceptions on the developed <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> compared to their past experience of installing and configuring DSpace. The results showed that users viewed that {{installation and}} configuration made much simpler by the tool. Consequently this suggests that installation and configuration of digital repository tools could be much simpler...|$|E
50|$|While wires may be crimped, {{they should}} not be heavily tinned with solder prior to {{installation}} in a screw terminal, since the soft metal will cold flow, resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. Screw connectors sometimes come loose if not done up tightly enough at fitting time. Verifying adequate tightening torque requires calibrated <b>installation</b> <b>tools</b> and proper training. In the UK, all screw connectors on fixed mains installations are required to be accessible for servicing, for this reason.|$|R

40|$|Sand {{compaction}} piles {{are used}} in practice for ground improvement of weak subsoil. These columnar inclusions improve the consolidation behaviour as well as reduce the compressibility of the soft ground. The current design procedure of these sand piles is based on simple empirical calculations, which do not take account fully of the sand pile behaviour. In order to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the behaviour of sand compaction piles, physical investigations are being conducted at ETH in Zurich. The basic system behaviour of soft soil and column is simulated physically by centrifuge modelling. Therefore a sand compaction pile <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> was developed and applied successfully in an initial test series. This allowed the stress paths encountered by the soil during the construction process of a displacement sand pile to be modelled realistically, because the stress situation in the soil changes significantly due to installation.

40|$|Abstract. The powder {{particles}} {{using the}} tool grinder {{is composed of}} two types. One is mounted on the rotating shaft of the machine tool. This tool is generally single cutting edge. The <b>installation</b> <b>tool</b> is a bolt shank fixed to the rotary shaft of the positioning groove. When you need to replace the tool mechanical enclosure open, loosen all bolts to remove the tool to replace the new tool. With no cutting edge tools can extend tool life. Reduce the number of replacement tools. The second tool is mounted on the housing of the machine tool. Single cutting edge of the tool mounting clearance is small, difficult to adjust the gap. Multi-blade cutter working gap can be formed when using the wedge mounting the inlet and outlet ports of the difference. Move the material in the resulting gap wedge and promote the formation of shear extrusion processing. Quick change fixed tool so that the tool sharp edge retention, reduce heat generation.
