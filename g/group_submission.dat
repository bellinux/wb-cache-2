40|$|Project-based {{learning}} (PBL) can simulate {{and reflect}} current industry practice. Many civil engineering design modules contain major elements of group work that provide open-ended realistic project scenarios that aim to integrate knowledge from different subject areas. The group work element of PBL reinforces collaboration and team-working {{seen by the}} construction industry as being very important and useful. In PBL different design options need to be explored and require students to research, critically analyse and communicate effectively. These activities help build professional and practical skills necessary for learning and provide students with the opportunity and freedom to organise their own programme of work. Assessment tasks are devised so that they satisfactorily demonstrate achievement of the intended learning outcomes. Assessment outcome {{is seen as a}} record of academic achievement that allows progression. Assessment methods are therefore essential tools used to measure learning. These methods influence and impact the nature of learning and the retention of knowledge. Devising the assessments for modules containing PBL requires careful consideration. Frequently in <b>group</b> <b>submissions,</b> academically weaker students rely on their peers to produce the work. Disagreements, none or late production of work by team members and personality clashes can also occur. PBL modules at UWL are assessed via a number of <b>group</b> and individual <b>submissions.</b> The <b>group</b> <b>submissions</b> are covered by two or three group assignments. Each member of the group is awarded the group mark unless evidence is provided to the contrary. The individual submission is set to determine an individual's overall contribution. This is covered by one assignment that requires reflection on group interaction and based on gained experience, how concept and final designs, procedures including time management and managing own learning, could have been improved. PBL assessments methods are used in conjunction with the more traditional assessments methods of exams and time-controlled assignments...|$|R
