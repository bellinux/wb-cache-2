40|$|New {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of biodiesel fuel droplet heating and evaporation, using previously developed models, are presented. Temperature gradient, recirculation and species diffusion within the droplets are taken into account. The results of calculations, taking into account the contribution of all components of biodiesel fuels (up to 16) and assuming that these fuels can be treated as a one component fuel, are discussed. It is pointed out that there are serious problems with the application of the approach, based on the analysis of diffusion of individual components, to the modelling <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> and <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> realistic Diesel fuel droplets, as the latter include more than 100 components. In our earlier papers, a new approach to the modelling <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> and <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> multi-component droplets, suitable for the case when a large number of components are present in the droplets, was suggested. This approach was based on the introduction of quasi-components, and the model was called the "quasi-discrete" model. It is pointed out that there are two main problems with the application of the quasi-discrete model to realistic Diesel fuels. Firstly, even if we restrict our analysis to alkanes alone, it appears not to be easy to approximate this distribution with a reasonably simple distribution function. Secondly, the contributions of other hydrocarbon families in addition to alkanes cannot be ignored in any realistic model of Diesel fuels.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} cosmic ray energy distributions as detected on earthbound, low flying balloon or high flying satellite detectors can be computed by employing the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> high energy particles from astrophysical sources. In this manner, the experimentally well known power law exponents of the cosmic ray energy distribution have been theoretically computed as 2. 701178 for the case of ideal Bose statistics, 3. 000000 for the case of ideal Boltzmann statistics and 3. 151374 for the case of ideal Fermi statistics. By "ideal" we mean virtually zero mass (i. e. ultra-relativistic) and noninteracting. These results are in excellent agreement with the experimental indices of 2. 7 with a shift to 3. 1 at the high energy ~ PeV "knee" in the energy distribution. Our purpose here is to discuss the nature of cosmic ray power law exponents obtained by employing conventional thermal quantum field theoretical models such as quantum chromodynamics to the cosmic ray sources in a thermodynamic scheme wherein gamma and zeta function regulation is employed. The key reason for the surprising accuracy of the ideal boson and ideal fermion cases resides in the asymptotic freedom or equivalently the Feynman "parton" structure of the ultra-high energy tails of spectral functions...|$|R

The latent <b>heat</b> component <b>of</b> subsurface <b>evaporation</b> is estimated from the residual <b>of</b> the sensible <b>heat</b> balance. This heat balance method requires measurement of vertical soil temperature and estimates of thermal properties for soil water evaporation determination. Our {{objective was to}} employ numerically simulated thermal and hydraulic processes using constant or diurnally cycled surface boundary conditions to evaluate and understand this technique. Three observation grid spacings, namely, 6 mm (tri-needle HPP), 3 mm (penta-needle HPP) and 1 mm, along with three soil textures (sand, silt, and silty clay) were {{used to test the}} heat balance method. The comparison <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> balance–based <b>evaporation</b> rate estimates with an independent soil profile water balance revealed substantial errors when thermal conductivity was averaged spatially across the evaporation front. Since the conduction component <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> flux is the dominant process at the evaporation front, the estimation <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate was significantly improved using depth-dependent instead of a space-averaged. A near-surface “undetectable zone” exists, where the heat balance calculation is irreconcilable, resulting in underestimation <b>of</b> total subsurface <b>evaporation.</b> The method performs better for medium- and coarse-textured soils than for fine-textured soils, where portions of the drying front may be maintained longer within the undetectable zone.
