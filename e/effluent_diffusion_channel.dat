40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> design for {{broccoli}} storage, an important cash crop and consumer commodity in Canada.

The respiration rate decreased with a reduction of O$ sb 2 $ concentration inside the chamber. A model to predict the respiration rate of broccoli {{as a function of}} O$ sb 2 $ concentration at different temperatures was developed. Experiments were then carried out to determine the cross sectional area and length of <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> leading to various final O$ sb 2 $ (steady-state) concentrations during the storage of broccoli. Combinations of cross sectional area of 0. 04, 0. 18, and 1. 15 cm$ sp 2 $ and length of 0. 6, 3, 7, 12, 18, and 25 cm were tested.

30|$|Regardless of the {{possible}} implications of these observations, the evolution of <b>diffusion</b> mechanisms and <b>channels</b> is not as gradual - or linear - as could be assumed. It is important to make two additional specifications {{to provide a more}} accurate account of trans-national diffusion patterns. First, it is quite possible, and even likely, that different trans-national <b>diffusion</b> <b>channels</b> operate simultaneously. Therefore, it is imperative to specify that both channels and mechanisms of diffusion complement, rather than supplement one another. Second, the existence or use of one particular channel does not preclude or exclude the existence or use of another. Moreover, the development of one can enrich and/or reinforce the other. Much like the FRPs themselves, one can argue <b>diffusion</b> <b>channels</b> (and mechanisms) to be interdependent.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{vertebrate}} nuclear pore complex (NPC) harbors an � 10 -nm diameter <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> that {{is large}} enough to admit 50 -kD polypeptides. We have analyzed the permeability properties of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear envelope (NE) using import (NLS) and export (NES) signal-containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. Compared with wild-type, passive export rates of a classical karyopherin/importin (Kap) Kap 60 p/Kap 95 p-targeted NLS-GFP reporter (cNLS-GFP) were significantly faster in nup 188 - � and nup 170 - � cells. Similar results were obtained using two other NLS-GFP reporters, containing either the Kap 104 p-targeted Nab 2 p NLS (rgNLS) or the Kap 121 p-targeted Pho 4 p NLS (pNLS). Elevated levels of Hsp 70 stimulated cNLS-GFP import, but had no effect on the import of rgNLS-GFP. Thus, the role of Hsp 70 in NLS-directed import may be NLS- or targeting pathway-specific. Equilibrium sieving limits for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> were assessed in vivo using NES-GFP reporters of 36 – 126 kD and were found to be greater than wild-type in nup 188 - � and nup 170 - � cells.

Single species of porins were isolated by solubilization of membranes and subsequent gel filtration in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate from the mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium that produced only single species of porin.

J. Microsc. 192 : 114 – 125), the passive permeability of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was measured for a homologous series of hydrophilic probe molecules. Nuclei were isolated from Xenopus oocytes and firmly attached to filters containing small cylindrical pores. Transport through membrane patches spanning filter pores was measured by scanning microphotolysis. Thus the permeability coefficients of single NPCs were determined for fluorescently labeled dextrans of ∼ 4, 10, and 20 kDa. Dextrans of ≥ 40 kDa could not permeate the NPC. The data were consistent with a model in which the NPC contains a single <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel.</b> By application of established theories for the restricted diffusion through small pores, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> was approximated as a cylinder with a radius of 4. 4 – 6. 1 nm (mean 5. 35 nm). Because the transport rate constant of the single NPC was known, the equivalent length of the channel could be also determined and {{was found to be}} 40 – 50 nm (mean 44. 5 nm). The symmetry of the NPC implies that a singular component such as the <b>diffusion</b> <b>channel</b> is located {{at the center of the}} NPC.

Except close to the critical point, we observe that by increasing the chemical potential one generally increases the damping rate of the quasinormal modes, which leads to a reduction of the characteristic equilibration times in the dual strongly coupled plasma. However, as one approaches the critical point the typical equilibration time (as estimated from the lowest non-hydrodynamic quasinormal mode frequency) increases, although remaining finite, while its derivative with respect to the chemical potential diverges with exponent - 1 / 2.
