40|$|Abstract—Orientation {{control of}} {{biological}} cells under <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{is important for}} cell birefringent imaging and micro-manipulation. Taking our microrobotic mouse embryo injection research as an example, this paper presents a cell orientation con-trol system operated under <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes.</b> A compact mo-torized rotational stage for inverted microscopy was developed for orienting the polar body of mouse embryos away from the injection site to avoid damage of cellular organelles. An in-house developed microdevice was used for immobilizing many cells into a regular pattern. The polar body is tracked by a visual tracking algorithm with a translation-rotation-scaling motion model, providing image position feedback to an image-based visual servo controller {{that is responsible for}} online calibration of coordinate transformation during visually servoed orientation of the first embryo. High-speed, automatic cell orientation is then conducted on other embryos in the same batch of immobilized embryos through coordinate trans-formation and 3 -DOF closed-loop position control. Experimental results demonstrate that the cell-orientation system is capable of orienting mouse embryos at a high speed of 720 ◦/s with an accuracy of 0. 24 ◦.

40|$|Time-lapse imaging is a {{powerful}} tool for studying cellular dynamics and cell behavior {{over long periods of time}} to acquire detailed functional information. However, commercially available time-lapse imaging systems are expensive and this has limited a broader implementation of this technique in low-resource environments. Further, the availability of time-lapse imaging systems often present workflow bottlenecks in well-funded institutions. To address these limitations we have designed a modular and affordable time-lapse imaging and incubation system (ATLIS). The ATLIS enables the transformation of simple <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> into live cell imaging systems using custom-designed 3 D-printed parts, a smartphone, and off-the-shelf electronic components. We demonstrate that the ATLIS provides stable environmental conditions to support normal cell behavior during live imaging experiments in both traditional and evaporation-sensitive microfluidic cell culture systems. Thus, the system presented here has the potential to increase the accessibility of time-lapse microscopy of living cells for the wider research community...|$|E
40|$|Live-cell {{correlative}} {{light and}} electron microscopy (CLEM) offers unique {{insights into the}} ultrastructure of dynamic cellular processes. A critical and technically challenging part of CLEM is the 3 -dimensional relocation of the intracellular region of interest during sample processing. We have developed a simple CLEM procedure that uses toner particles from a laser printer as orientation marks. This facilitates easy tracking of a region of interest even by eye throughout the whole procedure. Combined with subcellular fluorescence markers for the plasma membrane and nucleus, the toner particles allow for precise subcellular spatial alignment of the optical and electron microscopy data sets. The toner-based reference grid is printed and transferred onto a polymer film using a standard office printer and laminator. We have also designed a polymer film holder that is compatible with most <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes,</b> and have validated our strategy by following the ultrastructure of mitochondria that were selectively photo-irradiated during live-cell microscopy. In summary, our inexpensive and robust CLEM procedure simplifies optical imaging, without limiting the choice of optical microscope...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel microarray technology based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) in combination with DNA and protein bioassays immobilized at the TIRF surface. Unlike conventional microarrays that exhibit reduced signal-to-background ratio, require several stages of incubation, rinsing and stringency control, and measure only end-point results, our TIRF microarray technology provides several orders of magnitude better signal-to-background ratio, performs analysis rapidly in one step, and measures the entire course of association and dissociation kinetics between target DNA and protein molecules and the bioassays. In many practical cases detection of only DNA or protein markers alone does not provide the necessary accuracy for diagnosing a disease or detecting a pathogen. Here we describe TIRF microarrays that detect DNA and protein markers simultaneously, which reduces the probabilities of false responses. Supersensitive and multiplexed TIRF DNA and protein microarray technology may provide a platform for accurate diagnosis or enhanced research studies. Our TIRF microarray system can be mounted on upright or <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> or interfaced directly with CCD cameras equipped with a single objective, facilitating the development of portable devices.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{reports the}} {{detection}} of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria species in 14 swimming pools around Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Sampling was carried out at 4 sites (the platforms (P), wall (W), 1 meter from the wall (1) and middle (2)) of each swimming pool. These free living amoebae (FLA) were detected under light and <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> after being cultured {{on the surface of}} non-nutrient agar lawned with Escherichia coli. Acanthamoeba species were detected in higher number of culture plates from all sampling sites of all the swimming pools. While Naegleria, were detected in fewer culture plates at 3 sampling sites (absent at site P) of 8 swimming pools. This suggested that the thick double-walled cysts of Acanthamoeba were more resistant, thus remaining viable in the dry-hot areas of the platforms and in chlorinated water of the swimming pools whereas Naegleria cysts, that are fragile and susceptible to desiccation, preferred watery or moist areas for growth and proliferation. The prevalence of both FLA was highest at site W (76. 2 %), followed by site 1 (64. 7 %), lowest at site 2 (19. 4 %), and could be detected at all 3 sampling levels (top, middle and bottom) of these 3 sites.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an inverted}} microscope that can image specimens in both reflection and transmission modes simultaneously {{with a single}} light source. The microscope utilizes a digital micromirror device (DMD) for patterned illumination altogether with two single-pixel photosensors for efficient light detection. The system, a scan-less device with no moving parts, works by sequential projection {{of a set of}} binary intensity patterns onto the sample that are codified onto a modified commercial DMD. Data to be displayed are geometrically transformed before written into a memory cell to cancel optical artifacts coming from the diamond-like shaped structure of the micromirror array. The 24 -bit color depth of the display is fully exploited to increase the frame rate by a factor of 24, which makes the technique practicable for real samples. Our commercial DMD-based LED-illumination is cost effective and can be easily coupled as an add-on module for already existing <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The reflection and transmission information provided by our dual microscope complement each other and can be useful for imaging non-uniform samples and to prevent self-shadowing effects.

40|$|Cells {{are active}} {{components}} {{in their environment}} and constantly adjusting their performance to improve extracellular milieu changing. This approach is reflected their tends of maintaining intracellular homeostasis. When the cells encounter stress or pathologic stimuli, they can undergo a new manner (adaptation) and new steady state for achieving viability and function. If the external stress is exceeded or adaptive capability continues, cell injury develops (1, 2). Cells injury {{is engaged in a}} process that is reversible or irreversible. Injury is reversible when the stimuli are limited and removed. Only in the persistent stress or pathologic stimuli a reversible phase converted into irreversible phase (point-of-noreturn) and causes cell death(3). However, cell death is the most important step in embryogenesis, organ development, hemostasis and also the evolution of disease in any organ (1). The most classifications of mammalian cell death are apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis occurs naturally in many situations and helps to eliminate the cells that lost their efficiency. Cells undergoing apoptosis show biochemical events lead to cell changes (morphology) and death (4, 5). These features include cell blebbing, shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Unlike necrosis, which is a pathologic cell death, apoptotic cells release cell fragment called apoptotic bodies (1, 6). This image was taken with light microscopes (Nikon, TE 2000 <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes),</b> peripheral blood monocytes during 13 days culture initially change into macrophage-like cells and then due to lack of nutrition materials and a high level of toxic substance, to undergo cell death.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the monitoring catastrophic failure event in milling process using acoustic emission. Acoustic Emission (AE) is a naturally occurring phenomenon whereby external stimuli, such as mechanical loading, generate sources of elastic waves. AE occurs when a small surface displacement of a material is produced. This occurs due to stress waves generated {{when there is a}} rapid release of energy in a material, or on its surface. The wave generated by the AE source will be used to stimulate and capture AE in inspection, quality control, system feedback, process monitoring and others. In this thesis, the acoustic emission will be studied by carrying out experiments (milling) on the work piece and determine the material properties also dynamics of machines using acoustic emission detector. There are three cutting speeds and five conditions of depth of cut chosen for the experiments. The depths of cut and cutting speed are generated in the experiments and an acoustic emission sensor detects the acoustic emission signals and transfers it to the acoustic emission software. Then, the software generates the signals into RMS signal. Data taken from the software are plotted into a graph of RMS versus depth of cut. The experiment continued to determine the properties of materials using <b>Inverted</b> <b>Microscopes</b> (IM). Pictures of anomalies of the cutting tool, work piece and chipping have been taken from inverted microscope for observation and compared with acoustic emission graph (RMS).
