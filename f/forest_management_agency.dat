The results of communities' perspective are on the average level but communities did show their interests to be Involved in community forestry and the communities have indifferent attitudes toward the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies.</b> The main challenges of community forestry are the conflict between communities on forest land ownership and certain parties' objection due to conflicting views and Interest. The communities' forest dependency has significant effects toward the communities' access rights, forest resources and wildlife abundance, and forestry issues. Lastly, the extent of communities' employment In the forestry sector and Interaction with the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> are low. Conclusively, the study findings are able to achieve the research objectives and to reflect the Initial problem statements of this study. The proposed model of community forestry in Bau has to include five main elements which are the communities' perspective, attitudes, possible challenges, forest dependency and participation. It is recommended for future study to use different kind of analysis, methods and a larger sampling size to maximize the results of that study...|$|R

This paper describes a quantitative tool for setting {{priorities for the}} forestry assistance program administered by the Montana Division of Forestry. Logistic regression was used to better identify the type of forest owners to which assistance should be directed. (In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a probability that a certain event or activity will occur.) Data supporting model development were obtained from a questionnaire survey of forest landowners in the western portion of Montana. Four models were developed that pertain to past use of technical assistance, intention to harvest timber, and timber benefits as motivation for forest ownership. The most consistently useful independent variables were geographic region and past timber harvest activity. The author discusses procedures for interpreting results and for rating land ownerships for assistance. One model is discussed in detail, but the discussion is applicable to the other three models.

40|$|Increasing {{demand on}} forest {{planners}} and managers to conserve biodiversity and practise sustainable forestry whilst remaining economically viable {{has led many}} <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> to implement modeling approaches to assist multi-purpose forest planning. The integrated approach taken by the Forests Service in Victoria, Australia, to multipurpose forest planning analysis {{is based on a}} concept of creating a spatially standard, interactive, visual environment into which different types of models can be brought, used and easily replaced. The hub of such an approach is a flexible interface with a database that facilitates communication between applications. A geographic information system (ARC/INFO) and a linear programming model (SPECTRUM) link different types of models. This modeling process relies on iterative cycles where visualization plays a crucial part in the development of constraints and management prescriptions. Highly rectified remotely sensed images provide a source of spatial validation of input data, a spatial context for visualizing management intentions, and a context for spatial interpretation of the modeled results. Remotely sensed data is also used for monitoring change in the forest cover and updating the set of land units in the modeling cycle...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{development}} of landscape patterns over broad spatial and temporal scales is a major contribution to ecological sciences and is a critical area of research for <b>forested</b> land <b>management.</b> Boreal <b>forests</b> represent an excellent case study for such research because these forests have undergone significant changes over recent decades. We analyzed the temporal trends of four widely-used landscape pattern indices for boreal forests of Canada: forest cover, largest forest patch index, forest edge density, and core (interior) forest cover. The indices were computed over landscape extents ranging from 5, 000 ha (n = 18, 185) to 50, 000 ha (n = 1, 662) and across nine major ecozones of Canada. We used 26 years of Landsat satellite imagery to derive annualized trends of the landscape pattern indices. The largest declines in forest cover, largest forest patch index, and core forest cover were observed in the Boreal Shield, Boreal Plain, and Boreal Cordillera ecozones. Forest edge density increased at all landscape extents for all ecozones. Rapidly changing landscapes, defined as the 90 th percentile of forest cover change, {{were among the most}} forested initially and were characterized by four times greater decrease in largest forest patch index, three times greater increase in forest edge density, and four times greater decrease in core forest cover compared with all 50, 000 ha landscapes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 This thesis {{combines}} {{elements of}} forestry, interpersonal communication, and rhetoric to describe where residents of Coos Bay and North Bend Oregon obtain information about forests and forest uses, {{and how they}} view the credibility of that information. As a qualitative exploratory study, grounded theory methodology was used to develop theme statements and an emerging proposition from empirical data. The major {{findings of this study}} have been woven into two overarching theme statements. The first theme statement is: Personal and work relationships in their communities, as well as the availability and convenience of forest information, influence Coos Bay and North Bend respondents' perceptions of forest uses such as recreation, tree cutting, water quality, fish and wildlife, and wood products. The second theme statement is: Coos Bay and North Bend respondents' perceptions of forest uses such as recreation, tree cutting, water quality, fish and wildlife, and wood products are influenced by the internet and the media, despite respondents' self-reported mistrust of those sources. These findings indicate that availability and convenience of forest related information seems to outweigh the accuracy of that information for respondents. Therefore, this study suggests that the internet should be the dominant communication channel for <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies,</b> industries, and non-governmental organizations to improve their sharing of forest use information with Coos Bay and North Bend citizens, and the accessibility and effectiveness of their official websites and internet presence should be reevaluated in that light...|$|R
40|$|Public <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> {{throughout}} the East are facing numerous obstacles. Some public groups pressure to manage with techniques that maintain high amounts of canopy cover for threatened and endangered species, such as Cerulean warbler or Indiana bat. Other groups push for early successional habitat to favor game {{species such as}} ruffed grouse and white-tailed deer. Invasive species, such as tree-of-heaven and emerald ash borer, threaten community stability in many regions; control efforts draw heavily on agency resources. Lastly, there is an imminent danger to widespread shifts in many oak-dominated forests to less desirable, mesophytic tree species from prolonged oak regeneration failures. Within this backdrop, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry teamed with researchers from Purdue University, Indiana State University, Ball State University and Drake University to form the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment (HEE) in early 2006. This long-term (100 + years), landscape-scale, management study proposes to: a) Develop even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems that maintain oak-dominated forest communities and landscapes within the Central Hardwood Forest Region; b) Determine both {{the positive and negative}} impacts of these systems on communities of herbaceous, avian and terrestrial amphibian species groups; c) Determine the social and economic ramifications of these systems in both the local and regional communities; and d) Provide demonstration sites and develop novel educational materials and techniques to engage the public concerning <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> HEE is replicated across nine, 80 + ha sites near Bloomington, Indiana. Treatments include single-tree selection with scattered patch cuts, clearcuts, three-stage shelterwood harvests, and uncut controls. Preharvest measurements have been ongoing since 2006. Sites were treated from July 2008 to February 2009. The purpose of this talk is to describe the design of HEE, as well as document pre-harvest results from over a dozen ongoing studies being conducted on various ecological and social components of the project...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{expansion}} and over-cutting of trees for fuelwood are important causes of deforestation in arid and semi-arid {{countries such as}} Sudan. The consequence is increased desertification and high erosion and loss of soil nutrients leading to declining agricultural productivity. However, the social costs of the deforestation externality are not {{taken into account in}} present <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> and land use planning in Sudan leading to under-pricing and over-exploitation of the country's forest resources. This study evaluated the suitability of approaches commonly used by most <b>forest</b> resource <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> for prediction of the state and control of harvesting of forest resources against alternative empirical simulation models using relevant information about economic behaviour of trading agents in the fuelwood market. Results showed the clear superiority of models integrating market behaviour over current approaches in the ability to better simulate real trends of wood consumption and hence depletion rates. The study also adopted an optimal control model to derive socially optimal forest harvesting regimes. The results showed that current rates of forest resource rent recovery and reforestation efforts are very far from optimal. Results also suggest that, in addition to optimal pricing and higher reforestation efforts, promotion and availability of fuel substitutes and investment in wood energy conversion efficiencies have a strong potential for curbing the problem of deforestation in Sudan.

40|$|It is {{said that}} {{examining}} the cause of natural conflict is not easy because conflict is not only complex issue but also involves in various factors and actors. Determining reason of contestation over natural resources brings significance not only for researcher but also for natural resource managers. Therefore, {{purpose of this study}} is to determine main causes of forest conflicts in three districts of Lam Dong province, Vietnam. By involvement of unequal distribution of benefit sharing derived from the forests among forest stakeholders and illegal forest actions, this research analyzes these factors in relation to causes of forest conflicts. The qualitative method in geography is utilized in this study. The qualitative research data consisted of semi-structured interviews by interview guides and participant observation. For whole thirty interviewees, they come from three different levels; which are <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies,</b> including <b>forest</b> protection department, authorities (e. g. district and communal levels); forestry companies (e. g. state-own, joint venture, and private companies); and households. From interview to review, most of respondents indicated that the main actors related to contradictions are local households and forestry companies. The conflicts between the two expressed in both peaceful and open forms. “Illegal” activities could result from directly conflict between local households and forest companies because these illegalities disrupt the revenue of the forestry companies. Due to imbalance of access rights for local households to forest resources, the conflict happened when forestry companies take more right of access rather than the local households. Unequal distribution of benefit sharing derived from the forest resources is another main cause of forest conflict between local households and forest enterprises. Conversely, the conflicts between households/forest enterprises and forest mangers seldom happen because of relative relationships and inconvenience. This study is concluded that the contexts of forest conflicts in Lam Dong province are less common. Analyzing the impacts of forest conflict to livelihoods of forest-related people and seeking the resolution are recommended in further study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Australia has a {{high number}} of species that use tree hollows for nesting or {{roosting}} (Gibbons & Lindenmayer 2002), but there are no primary excavators such as woodpeckers present, {{as is the case in}} the northern hemisphere. This means that all hollows are produced by slow processes generally involving fire, fungi and termites, although some species are known to modify the size of cavities to an extent e. g. cockatoos, brushtail possums (Ambrose 1982; Saunders et at. 1982). Consequently, many years are required to form hollows, especially large hollows. There is a general decrease in hollow-bearing trees across Australia due to land clearing for urbanization and agriculture, forestry activities and the death ofhollow-bearing trees retained in paddocks and urban areas (Gibbons & Lindenmayer 2002). This has resulted in concern for the conservation of hollow-using fauna across Australia (Lindenmayer et at. 1993; Gibbons & Lindenmayer 1997; Whitford & Williams 2002; Wormington et at. 2002). ln Tasmania, hollow-dependent fauna are a management priority under the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (CofA & SoIT 1997). <b>Forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> in most states of Australia, including Tasmania, have developed management prescriptions for the conservation of habitat for hollow-using fauna (Wayne et at. 2006). Yet the tree hollow requirements and the degree to which fauna are dependent on hollows vary greatly among species. Consequently, an essential element of any retention strategy is knowledge of the fauna that use hollows in the region and their known or likely hollow requirements (Recher 1991). There are large differences in the amount of literature available for Tasmanian fauna species, birds in particular, with more information generally available for threatened species. This paper presents the results of a survey distributed to members of Birds Tasmania, intended to gather anecdotal information to assist in assessing the degree to which Tasmania's bird fauna are dependent on tree hollows. The information collected can also be used to help assess the conservation status and threatening process for these species...|$|R

This trend may foster a greater probability of encountering 2 or more disaster events simultaneously, increasing the potential to deplete emergency resources. Using Canadian <b>forest</b> fire <b>management</b> as a focal point, this research has determined {{the extent to which}} forest fire resource sharing (resources being equipment, fire fighter teams, planes, etc.) has been able to mitigate the impacts of simultaneous forest fire events induced by climate change. Provincial and territorial <b>forest</b> fire <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> are responsible for forest fire suppression within their jurisdictions, but when fires exceed their suppression capabilities they may request resources from other agencies using resource sharing agreements including: Compact agreements with American States, other international agreements and agreements initiated through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC). If the potential for simultaneous forest fires is neglected, excess fire activity may overwhelm the resource sharing structure. A historical analysis, 2 case studies, and a survey were employed to uncover information regarding simultaneous forest fires. Moreover, an examination of other resource sharing disciplines was used to uncover new ways of approaching resource sharing issues. The results of this study show that simultaneous fire events have overwhelmed the resource sharing system (during at least two years 1998 and 2003) and that modifications are needed to prepare for the potential increase in forest fire frequency...|$|R

As a result, efforts are being undertaken to restore natural processes, improve health, and foster resilience in forested systems. Such efforts involve diverse stakeholders, land <b>management</b> <b>agencies,</b> scientists, and the public, who work together collaboratively to find common goals and agreeable solutions. Central to collaborative <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> is an emphasis on using science to inform decision-making. Yet there are many challenges to applying science in decision-making and developing actionable scientific information for management. Many of the efforts to better align science and decision-making have focused on climate research, and additional empirical evidence is needed to provide context-specific recommendations for connecting science and decision-making in different areas of natural resource management. To that end, this dissertation provides {{an assessment of the}} role of science in collaborative <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> The central question that unifies this work is: how is science applied in decision-making for collaborative <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> and in what ways can the use of science for decision-making in this context be improved?

40|$|Abstract Forest {{and land}} fires in Southeast Asia have many social, economic, and environ-mental impacts. Tropical {{peatland}} fires affect global carbon dynamics, and haze from peat fires has serious negative {{impacts on the}} regional economy and human health. To mitigate these fire-related problems, <b>forest</b> and land <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> require an early warning system {{to assist them in}} implementing fire prevention and management plans before fire prob-lems begin. Fire Danger Rating Systems (FDRS) were developed for Indonesia and Malaysia to provide early warning of the potential for serious fire and haze events. In particular, they identify time periods when fires can readily start and spread to become uncontrolled fires and time periods when smoke from smouldering fires will cause an unacceptably high level of haze. The FDRS were developed by adapting components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, including the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System, to local vegetation, climate, and fire regime conditions. A smoke potential indicator was developed using the Drought Code (DC) of the FWI System.

Studies have shown that over 18. 5 million days, representing approximately 80 % of recreation user days, were spent by Canadians in recreational activities in forested lands. Furthermore, recreation has significant social and economic value that should be reflected in management decisions if sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> is to be achieved. The importance of recreation in forests {{has resulted in the}} selection of measures of recreation participation as one of the relevant indicators of sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> reporting in Canada. This suggests that recreation areas should be {{an important component of the}} values of forest at risk due to loss from wildfire. However, the presence of recreationists, who are considered to be the highest values at risk, dispersed on the fire prone landscape presents some issues for fire <b>management</b> <b>agencies.</b> These issues include the possibility of recreationists perishing in a wildfire and/or the possibility of fire starts as a result of recreation activities which are projected to increase into the future. For fire <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> that strive to suppress all wildfires, the latter issue is particularly challenging when faced with resource constraints. Thus, a move away from suppression of all wildfires to suppression based on protecting highest values at risk is needed. An explicit incorporation of recreation values is advantageous in that these values are closely linked to the presence of recreationists. Therefore, during fire events, directing resources to high value recreation areas fulfill a fire management goal of protecting highest values at risk as well as identifying areas of the landscape where the suppression efforts are to be directed.

Our interviews highlight a critical disconnect between NIPF owner motivations and VIP incentives, as well as misallocated resources for VIP promotion by state agencies, driving low enrollment. At the core, low enrollment in VIPs is generated by inadequate communication between NIPF owners and program managers, along with distrust of government agency objectives. Viewing managers as “street level bureaucrats”, civil servants whose job discretion is impacted heavily by available resources, may increase our understanding of the issues plaguing VIPs and help identify improvements to VIP design and implementation...|$|R

Spruce (41, 09 %) is the most represented evergreen tree (conifer). <b>Forest</b> <b>management</b> file 45 is that the most represented. 10 years' time period was selected for survey of the state of regeneration (<b>forest</b> <b>management</b> plan 2002 [...] 2011). On the basis of the available <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> plan and <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> records the ratio of natural and artificial regeneration in every year was stated - for individual <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> files and whole <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Part of the work was also a field survey to assess the forest establishment. On <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> Deblín there were regenerated approximately 222 hectare (7 %) during the years 2002 [...] 2011, from that amount 74 % was artificial regeneration and 26 % was a share of natural regeneration. Restoring forest area on <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> file 451 is 23 % from which 91 % is artificial regeneration. Natural reproduction wasn't shown on <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> file 017 and <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> file 253. Natural reproduction (59 %) predominates on <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> file 456. On the average 6500 pieces/hectare were planted. Spruce represented only about 29 % and scotch pine about 9 % in artificial regeneration during the years 2002 [...] 2011. On the other hand, the planting of oak (about 25 %) and larch (about 14 %) raised. Average costs for regeneration of 1 hectare of forest were 56 306 CZK in the year 2005, 40 347 CZK in the year 2006 and 45 909 CZK per hectare in the year 2007.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s several new {{approaches}} towards <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> which include active participation of local communities, {{have been tried}} out in many tropical regions. As {{a result of these}} efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> can often be based on such indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> systems. This paper alms to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> are discussed. <b>Forest</b> <b>management</b> is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> practices are identified, e. g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum...|$|R
40|$|In {{attempts}} to foster sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> practices, participation of local communities has become {{widely recognized as}} a better alternative than the traditional protectionist approach. This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64. 82 % of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits {{were found to be}} the main factors influencing participation in the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> program and, hence, require immediate attention.
