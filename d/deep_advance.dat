40|$|Future {{coal mining}} systems {{will be able}} to cut from {{crosscut}} to crosscut where advances could exceed 100 ft. However, limitations arise when ventilating such mining systems. In <b>deep</b> <b>advance</b> mining, there would be no workers at the face to advance ventilation tubing or curtain manually. Traditional methods also provide no means for maintaining face ventilation after the miner backs away from the face. U. S. Bureau of Mines research is studying means to provide effective ventilation at cut depths beyond the current limit of 4 D ft. Several innovative ventilation schemes are currently being considered. One such method is the use of a jet fan to ventilate a deep cut. A jet fan is simply a freestanding fan using little or no ducting to direct the ventilation flow. Jet fan testing in a 90 -ft entry revealed that higher exit velocities and greater penetration depth occurred when various configurations were used to confine and direct the air flow. Additional testing also indicated that 2, 200 cfm of fresh air was delivered to the face 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 90 ft distant when a check curtain was used to limit entrainment around the fan. Without this curtain, this quantity dropped to only 1, 000 cfm. This testing indicated that a jet fan was capable of providing ventilation to a distant face area. It also highlighted potential problems, such as recirculation at the fan and reentrainment in the jet flow. Despite these potential problems, jet fans may be adequate for ventilating cuts exceeding 4 D ft...|$|E
40|$|A dinâmica da água em sistema de plantio direto (PD) é alterada em relação ao preparo convencional (PC) devido a modificações na estrutura do solo e a presença de palha na superfície. Para avaliar estas diferenças foram conduzidos experimentos de campo, em 2001 / 02 e 2002 / 03, em Eldorado do Sul, RS. O objetivo geral foi quantificar alterações físico-hídricas no perfil e na superfície do solo em PD e PC, com ênfase na dinâmica da água e respostas das plantas de milho. Os sistemas de manejo do solo foram implantados na área em 1995. Foram avaliadas propriedades físicas, a movimentação e a armazenagem de água no solo. Mediu-se a infiltração e a capacidade de campo e monitorou-se a dinâmica da água durante o ciclo da cultura, enfocando a secagem do solo e a extração de água em períodos sem precipitação. Nestes períodos também foi determinada a evaporação da água na superfície e avaliadas respostas das plantas. Os efeitos do plantio direto se evidenciaram nas camadas de solo próximas à superfície. A mesoporosidade foi a propriedade física mais afetada, apresentando uma distribuição exponencial de mesoporos no plantio direto, enquanto no preparo convencional a mesma se aproximou de uma curva normal. Em geral, a condutividade hidráulica, a retenção e a disponibilidade de água foram mais elevadas em plantio direto, principalmente, próximo à superfície. O solo em PD também apresentou maior umidade volumétrica com menor energia de retenção, resultando em redução no avanço da frente de secagem do solo e extração de água. A evaporação também foi maior em PD, demonstrando que a maior umidade no solo em plantio direto se deve ao aumento na capacidade de armazenagem de água. O aprofundamento radicular foi sempre maior no preparo convencional. O plantio direto altera propriedades físicas ligadas à dinâmica da água, proporcionando maior disponibilidade hídrica no solo ao longo do tempo. The {{dynamics}} {{of water in}} no-tillage soils (NT) is modified {{in comparison to the}} conventional tillage (CT) because of alterations in the soil structure and the presence of straw on the surface. Field experiments were conducted in 2001 / 02 and 2002 / 03, in Eldorado do Sul, Brazil, in order to evaluate those modifications. The main objective was to quantify physical and hydrological alterations in the soil profile and surface related to the tillage systems, taking emphasis in the water dynamics and maize plants responses. Those tillage systems were implanted in the experimental area in 1995. Soil physical properties, water moving and storage into the soil profile were evaluated. The water infiltration and the field capacity were measured in the experimental area. The water dynamics was monitored along the crop cycle, focusing the soil drying and water uptake by plants during several periods without rain. In these periods, the evaporation at the soil surface was measured, while plant responses were evaluated. Highest effects of no-tillage were detected in the soil layers close to the surface. The mesoporosity was the most affected property, showing a exponential distribution of mesopores in the notillage soil, while it tended to a normal distribution in the conventional system. In general, the no-tillage soil had highest values of hydraulic conductivity, water retention and water storage, mainly close to the surface. The no-tillage soil presented also a higher water content in low energy levels, as compared to the conventional system, reducing the <b>deep</b> <b>advance</b> of soil drying and water extraction by plants. The evaporation at the no-tillage soil surface was higher than in CT, showing that its highest water content must be related to increases in the water storage capacity. The root deep growing was higher in the conventional system than in NT. The no-tillage systems leads to alterations of several soil physical properties related to the water dynamics, increasing the water availability to plants, in the course of time. 2 Doctoral thesis in Agronomy, Faculdade de Agronomia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.
