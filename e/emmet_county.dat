5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and <b>Emmet</b> <b>County.</b> In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to <b>Emmet</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wayne County, the {{location}} of the automotive capital Detroit, has the most NHLs, with 13, followed by <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> and Mackinac County with three each. Five counties have two each, and seven counties each have one listing. Michigan's first NHLs were designated on October 9, 1960, when three locations were chosen. The latest designation was made on October 31, 2016. Ten Historic Landmarks in Michigan are more specifically designated National Historic Landmark Districts, meaning that they cover a large area rather than a single building.|$|E
5|$|As US31 curves {{around to}} the {{northeast}} and east in Charlevoix County, it follows {{a section of the}} Lake Michigan shoreline that is not considered to be part of any bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of Charlevoix. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of M-66 and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of Bay Shore, US31 crosses into <b>Emmet</b> <b>County.</b> The trunkline continues past the Bay Harbor development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of Petoskey.|$|E

5|$|Until 1933, M-131 had {{terminated}} in Harbor Springs; {{the highway}} {{was extended to}} the north along Little Traverse Bay and the Lake Michigan shoreline through the community of Good Hart before terminating in Cross Village. This section of highway would be stripped of its designation in 1937 and truncated back to Harbor Springs. In late 1938 or early 1939, the State Highway Department extended US 131 along the M-131 corridor to Petoskey. This allowed US131 to finally connect to its parent, US31 {{for the first time}} since their inception in 1926. The MSHD re-extended M-131 back to Cross Village in 1945. The highway remained as such until 1967 when a slight realignment was made in <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> along the lakeshore as M-131 is routed on to its final alignment.|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{continues}} northward through Cheboygan County, {{passing the}} community of Indian River and spanning the river of the same name. North of town, the freeway traverses the area between Burt and Mullett lakes before intersecting {{the southern end of}} M-27; that highway provides access to Topinabee and Cheboygan. I-75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County. Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for C-64 and C-66, a pair of county-designated highways in this area. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of US31 and picks up the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) designation before entering <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> {{on the south side of}} Mackinaw City. I-75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US23. After that interchange, the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT) merges in from the south. There is one more interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the Mackinac Bridge.|$|E
5|$|US23 {{follows the}} Lake Huron {{shoreline}} through Cheboygan County through woodlands past Cheboygan State Park and Duncan Bay. On {{the eastern edge}} of Cheboygan the highway intersects F-05 before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the Cheboygan River on the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge near the mouth of the river and the dock for the USCGC Mackinaw. On {{the west side of the}} river, US23 meets the northern terminus of M-27 at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as C-66 as US23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on Mackinaw Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward Mackinaw City. As it approaches the village, it passes Historic Mill Creek State Park and several motels.

25|$|The Robison family murders, also {{referred}} to as the Good Hart murders, were the mass murders of Richard Robison, his wife Shirley Robison (née Fulton), and their four children; Ritchie, Gary, Randy, and Susan on June 25, 1968. The upper-middle-class family from the metropolitan Detroit area of Lathrup Village, Michigan, were shot and killed while vacationing in their Lake Michigan cottage just north of Good Hart, Michigan, near the Straits of Mackinac. This case remained unsolved after a 15-month investigation by the Michigan State Police and the <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> Sheriff's Office.

500|$|Roadways {{along the}} route of Levering Road in Cheboygan County existed {{as far back as}} 1902 in Hebron and Munro {{township}}s; the section south of the township line was not yet built at the time. [...] By 1927, Levering Road extended across the tip of the Lower Peninsula; near the Hebron–Beaugrand township line in Cheboygan County, the county road made a jog to follow what is now Wollangur and Hill roads. In 1930, the ECRC paved Levering Road between US31 and the county line and the CCRC paved the roadway in Beaugrand Township. By mid 1936, it was paved from a point between Cross Village and the Pleasantview Road intersection to the county line in <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> as well as the Beaugrand Township section in Cheboygan County. During World War II, the counties reverted most of Levering Road to a gravel surface; pavement in <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> started east of Pleasantview Road instead of west, and Cheboygan County had no sections paved. At the same time, the new roadway was opened to bypass Wollangur and Hill roads.|$|E

[...] On July 4, 1850, a drunken mob of fishermen vowed to kill the [...] "Mormons" [...] or drive them out, only to be awed into submission when Strang fired a cannon (which he had secretly acquired) at them. [...] Competition for business and jobs added to tensions on the island, as did the increasing Strangite monopoly on local government, made sure after Beaver and adjacent islands were attached first to <b>Emmet</b> <b>County</b> in 1853, then later organized into their own insular county of Manitou in 1855.|$|E

40|$|Rivers, Lakes, & WetlandsThe {{east and}} west branch of the Maple River in Cheyboygan and <b>Emmet</b> <b>Counties</b> differ in temperature. We {{hypothesized}} the warmer; East Branch would have a higher fish diversity and richness. We expected to find the same invertebrates in both temperatures with equal diversity, richness and abundance. On July 24 th and 26, we sampled both rivers. We sampled fish with an electrofisher for 100 meters. Serber samplers and kick-nets were used to sample invertebrates. The substrate percentages were recorded {{as well as the}} temperatures. Phosphorus, nitrogen, alkalinity and pH samples were also taken. The East Branch and West Branch had very similar invertebrate diversities but the West Branch had greater fish diversity. The East Branch had a higher richness but a very low evenness. Salmonidae were only found in the colder West Branch due to low thermal tolerance. Only two species were found in both branches indicating the importance of temperature in determining community composition. Warmer temperatures led to higher fish species richness but didn’t affect diversity. Habitat, phosphorus and discharge influenced species composition while the temperature had very little influence on invertebrate diversity, abundance and richness...|$|R
500|$|M-68 {{starts in}} the {{community}} of Alanson [...] east of Little Traverse Bay in <b>Emmet</b> <b>County.</b> US31 runs along Burr Avenue parallel to the former Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad line and depot in town. M-68 starts at an intersection between Chicago Street and Burr Avenue. The trunkline runs southeasterly from this intersection and on a bridge over the Crooked River. After leaving town, the highway curves to run due east through hilly terrain. After crossing the Cheboygan County line, the roadway meets the community of Burt Lake. It curves southeasterly along the shoreline of the lake of the same name. The roadway rounds the south end of Burt Lake and approaches the community of Indian River. South of Burt Lake State Park, the trunkline meets Straits Highway, the former routing of US27 through Indian River. M-68 turns north along Straits Highway through downtown and then turns east toward Interstate 75 (I-75). It is along this section of M-68 that the roadway crosses the Sturgeon River. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measured the highest annual average daily traffic (AADT) figures for M-68 along the section of highway west of Indian River.
