50|$|During the Gothic-revivals of the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, various writers used the {{supposedly}} spontaneous outbreaks of popular piety {{exemplified by the}} 'Cults of Carts' to evoke an over-romanticised view of medieval Europe as a religious golden-age. More modern scholarship has tended to view the stories more sceptically. As with all such foundation myths, evidence from <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> must be tempered by {{an understanding of the}} role of such stories in promoting individual churches (and the Benedictine order in general) and also by the tendency of medieval chroniclers to adapt and copy stories from earlier texts (see topos).|$|E

40|$|The gendered {{division}} of labor in household economies {{is well known in}} <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> of many societies, although archaeological evidence for it is often elusive. Our study compares ethnohistorical accounts of household organization with archaeological patterns at a 17 th-century village on the island of Guam in the Marianas archipelago to determine if these different sources of evidence provide similar insights. We investigated archaeological assemblages from two latte (megalithic) buildings to document their economic activities. Unexpected differences in their assemblages revealed that economic activities varied between the two latte buildings. They were domiciles of a single economically integrated household, but their disparate functions likely signaled a gendered {{division of}} labor.

This determination is based on the close match between site details with various ethnohistoric accounts of Cathlapotle. The site was occupied by ca.

40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that the W. S. P. U. 's strategy choices were unimportant in regard to winning women's suffrage. It confirms the hypothesis that the long-range strategy of the W. S. P.

In addition to filling an apparent research gap by systematically analyzing these choices, this thesis synthesizes and tests several piecemeal theories of social movements within the general framework of the natural history approach. The analysis utilizes data drawn from movement leaders' autobiographies, <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> of the militant movement, and the standard histories of the entire British women's suffrage movement.

40|$|Two glass trade beads, one red and one yellow, {{retrieved}} from a secure archaeological context on Magoro Hill, an erstwhile Venda stronghold in South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s Limpopo Province, were analyzed with Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy identified the pigment coloring the yellow bead as lead tin yellow Type II {{and the glass}} as a typical soda-lime-silica glass. Both pigments and glass type were in use over a long time span and therefore the bead cannot {{be used as a}} temporal marker. The pigment coloring the red bead, on the other hand, was identified as nano-(Zn,Cd) S 1 -xSe x mixed crystals, a pigment that was only widely used in the early 20 th century.

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} has investigated {{the rate of}} deterioration of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia since European settlement and the severity of human impacts on that ecosystem. Yet in previous environmental histories of the Great Barrier Reef, the impacts of coral collecting have not been adequately documented. Using documentary and oral history sources, a reconstruction of historical coral collecting is possible; analysis of those sources indicates that the extent, duration and intensity of coral collecting led to profound transformations of some coral reefs, with particular degradation at Double, Green, Heron, Masthead and Lady Musgrave Islands, and at Wistari Reef. That degradation {{was due to the}} combined impacts of prolonged, cumulative coral souveniring by tourists and to the removal of large amounts of material by commercial collectors. Although coral collecting has been restricted since 1933, both licensed and unlicensed collecting continued after that year. Extensive documentary evidence indicates that coral collecting was accompanied by the deterioration of coral reefs; those <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> are supported by oral history evidence. Evaluation of the precise impacts of coral collectors in the Great Barrier Reef requires further scientific research and monitoring, although comparison with other coral reef ecosystems suggests that those impacts are likely to have been severe...|$|E
40|$|Jones, C. A., Davies, S. J., & Macdonald, N. (2012). Examining {{the social}} {{consequences}} of extreme weather: {{the impact of}} the 1947 winter in upland Wales, UK. Climatic Change, 113 (1), 35 - 53 Extreme forms of weather are predicted to become more frequent experiences in the future. However, the hardest event to mitigate against is the unexpected. In the UK, the occurrence of winter snowfall is difficult to predict, highly variable, both spatially and temporally and predicted to become less common in the future. This paper examines the consequences of the severe winter of 1946 / 1947 at the local scale through a Welsh case study of Cwm Tywi, a community of upland sheep farms. This community had shown great resilience during the snowiest winter on record in comparison with other, more urban communities, but the inhabitants eventually abandoned their homes because of the emotional distress caused by the loss of {{a large proportion of the}} livestock. In addition to the severity of the snow, perceptions of the extreme nature of this event and the community?s ability to mitigate as a result of rurality, self-sufficiency and remoteness are investigated through the analysis of interviews, oral histories, and other <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts.</b> This case study provides an insight into the complexity of understanding vulnerability, adaptation and resilience, which are temporally and spatially specific. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an historical archaeology programme designed {{to investigate and}} interpret apparent anomalies between the <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> of the 1824 – 1829 British settlement on Melville Island and the information conveyed by its physical position and material construction, as demonstrated in the remaining ruins of the settlement. Information gained through a part-time project of four years of historical study, and three seasons of archaeological investigation of the settlement is compiled and presented. The archaeological work concentrated particularly on the stronghold, Fort Dundas, to evaluate the military component of the settlement. Both archival and archaeological evidence is considered, and the influences {{of the world and}} regional geopolitical context bearing on the British venture are evaluated. The thesis argues that, while the documentary evidence outlining the planning for the Melville Island outpost speaks in great part of the establishment of a commercial trading port, the implementation of the project by the Admiralty took the form of constructing an imperialist military station. Examination of the ruins of Fort Dundas and consideration of its geographical location reveal little orientation toward commercial activity, but considerable preparation for defence. This interpretation of the Melville Island venture throws doubt on its common description as a ‘failed settlement of the north’. Fort Dundas may more accurately be seen as the instrument of a military gambit, which served its purpose in British imperialist strategy and was retired once its function had been served...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{resolution}} achievable by a time-of-flight neutron strain scanner has been harnessed {{using a new}} data analysis methodology (NyRTex) to determine, nondestructively, the spatial variation of crystallographic texture in objects of cultural heritage. Previous studies on the crystallographic texture at the centre of three Napoleonic War era copper bolts, which demonstrated {{the value of this}} technique in differentiating between the different production processes of the different types of bolts, were extended to four copper bolts from the wrecks of HMS Impregnable (completed 1786), HMS Amethyst (1799), HMS Pomone (1805) and HMS Maeander (1840) along with a cylindrical `segment' of a further incomplete bolt from HMS Pomone. These included bolts with works stamps, allowing comparison with <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> of the manufacturing processes used, and the results demonstrated unequivocally that bolts with a `Westwood and Collins' patent stamp were made using the Collins rather than the Westwood process. In some bolts there was a pronounced variation in texture across the cross section. In some cases this is consistent with what is known of the types of hot and cold working used, but the results from the latest study might also suggest that, even in the mature phase of this technology, some hand finishing was sometimes necessary. This examination of bolts from a wider range of dates is an important step in increasing our understanding of the introduction and evolution of copper fastenings in Royal Navy warships...|$|E
40|$|From {{the late}} thirteenth century, traitors in England were {{subjected}} to spectacular rituals of public execution that could include drawing, hanging, disembowelling, beheading, quartering and bodily display. These executions took place within {{a context in which}} the human body was saturated with significance. The body of Christ, the body politic imagined through the body of the king, and the whole and perfect body of the perfect knight were all central constructs in medieval thought. This thesis considers the polyvalent cultural meanings and responses that could be generated when the traitor’s broken and divided body was read in relationship to these other, idealised bodies. The ritualised processes of the traitor’s execution were intended to send a message about hegemonic power, particularly the king’s power over the bodies and lives of his subjects. However, the public and performative nature of these spectacles meant that they could provoke unpredictable and unexpected interpretations. Through a close analysis of <b>documentary</b> <b>accounts</b> of a number of high-profile executions that took place in late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century England, this study explores the ways the traitor’s body could work to destabilise and subvert dominant notions and relationships of status, gender, and political authority that the ritual of execution was intended to reinforce. The work that follows is structured around three thematic chapters. In Chapter Two, it examines the ways the trial and punishment of traitors made manifest deep uncertainties surrounding the social status of ‘knighthood’, in the process publicly exposing cultural and political conflicts over claims to power. Chapter Three turns to the challenges the traitor posed to the construction of aristocratic masculinity. Beginning from a premise that the categories of ‘knight’ and ‘traitor’ were ostensibly wholly oppositional but in reality mutually constitutive, it examines the potential for slippage from the masculine ideal of knighthood to the monstrous feminised inversion represented by the traitor. Chapter Four considers the complicated relationship that could develop between the traitor’s body to the bodies of Christ and the martyrs. It analyses a number of accounts that actively engage with the Passion topos in ways that invite alternative interpretations and resistant responses to acts of spectacular public execution...|$|E
