The spherical shape and polydisperse composition of Al powders consisting of nano- and submicrometre particles (from 0. 05 to 5 μm) allow dense packing of the PAS (1240 kg/m 3) and provide the possibility to produce 1. 5252 m 3 (at 1 atm) of hydrogen from 10 - 3 m 3 of PAS. The presence of a nanosized fraction ensures a short induction period of the reaction with water and a high rate of hydrogen release.

40|$|La demanda de componentes mecánicos de alta calidad y gran exactitud para sistemas de elevada precisión esta aumentando considerablemente en los últimos años a nivel mundial. Este hecho ha provocado el desarrollo de nuevas tecnologías aplicadas a los procesos de corte. El desarrollo {{integral}} de las máquinas herramientas (controles, husillos de alta velocidad) de las herramientas de corte (nuevos materiales para los substratos y capas) y de la tecnología de maquinado posibilitó la aplicación del corte a altas velocidades (High speed Cutting HSC). El aumento de las velocidades de corte es una de las formas de incrementar la eficiencia de los procesos productivos a través de la reducción de los tiempos de fabricación. La disminución en varias veces de los tiempos de fabricación, se logra no solo por los tiempos de maquinado sino también por la sustitución o reducción de otros procesos de elaboración que forman parte de la cadena productiva, que en ocasiones son relativamente lentos como son la <b>electroerosión,</b> el acabado manual en la producción de moldes y troqueles así como los cambios de operaciones de la pieza bruta. Por ser un proceso relativamente nuevo, apenas desde los años 90 es que se implementa la introducción del HSC y muchas cuestiones tecnológicas aun están sin respuesta. Por otro lado las características ya conocidas de esta nueva tecnología indican una buena perspectiva de aplicación en los más diversos segmentos de la industria.

The {{demand of}} mechanical components {{of high quality}} and great accuracy for systems of high precision, increasing considerably {{in the last years}} at world level. This fact has caused the development of new applied technologies to the cutting processes. The integral development of machine tools (you control, high-speed spindle) of the cutting tools (new materials for the substrata and layers) and of the technology of having schemed facilitated the application of the cut with high speeds cutting (High Speed Cutting HSC). The increase of the cutting speeds is one of the ways for increasing the efficiency of the productive processes, through the reduction of the manufacturing times. The reduction in several times of the manufacturing times, is not achieved alone for the times of machining but also for the substitution or to minimize other elaboration processes {{that are part of the}} productive chain that are relatively slow in occasions as they are the <b>electroerosión,</b> the manual finish in the production of moulds and dies as well as the changes of operations of the piece. To hardly be a relatively new process from the years 90 it is that the introduction of the HSC is implemented and many technological questions are even without answer. On the other hand the characteristics already well known of this new technology they indicate a good application perspective in the most diverse segments in the industry.

30|$|Thus, it is {{possible}} to manufacture many dies of complex shapes from a single mold. Then, the external surface of the die is made conductive by spraying a thin layer of graphite. The die thus coated is immersed into a nickel sulfamate bath and subjected to a current. The immersion time and current intensity are the parameters which condition the thickness of the deposit. To ensure uniform thickness, the die is rotated in the bath. In addition, masks whose geometry is adjusted by trial-and-error are applied to complete the process. In order to extract the shell to be tested from the die without contact or mechanical actions which could create mechanical imperfections, the aluminum die is dissolved in caustic soda and the resin die is carved out from the inside and separated from the specimen. Finally, the ends are cut to shape by <b>electroerosion</b> to guarantee the quality of the supports and the perpendicularity with the axis of the shell. The thickness of the shell is quasi-constant, except that it is reduced by one-tenth along the vertical creases. It was assumed to be constant and equal to the average value for the purpose of the simulations. By design, these shells are very stiff with respect to circumferential modes 8 – 13 : consequently, the roundness imperfections were negligible (less than one-hundredth of the thickness). This procedure led to the manufacturing of “laboratory quality” shells.|$|E
40|$|Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) is an {{attractive}} subtractive method for complex 3 d structurization of hard and very hard conductive and semi-conductive materials. The machining capabilities of a material do not depend on its hardness but on its electric conductibility and its melting point. The absence of any mechanical interaction between tool (the electrode) and machined part makes the <b>electroerosion</b> a well-adapted process for micro-structurization. In the passage from the macro to the micro-electroerosion (µEDM), some {{of the elements of}} the machine have to be adapted in order to improve the performances and to obtain accurate movements. The goal is to manufacture millimeters-sized shapes with an accuracy of a hundred of nanometers. This thesis deals the problem of the µEDM with a three degrees of freedom (DOF) mechanism, based on a parallel kinematics and flexure joints (the Delta 3 robot). In addition to its high accuracy (5 nm) and high bandwidth (500 Hz), the Delta 3 robot has the particularity of being free of backlash, wear and stick-slip phenomena. These performances have allowed to verify the importance of the time constants in the servo loop of the process, by many experiences of micro-drilling. Simulations have demonstrated the advantages brought by the dynamic, in the improvement of the µEDM process. Bad flushing conditions and very small gaps (< 10 µm), generate elevated gradients of contamination, to which the frequency response of the machine must be adapted. Simulations have shown that the balance between the material removal rate and the evacuation rate can be improved by adjusting the electrode-part distance at a frequency of a few hundreds of hertz. These back and forth movements have to be fast and accurate: first, to adjust quickly and precisely the breaking voltage distance and second, to guarantee a good machining accuracy. An industrial version of the prototype finalized during this thesis will be commercialized soon by AGIE (the company that supported this work) ...|$|E
