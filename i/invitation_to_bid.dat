40|$|The “two-contract” {{analysis}} of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Ron Engineering has created a very substantial obstacle to relief for mistaken bidders who discover calculation errors upon {{the opening of the}} bids. Nonetheless, Canadian courts are inclined to narrowly distinguish that analysis and grant relief in cases of extreme error in order to avoid unduly onerous penalties for mistaken bidders and large unearned windfalls for issuers of <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>bid.</b> This article argues that recent decisions of Canadian appellate courts articulating a rule which would excuse bidders where the burden imposed by the miscalculation is so grossly disproportionate that enforcement of the mistaken bid would be unconscionable represent a more satisfactory and elegant {{solution to the problem of}} mistaken bids and represents a useful incremental change in the law of contractual mistake...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} aspects {{related to}} competitiveness in the <b>Invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bid</b> (ITBs) {{of the public}} tender for the concession of the urban bus public transport services in the Metropolitan Region of Recife (RMR), in the Brazilian Northeastern Region. The bids were conducted by three different public bodies - the Municipalities of Recife and Olinda and the State of Pernambuco. Basic features of the bidding terms are presented {{and some of their}} aspects that have jeopardized competition are pointed out, notably the small number of lots, the lack of diversification of the size of lots, the possibility of forming consortia with unlimited number of participants, and the ownership of depots. Hence, some criticisms towards the bidding terms are stated and in order to prove the criticisms it is shown a simulation of an arrangement amongst incumbents, based on the rules of the tenders themselves, in which the allocation of potential winners ex post bidding does not differ from the ex ante scenario. Since the biddings have already been concluded and their results confirm the arrangement simulated, and since their winners have not proposed any amount bellow the reserve prices, the main conclusion is that competitiveness was put on the jeopardy...|$|R

60|$|The lion of Poitiers in {{the eyes}} of the natives is doubtless the Palais de Justice, in the shadow of which the statue-guarded hotel, just mentioned, erects itself; and the gem of the court-house, which has a prosy modern front, with pillars and a high flight of steps, is the curious salle des pas perdus, or central hall, out of which the {{different}} tribunals open. This is a feature of every French court-house, and seems the result of a conviction that a palace of justice--the French deal in much finer names than we--should be in some degree palatial. The great hall at Poitiers has a long pedigree, as its walls date back to the twelfth century and its open wooden roof, as well as the remarkable trio of chimney-pieces at the right end of the room as you enter, to the fifteenth. The three tall fireplaces, side by side, with a delicate gallery running along the top of them, constitute the originality of this ancient chamber, and make one think of the groups that must formerly have gathered there--of all the wet boot-soles, the trickling doublets, the stiffened fingers, the rheumatic shanks, that must have been presented to such an incomparable focus of heat. To-day, I am afraid, these mighty hearths are for ever cold; justice is probably administered with the aid of a modern calorifère, and the walls of the palace are perforated with regurgitating tubes. Behind and above the gallery that surmounts the three fireplaces are high Gothic windows, the tracery of which masks, in some sort, the chimneys; and in each angle of this and of the room to the right and left of the trio of chimneys is an open-work spiral staircase, ascending to--I forget where; perhaps to the roof of the edifice. The whole side of the salle is very lordly, and seems to express an unstinted hospitality, to extend the friendliest of all <b>invitations,</b> <b>to</b> <b>bid</b> the whole world come and get warm. It was the invention of John, Duke of Berry and Count of Poitou, about 1395. I give this information on the authority of the Guide-Joanne, from which source I gather much other curious learning; as, for instance, that it was in this building, when it had surely a very different front, that Charles VII. was proclaimed king in 1422; and that here Jeanne Darc was subjected, in 1429, to the inquisition of sundry doctors and matrons.|$|R
