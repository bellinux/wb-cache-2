These dispensers can be programmed {{by the pilot}} or ground crew to dispense flares in short intervals, one at a time, long intervals, or in clusters. Most currently used flares are of the pyrophoric variety, and thus the dispensers {{do not have to}} ignite and deploy the flare at the same time. With pyrotechnic flares, a lanyard automatically pulls off a <b>friction</b> <b>cap</b> covering the exposed end of the flare as it falls from the dispenser. A friction surface inside the cap rubs against the exposed end of the flare (similar to a match-head and striking surface) and ignites the flare.|$|E

On Friday, March 13, 1863, an explosion occurred in a section of the laboratory that killed forty five individuals and left twenty three others injured. Most of the killed and injured were young girls who were the labor force used on the island.|$|R
40|$|We explore in {{this paper}} how trading noise, when {{considered}} as a market friction, reacts to trading activity. Transactions cost is a good explanation for intraday trading behavior in the market according to our data. Particularly, we show that in general trading brings friction to market. However, trading friction at market open is the lowest during the day, as trading causes less friction then relatively. This {{is due to the}} behavioral difference among investors. When market opens, individual trading removes, while institutional trading brings, market friction. Situation {{in the rest of the}} day is just the opposite, where individual, instead of institutional, trading brings friction. The uneven behavior of trading noise across investors and time of day makes it a specific, rather than general, transactions cost, as opposed to Stoll (2000). Intraday trading activity suppresses both order width and depth, as proxies for trading intensity, therefore creates more noise or friction in the market. Width and depth contribute to trading noise in a polarized way, so that individual trading hurts <b>friction</b> in small <b>cap</b> stocks at open, but benefits it at close. Institutional trading brings extremely strong <b>friction</b> to large <b>cap</b> stocks, but less so at market close. So trading noise as a specific, rather than general, transactions cost is prominent only to certain investors, at certain time and for certain stocks in the market. Our findings lend itself to the justification of the new financial transactions tax proposed by the European Union. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} model for near shore wave propagation, SWAN, {{was used to}} study wave climates in Liverpool Bay, northwest England with various input parameters, including bottom <b>friction</b> factor, white <b>capping,</b> wind drag formulation and effects of tidal modulations. Results were compared with in-situ measurements and reveal the impacts from these inputs on the predictions of wave height and propagation distributions. In particular, the model results were found very sensitive to different input formulations, and tend to underestimate the wave parameters under storm conditions {{in comparison with the}} observations. It is therefore important to further validate the model against detailed field measurements, particularly under large storms that are often of the primary concer...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of how dry granulation and in particular, granule solid fraction (SF) impact the compaction behavior of plastically deformable microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), in this study, the Drucker Prager Cap (DPC) model parameters were calibrated using monodisperse MCC dry granules as model granules. Dry granules were produced as directly compressed small cylindrical compacts of MCC with SF {{in the range of}} 0. 40 to 0. 70 which were monodisperse in both size and SF. Virgin MCC powder and granules were compressed into tablets with SF in the range of 0. 70 to 0. 90. The DPC parameters (cohesion, internal <b>friction</b> angle, <b>cap</b> eccentricity, and hydrostatic yield stress), Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were experimentally determined from diametrical and uniaxial compression, and in-die compaction tests. Results showed that calibration of the shear failure surface only may be adequate for MCC granules when the DPC model is completely calibrated for virgin MCC. Increasing granule SF significantly decreased the cohesion only. All other parameters were impacted by the tablet SF only. In the 2 D yield surface, only the shear failure surface expanded as the granule SF increased. MCC of any granulation status requires the same in-die compaction stress state for densification to a given tablet solid fraction...|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with <b>friction</b> on the <b>cap</b> edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|R
40|$|Interface shear {{strength}} between concrete layers cast {{at different times}} {{plays an important role}} to provide monolithic behavior of composite concrete. In this paper, a computational modeling approach is used to study the concrete-to-concrete bond behavior between two concrete layers cast at different times; concrete base and concrete topping. The compressive strength of the concrete base is 40 N/mm 2, while the concrete topping is 25 N/mm 2. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) package ABAQUS 6. 12 is used to model the bond interaction of concrete-to-concrete layers, which is then verified with the experimental test. Four specimens with different types of surface textures are - -brushing in transverse direction and projecting steel reinforcement crossing the interface. Failure of the bonded interfaces is modeled with cohesive zone model (CZM) approach with zero thickness interface element where the governing parameters are - meanwhile, the projecting steel surface is modeled with Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap-Plasticity Model (CPM) approach with 1 mm thickness of interface element. The parameters used in the analysis include interface {{shear strength}}, fracture energy and elastic shear stiffness for CZM approach. The CPM parameters for modeling projecting steel surface are cohesion, interface <b>friction</b> angle, <b>cap</b> eccentricity parameter, initial cap yield surface position, flow stress ratio, yield stress at interface. The study shows that the difference between the modeled and experimental results is relatively small and therefore shows the capability of the finite element analysis to carry out interface analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of the compaction process specially with using high-speed tablet presses necessitates the use of robust monitoring tools during the process. The use of an instrumented compaction simulator in the early stage of development has a significant benefit for product development and scaling-up. Up to now, in tableting research rare {{attention has been paid}} to the measurement of die-wall pressure. Die-wall instrumentation would be essential to understand the deformation of particles under axial pressure during the compaction cycle. It would be also of great help to investigate particle–die-wall shear stresses or friction, which is the cause of many tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking. Purpose: To investigate the effect of compaction process variables ((pre) compression pressure, speed, ejection angle, tooling shape), formulation variables (filler, lubricant, binder, drug loading), powder physico-chemical properties (particle size and shape, water activity) on the compaction process through radial die-wall monitoring. Common tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking were also investigated. Materials and Methods: Using a fully instrumented compaction simulator, the Presster™ guided by mathematical modeling and experimental design. Materials with different compaction behaviors: viscoelastic, plastic, brittle, plastic/brittle. Results and Discussion: Regarding tablet press parameters, by increasing compaction pressure radial die-wall pressure was increased for all materials (RDP and MDP), while with increasing pre-compaction residual die-wall pressure (RDP) was decreased for plastic materials, whereas by increasing speed maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) was decreased for all materials. Plastic and brittle materials showed increased tendencies for friction because of high radial relaxation. An increasing RDP value during compaction would indicate higher tendency for friction, whereas a high constant value of MDP would provide an evidence for plastic behavior. High compaction force combined with high speed should be avoided to prevent capping. Increasing ejection angle increased friction tendencies and ejection force for powders. Effective Fall Time (EFT) derived from decompression time was a reliable tool for sticking prediction. Moreover, radial die-wall monitoring was a more sensitive tool to detect sticking in comparison to take-off force. Flat shape tooling increased radial die-wall pressure while it was reduced by concave tooling due to more homogeneity in density distribution as well as greater area of contact. However, concave tooling showed higher <b>friction</b> and <b>capping</b> in comparison to flat tooling due to more radial movement for the powder, which resulted in higher densification at the edges in comparison to flat tooling. Concerning formulation variables, additives enhancing the elasticity or weakening the bonds such as lubricants or increasing drug loading promoted the occurrence of capping, while additives improving the mechanical strength such as binders reduced capping. The RDP/MDP ratio was not suitable as a sensitive parameter for the evaluation of lubricants, since it was only changed for plastic and/or brittle materials. Also, MDP was a good predictor for axial pressure transmission to the die-wall. External lubrication reduced the die-wall-compact friction without affecting the deformation behavior of the formulation. High RDP values were not always responsible for capping, because MCC exhibited low RDP values and still showed capping, therefore, other parameters such ER 0 and tensile strength should also be considered. Regarding physico-chemical properties of powders, small / irregular particles acted more plastically at high compression, showed better axial pressure transmission, more porous and stronger compacts, and had higher tendency for friction and sticking than bigger particles. On the other hand, high water activity resulted in a low RDP and friction for all materials, and a high MDP for plastic materials. This was due to the lubricating and plasticizing effects of water, respectively. Conclusion: Radial die-wall pressure monitoring is recommended as a valuable tool to assess the deformation behavior of materials and detect friction and adhesion at early stages of development and during production as well, which would be of great help to predict common scaling-up tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking...|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== A cap gun is a toy {{gun that}} creates a loud sound {{simulating}} a gunshot and {{a puff of smoke}} when the percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic. The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of cap guns was roughly a 20-year period following World War II when television became popular and such companies as Nichols, Hubley, Kenton, Kilgore, Wyandotte, Classy, Mattel, Actoy, Esquire, George Schmidt, and Stevens made millions of cap guns in various versions. While many had their names patterned after a hero or heroine, many cap guns also were named with western-sounding names, like: [...] "Stallion 45", [...] "Pony", [...] "Mustang", [...] "Pioneer", [...] "Cowboy", [...] "Texan", [...] "Colt 45", [...] "Rodeo", and such.Ring cap guns are usually modelled after revolver pistols, with the cap ring placed in the cylinder section of the toy gun. Like its real-world counterpart, when the trigger is pulled, the cylinder rotates a new cap into place, the hammer is drawn back, and then released; the shock causes the cap to explode harmlessly, producing the noise and smoke.Strip or paper cap guns use the aforementioned cap strip in lieu of the cap ring. As in the ring style of gun, each pull of the trigger advances the cap strip forward, pulls back the hammer {{to the point where it}} releases, striking the cap.Potato or spud guns occasionally use a cap to provide a burst of gas to fire the projectile, a small cutting of potato. One design employs a small reusable metal [...] "cartridge" [...] which has a recess for a cap at one end and a small drilling through to the other end, which holds the potato. Due to the low energy contained in a paper cap and the poor seal around the cartridge, these spud guns usually have very modest range, barely enough to eject the potato cutting.Mattel introduced a modified type of roll cap that used sprocket feed instead of simple <b>friction</b> feed.Today, <b>cap</b> guns and other toy guns in the United States must be manufactured with a bright orange, red, or yellow tip placed over the [...] "muzzle" [...] of the cap gun, or with the entire gun made in these or other bright colors. Laws requiring these markings were made because of incidents where civilians - usually children or teenagers - were killed by police officers when the officers thought they saw real guns. While these incidents were rare, lawmakers decided that toy guns must be marked so they cannot be mistaken for real guns.2 It is also possible to commit acts of robbery with a replica gun, since no shots need to be fired from a gun that looks real.There are many collectors throughout the world who collect all types of cap guns, even though restrictive laws in some areas may make it difficult. Whereas the toy guns brought small prices originally, they now command significant prices for many models, with some of the most famous sets of holsters, guns and original boxes selling for high prices at auctions and toy gun shows. Some collectors will collect all types of cap guns, but many collectors specialize in either guns named after a famous western hero or a particular company's set, like the Nichols Industries or Hubley cap guns.Caps have occasionally been used in toys other than cap guns where an explosive effect is desired. One example would be the [...] "Thunder Punch" [...] version of the He-Man action figure from the original 1980s Masters of the Universe toy line. Ring caps were placed in a [...] "backpack" [...] integrated into the figure, which contained the striking mechanism for the caps (as well as tiny vents to allow smoke from a triggered cap to escape). This mechanism was triggered by drawing the figure's spring-loaded right arm back and releasing it to swing forward; the explosion of the cap was intended to simulate a thunderous noise caused by the superhuman power of the character's punch. Another example is a relatively new type of Airsoft, called Hybrid Guns. Hybrid guns use small round BBs in the tip of a casing, usually designed to mimic that of its respective magazine. The caps are placed behind the casing. In electric models, the caps are burst, and the pressure is used to propel the BB forward in a manner similar to real firearms. The leftover energy is then sometimes put to use simulating recoil and a blowback system that ejects the casings Another use is in so-called [...] "cap bombs"; devices roughly in the shape of an aerial bomb that contain a firing mechanism in the nose capable of holding a single cap, either plastic or paper (cut from a strip), though types are not interchangeable due to the mutually exclusive design. With the newer designs they have both the paper cap or plastic cap. When dropped they hit a hard surface and explode.|$|R
