40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a court’s perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> socio-legal identity {{may be affected}} by interpreting. Since this perception relies largely on language, interpreters are expected to minimise their impact on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> direct communication between primary participants. The analysis focuses on an interpreter-mediated defendant’s examination, recorded in an attempted murder case tried before the Belgian Assize Court, identifying possible departures from <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> orality and authenticity. The recordings include exchanges, not necessarily audible to the court, between <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and <b>the</b> interpreter. Our analysis shows that: (a) the participation framework (directness) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> input is altered, while <b>the</b> relative inaudibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction between <b>defendant</b> and interpreter deprives <b>the</b> jury <b>of</b> access to authentic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> delivery; (b) <b>the</b> interpreter’s intervention may shift <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> oral exposition into a different style, and hence condition <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is eventually perceived by the jury. status: publishe...|$|R
