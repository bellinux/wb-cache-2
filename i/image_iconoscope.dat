2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope</b> in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope</b> (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope</b> and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} side of the ocean, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1937 on a low-velocity {{scanning}} beam device they dubbed the orthicon. Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and deflection coils near the charge storage plate to provide auniform axial magnetic field. The orthicon was the tube used in RCA's television demonstration at the 1939 New York World's Fair, its performance was similar to the <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope's</b> one, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing [...] "the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene".|$|R
50|$|The {{iconoscope}} {{was presented}} to the general public at a press conference in June 1933, and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year. Unlike the Farnsworth image dissector, the Zworykin iconoscope was much more sensitive, useful with an illumination on the target between 4ft-c (43lx) and 20ft-c (215lx). It was also easier to manufacture and produced a very clear <b>image.</b> The <b>iconoscope</b> was the primary camera tube used by RCA broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it was replaced by the image orthicon tube.|$|R
50|$|The <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope</b> is {{essentially}} {{identical to the}} super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of {{a thin layer of}} isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted {{from the surface of the}} isolating material when the electron image reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the Atlantic Ocean, the British team formed by {{engineers}} Lubszynski, Rodda, and MacGee developed the super-emitron (also superikonoscop in Germany) in 1934, this new device is between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original emitron and iconoscope, and it was used for a public broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937. The <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope</b> was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon.|$|E
5000|$|According to Albert Abramson, Zworykin's {{experiments}} {{started in}} April 1931, {{and after the}} achievement of the first promising experimental transmitters, on October 23, 1931, it was decided that the new camera tube would be named the iconoscope. Zworykin presented his iconoscope to RCA in 1922. He continued work on it, and"the <b>image</b> <b>iconoscope,</b> presented in 1934, was a result of a collaboration between Zworykin and RCA's licensee Telefunken. ... In 1935 the Reichspost started the public broadcastings using this tube and applying a 180 lines system." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} American iconoscope was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This {{was the first time that}} anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair.On the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken.
