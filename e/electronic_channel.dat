40|$|Many {{markets that}} have {{traditionally}} relied on collocation of buyers, sellers, and products have introduced <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> Although these <b>electronic</b> <b>channels</b> may provide benefits to {{buyers and sellers}} by lowering the transaction costs of participating in the market, there are trade-offs related to quality uncertainty and increased risk that may limit {{the adoption of the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> As a result, buyers and sellers use physical channels for some transactions and <b>electronic</b> <b>channels</b> for others. These usage patterns may evolve over time, particularly when the <b>electronic</b> <b>channels</b> are new. We examine buyer and seller use of <b>electronic</b> and physical <b>channels</b> in a market for products of uncertain quality (used vehicles) over a 2. 5 -year period. Results indicate that transactions involving low quality uncertainty and relatively rare products occurred in the <b>electronic</b> <b>channels,</b> whereas transactions involving high quality uncertainty and relatively plentiful products occurred in the physical channels.

40|$|This paper explores {{why some}} retail banks are more vigorously {{promoting}} {{and have been}} more successful in changing their distribution channel structure by introducing new <b>electronic</b> <b>channels,</b> such as PC banking and internet banking, than other banks. Ten hypotheses are formulated relating a number of variables to the banks' promotion and successful introduction of the <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> Responses from 60 key managers in the largest retail banks in Denmark indicate that bank size, advantages for the customers and the banks, attention to the future, senior management support, and willingness to cannibalize existing channels may be important factors in explaining the successful introduction of the <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> Further, {{the results indicate that}} different attitudes and perceptions are related to different means of attracting customers to the <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> Finally the paper discusses the implications for the banks and other firms of adopting the Internet as a distribution <b>channel.</b> retail banking, <b>electronic</b> distribution <b>channels,</b> organization, promotion. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, online {{retailers}} (also called e-tailers) {{have started}} allowing manufacturers {{direct access to}} their customers while charging a fee for providing this access, a format {{commonly referred to as}} agency selling. In this paper, we use a stylized theoretical model to answer a key question that e-tailers are facing: When should they use an agency selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format? We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads to lower retail prices; however, the e-tailers end up giving control over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the manufacturer, who makes <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> pricing decisions based on their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar retailing), is an important factor for e-tailers to consider. We find that when sales in the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling, whereas when sales in the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> lead to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between e-tailers—as competition between them increases, e-tailers prefer to use agency selling. We also find that when e-tailers benefit from positive externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower under reselling than under agency selling, and the e-tailers prefer reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency selling without the positive externalities...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} {{the problem of the}} dynamics of adoption of electronic commerce, focusing on agents’ expertise and learning patterns in using e-markets. Traders face a double uncertainty. In the traditional channel, intrinsic frictions make uncertain the implementation of an exchange, but the quality of the traded items is perfectly observable. In the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel,</b> exchange always occurs but agents imperfectly appreciate items' quality, because traders and traded commodities are inaccurately observable on e-markets. We develop {{in this paper}} a simulation model to deal with this issue. In this model, traders are heterogeneous regarding both their preferences and their ability to trade on the electronic market. We successively sketch two scenarii: i) We first analyse a situation where learning is strictly individual. A trial-and-errors learning pattern may have an ambiguous impact. On the one hand, it is found to improve the diffusion of electronic markets. On the other hand, it may be responsible of a new source of inequalities because some agents {{may not be able to}} trade in the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> and are hence excluded from the use of this market either in the short run (temporal unemployment) or in the long run (structural unemployment). As learning is imperfect, the economy converges to a situation where the two markets coexist, inducing coordination costs (frictional unemployment). ii) We then extend our results by exploring the effects of community-based learning practices: such practices are found to enhance the adoption of the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> although inequalities among agents may increase.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{technology}} in banking is mainly felt {{in the delivery of}} banking services through <b>electronic</b> <b>channels.</b> Other than bank branches, <b>electronic</b> <b>channels</b> like ATMs, pC banking, phone banking and banking kiosks have provided other alternatives to acquire banking products and services. Nonetheless, it is not easy changing from traditional methods of banking to one that is paperless and cashless. Also, in view of the high investment cost of operating <b>electronic</b> <b>channels,</b> the return is in fact, uncertain. Therefore, the question now is what would it take to bring about success in implementing <b>electronic</b> distribution <b>channels?</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out how <b>electronic</b> <b>channels</b> can be implemented successfully by domestic commercial banks in Malaysia. In order to do so, data is collecetd by self-administrated questionnaires distributed to all the domestic commercial banks in Malaysia. Data collected are analysed by means of primary statistics such as frequency, mean and mode analysis, as well as factor and Spearman correlation analysis. The factor analysis conducted indicated that banks' operation management is the main factors affecting the success of ATMs, PC and branch banking, while product innovation and knowledge development factor are found to have the most effect on the success of banking kiosks and phone banking, respectively. So to determine the association of success factors of each distribution channel, the Spearman's rank correlation is conducted but there was no significant correlation for factors identified under phone banking and branch networks. However, planning and control factor of banking kiosks is found to have an inverse association with product innovation and knowledge development factor. Besides, internal planning and control factor is discovered to cause constrain to product innovation and knowledge development in PC banking...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{innovations}} in e-commerce have {{lead to the}} emergence of platforms, which manufacturers can use to directly reach out to customers. In this paper we analyze under what market conditions should e-tailers set up e-commerce platforms instead of entering in a more conventional reseller agreement with manufacturers. We use a theoretical model to capture the effect that various factors like market competition and interaction with traditional channel have on this decision. Our results suggest that whenever the e-channel leads to cannibalization in traditional retail, setting up a platform is more profitable for the e-tailers, whereas, when the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> leads to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, the e-tailers should enter into a reseller contract with the manufacturer. This change in preference is moderated by competition and as the competition increases, the e-tailers prefer to set up platforms. We also identify conditions under which all markets participants are better off when platforms are used. Finally, we analyze the effect that a new entrant has on existing e-channel structure and show that entry can disrupt existing channel structures. Surprisingly, we find that under some conditions consumers might face higher prices in the <b>electronic</b> <b>channel</b> when there are competing e-tailers as opposed to a monopolistic e-tailer...|$|E
