6000|$|... "I don't feel serene, and that's why I came. You know Agatha {{better than}} anybody else. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> her recently?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I?" [...] he answered. And {{becoming}} grave again, added: [...] "Except on Judge Whipple's account. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him to-day, Carl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are safe}} from interruption," [...] he panted. [...] "I have hastened here, for every second may be invaluable. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>from</b> the king?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "and {{since the}} two Q's, as I suppose one might almost call them, went to Australia, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>from</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGOYNE (looking at {{him with}} {{suppressed}} anger). Nothing--except to save our own necks, perhaps. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the news <b>from</b> Springtown? ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} {{rendered}} uneasy by {{an account of}} the Lisbon packet's non-arrival, lest Southey should have been on board it. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him lately? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] he replied. [...] "My {{business}} makes {{it necessary for}} me to be always on the go. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your brother lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was not convinced. [...] "Vange is very dull," [...] he said, obstinately; [...] "and {{your friends}} will be {{wanting to see}} you. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your mother lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> {{your mother}} about that young rascal who ran into {{her with his}} bicycle in London some time ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Cheveleigh?' he said, {{in answer}} to their {{astonished}} greetings, producing a note, which was eagerly read:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> my uncle,' {{continued}} he, laughing; 'and if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> somebody else, of {{my little}} scrape. A fool and his money, you know, Caroline, {{and a short}} reign and a merry one. When we get prudent we are wondrous fond of proverbs. My reign has certainly been brief enough; {{with regard to the}} merriment, that is not quite so certain. I have little to regret except your society, sweet coz!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see I have {{surprised}} you," [...] he said. [...] "You are looking, I suppose, for somebody else? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Allan? Is he {{on his way}} home again already?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of you very often, Duke," [...] she said. [...] "Your brother, Lord Ronald, took us down to Norfolk, you know. By the by, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She was silent. Then, [...] "The {{conversation}} has {{got back}} into the old quarter," [...] she said. [...] "You are talking about me again. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your friends since they went away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I heard {{mentioned}} severe illness--paralytic affection; but as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Miss Clara, I hope {{it may be}} of no importance.' ...|$|R
60|$|I hope I shall {{find you}} and Mrs. H., etc., well in London, and that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> {{something}} <b>from</b> this dilatory gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "One would {{certainly}} fancy that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> quite enough already--but I wonder if {{one might ask}} <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Reggie lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He has when Mrs. Stanhope is {{not feeling}} well. The {{stronger}} she is, the less {{he seems to}} affect her. By the way, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> old Crabtree since he was let out of jail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; they've {{come back}} from the emerald valleys of Cashmere, and Alethea has {{actually}} sent me a primrose--just like an English one--that they found growing there. They did enjoy it so. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Maurice?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} with you, Sydney?" [...] he asked. [...] "You are duller than ever. I am {{positively}} {{not going to sit}} here and mumble about the weather. How are the Carooms? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> them lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's curious <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> nothing <b>from</b> Regina {{since you}} sent up those clothes," [...] he remarked. [...] "It looked pretty bad for Prescott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; Lufton was down. He {{started for}} Norway this morning. I {{want to see}} your brother. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him yourself, have you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it may be}} appeased. If {{my father}} <b>has</b> done <b>you</b> this injustice, show him how an Indian can forgive an injury, and take back his daughters. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Major Heyward--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "was {{over six}} feet, and broad! It was not he. It {{may have been}} some one whom he sent, but it was not he. Guy, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him? Do you know where he is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{you are a}} woman, and {{the blood}} of some of your {{ancestors}} will make itself felt," [...] he added, looking at her thoughtfully. [...] "I ought to have considered the influence of sex and heredity. By the bye, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Henri lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't see {{him after}} the shots were fired. I only know {{it was he who}} called {{attention}} to the sentinel, and but for him it is almost certain no disturbance would have taken place at the Custom House. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MADAM--So long a time <b>has</b> {{passed since}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> me that I almost shrink from writing to you. I am afraid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> already given {{me up in}} your own mind as a hard-hearted, ungrateful woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Affleck," [...] he said, [...] "has {{there been}} any disagreement, or <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> any word <b>from</b> Merton or Mrs. Chance which might <b>have</b> led <b>you</b> {{to think that they}} {{contemplated}} breaking off their acquaintance with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 239. For {{consider}} of it yourselves. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>from</b> your youth up (and all educated {{persons have}} heard for three centuries), of this Last Judgment of his, {{as the most}} sublime picture in existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "'O fie!' says she, {{putting up}} the prettiest little {{fingers to the}} prettiest little rosy ears in the world. 'O fie, sir! to use such naughty words. 'Tis lucky the Captain is not here, because he might quarrel with you; and Mr. George is so peaceable and quiet, that he won't. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the Captain, Mr. George?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then how," [...] she said, sternly, [...] "does {{it happen}} {{that in every}} town and village, almost, there are houses that you can hardly hire anybody to live in, because people say they are haunted? No, Mr. Hewson, it's very kind of you, and I {{appreciate}} it, but you can't make me believe that it will ever blow over, about St. Johnswort. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mr. St. John since?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how is good Mr. Gilmore?" [...] he began, {{all in a}} {{glow with}} {{the warmth of his}} own amiability. [...] "Glad to see you, sir, in such {{excellent}} health. I was passing your door, and I thought I would look in in case you might have something to say to me. Do--now pray do let us settle this little difference of ours by word of mouth, if we can! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your client yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now {{you think}} it {{a sign of a}} fine gentleman to go and talk openly at a club about matters which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> me in confidence! I don't. I think it a very--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Aldo. [Aside.] I {{thought as}} much; he has me already!--But pray, sir, why this {{ceremony}} amongst friends? Put on, put on; {{and let us}} hear what news <b>from</b> France. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> lately <b>from</b> my son? does he continue still the most hopeful and esteemed young gentleman in Paris? does he manage his allowance with the same discretion? and, lastly, has he still the same respect and duty for his good old father? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the reasons}} which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Ducaine himself," [...] he said drily, [...] "I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that he was mistaken in his suggestion. I think that you will probably be inclined to agree with me." ...|$|R
