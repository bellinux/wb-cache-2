25|$|Though the French {{occupied}} Lisbon without {{firing a}} shot, their quarry had escaped. As Junot's army loomed closer, the Prince Regent <b>dithered</b> between offering complete submission and fleeing to Brazil. Finally, Admiral Smith produced a 13 October {{edition of the}} Paris Moniteur which declared that the House of Braganza had been deposed. At this, John {{made up his mind}} to escape. He loaded his family, courtiers, state papers, and treasure aboard the fleet. He was joined in flight by many nobles, merchants, and others. With 15 warships and more than 20 transports, the fleet of refugees weighed anchor on 29 November and set sail for the colony of Brazil. The flight had been so chaotic that 14 carts loaded with treasure were left behind on the docks.|$|E
25|$|While Infantado <b>dithered,</b> Joseph and Jourdan moved swiftly {{against the}} local insurrections. The 27th Light Infantry {{put down the}} {{rebellion}} in Chinchón with extreme brutality; all {{the men in the}} town were massacred. Colmenar Viejo suffered also, with numerous inhabitants being executed. Joseph ordered Victor to shift east from Aranjuez to Arganda del Rey to block the road from Tarancón. On 8 January, the division of Dessolles arrived in Madrid followed in two days by the return of the IV Corps from Ávila. These heavy reinforcements allowed Napoleon's defensive scheme around Madrid to be reestablished. Reinforced by the Dutch Brigade, Leval's division was sent to garrison Talavera while Valence's division was ordered to hold Toledo. The divisions of Dessolles and Sébastiani became the Madrid garrison. Victor was sent Ruffin's division as a reinforcement and ordered to attack.|$|E

25|$|Undeterred, Jourdan {{spent one}} day reorganizing his {{defeated}} army and then advanced across the Sambre on 18 June, reinvesting Charleroi. The Prince of Orange's troops took position at Rouveroy {{to the west}} of Charleroi while Johann Peter Beaulieu's division blocked the road to the north at Quatre Bras. The overall Coalition commander Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld <b>dithered</b> over what to do, then finally decided to help the Prince of Orange. When Coburg's 52,000-man army reached the scene, it was too late; Charleroi had surrendered to the French. As on the 16th, Jourdan's 75,000 troops formed a semi-circle around Charleroi. In the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794 Coburg formed his army into five attacking columns. Dubois' cavalry was positioned near Ransart behind the center together with Jacques Maurice Hatry's infantry division. Again, Jourdan's right flank was swept away by the Coalition attack. Lefebvre wheeled back the right flank of his division and placed it under the orders of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Some soldiers and cannons from the routed right wing rallied on it. Jourdan issued orders for a retreat but, finding that Lefebvre was still holding on, he countermanded the order. Championnet's division had just begun pulling out. Jourdan directed Dubois' cavalry to charge the enemy; the horsemen were repulsed, but Championnet's foot soldiers attacked next and regained their former positions. After a see-saw struggle on the left flank, the French managed to hold their ground there also. Coburg in person hurled his battalions at Lefebvre but every assault was beaten back. That evening Coburg conceded victory to the French and retreated to Braine-l'Alleud.|$|E

As Dexter <b>dithered,</b> Republicans tried to get General George Patton to run, though they were not certain if the general was a Republican.

40|$|A multi-color <b>dithering</b> {{algorithm}} is proposed, which converts a barycentric combination of color intensities into a multi-color nonoverlapping surface coverage.

500|$|The Jaguar {{version was}} noted by critics as having {{problems}} such as slowdown and lack of a save option, although some liked the graphics and gameplay. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the game itself is great fun, but that the Jaguar conversion had confusing menus and <b>dithered</b> text which is excessively difficult to read. GamePro echoed these criticisms and further stated that the Jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown. They summarised that [...] "Ocean didn't work hard enough to make Theme Park look and sound good on the Jaguar". A reviewer for Next Generation took the reverse position, saying that the Jaguar conversion [...] "is seamless" [...] and the game itself was mediocre. Their elaboration was that [...] "Slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving the addictiveness of the other 'god' games, and most players will find themselves bored before they've even run {{through all of the}} options". German magazine Atari Insides reviewer complimented the addictiveness, but the lack of save opportunities was criticised, and a reviewer from ST Computer believed the game's complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive. Mega Funs main criticism of the Jaguar version was its inability to save in-game.|$|E

5000|$|An {{audio signal}} of very low level (with {{respect to the}} bit depth of the ADC) sampled without <b>dither</b> sounds {{extremely}} distorted and unpleasant. Without <b>dither</b> the low level may cause the least significant bit to [...] "stick" [...] at 0 or 1. With <b>dithering,</b> the true level of the audio may be calculated by averaging the actual quantized sample {{with a series of}} other samples <b>dither</b> that are recorded over time. A virtually identical process, also called <b>dither</b> or <b>dithering,</b> is often used when quantizing photographic images to a fewer number of bits per pixel—the image becomes noisier but to the eye looks far more realistic than the quantized image, which otherwise becomes banded. This analogous process may help to visualize the effect of <b>dither</b> on an analogue audio signal that is converted to digital. <b>Dithering</b> is also used in integrating systems such as electricity meters. Since the values are added together, the <b>dithering</b> produces results that are more exact than the LSB of the analog-to-digital converter. Note that <b>dither</b> can only increase the resolution of a sampler, it cannot improve the linearity, and thus accuracy does not necessarily improve.|$|R

Simultaneously, Papen had been working behind the scenes and used his personal friendship with Hindenburg to assure the president that he, Papen, could control Hitler and could thus finally form a government that would not be defeated on a vote of no confidence from the Reichstag, as his government had suffered in September 1932.|$|E

2500|$|In the Catholic South, William's {{policies}} were unpopular.

Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect ("Flemish") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army. [...] Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce.
