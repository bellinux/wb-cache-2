5|$|Cacti {{are often}} <b>grown</b> in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or <b>grown</b> in the ground. Cacti are also <b>grown</b> as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, three {{cuttings}} of Carménère were {{imported from}} Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart {{in the late}} 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds <b>grown</b> on nutrient gel) and field <b>grown</b> by Narromine Vine Nursery. The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by Amietta Vineyard and Winery in the Moorabool Valley (Geelong, Victoria) who use Carménère in their Angels' Share blend.|$|E

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally <b>grown</b> using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, {{only a small portion of}} those <b>grown</b> in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E

5|$|Plants <b>grown</b> under UVB light {{are more}} {{resistant}} to insect herbivory compared with plants <b>grown</b> under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. Rice cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was <b>grown</b> extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also <b>grown</b> and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was <b>grown</b> as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E

5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are <b>grown</b> and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes <b>grown</b> as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are <b>grown</b> for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be <b>grown</b> for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
