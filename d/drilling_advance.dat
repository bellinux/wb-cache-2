It is being performed through joint finding from the Department of Energy Geothermal Division and the Natural Gas Technology Branch, Morgantown Energy Technology Center. Interest in <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> systems is high. The Geothermal Division of the Department of Energy has initiated a multi-year effort in the development of <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> systems; the National Research Council completed a study of drilling and excavation technologies last year; and the MIT Energy Laboratory recently submitted a proposal for a national initiative in <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> and excavation research. The primary reasons for this interest are financial. Worldwide expenditures on oil and gas drilling approach $ 75 billion per year. Also, drilling and well completion account for 25 % to 50 % of the cost of producing electricity from geothermal energy. There is incentive to search for methods to reduce the cost of drilling. Work on ideas to improve or replace rotary drilling technology dates back at least to the 1930 `s. There was a significant amount of work in this area in the 1960 `s and 1970 `s; and there has been some continued effort through the 1980 `s. Undoubtedly there are concepts for <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> systems that have yet to be studied; however, it is almost certain that new efforts to initiate work on <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> systems will build on an idea or a variation of an idea that has already been investigated. Therefore, a review of previous efforts coupled with a characterization of viable <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling</b> systems and the current state of technology as it applies to those systems provide the basis for the current study of <b>advanced</b> <b>drilling...</b>|$|R

Again like the previous day the drill continued to get stuck, refusing to go any further. Scott was able to advance a few centimeters by pulling the drill up to clear the flutes on the drill bit and then letting the <b>drill</b> <b>advance</b> only using its own weight. This process however would cause the drill bit sections to come apart, meaning that what Scott was really doing was creating a new obstruction below the surface without realizing it. When he tried to emplace the probes they only went in 3 ft (1 m). Post-flight analysis would find that the drill design was flawed, with the flutes too close together at the joint joining the sections of the stem.|$|R

40|$|Provision of {{machining}} accuracy is a relevant objective in technology {{of mechanical engineering}} and its solution allows to guarantee an operational accuracy of mechanisms and machines, their wear resistance, reliability and durability. In order to solve the given task a method has been proposed {{in the paper that}} permits to ensure the highest {{machining accuracy}} margin on the basis of multiple-factor optimization of parameters for technological process while using methods of artificial intelligence. To ensure the machining accuracy by point tools, an intellectual system has been developed and it is based on technologies of functional semantic networks. For revealing correctness of SEMANTIC intellectual system operation an experimental inspection of its working capacity has been carried out in the paper. The paper contains description of the methodology for In article the technique of experimental investigations and their purpose is to make a comparative analysis of actual errors in opening machining with the machining errors predicted by the SEMANTIC system on the basis of functional semantic network application. The investigations have made it possible to determine dependences of axial misalignment in the machined openings on tool advance and its rotation frequency while making openings by high-speed steel drills. The paper presents analysis results of limiting and probable values for components of a total machining error. It has been shown that while making assessment of machining accuracy it is necessary to consider probabilistic nature of occurrence of total error components that are setting upper boundary as it is realized in the described intellectual system. The semantic network permits to compare errors in arrangement of opening axes which are machined in accordance with admissible <b>drill</b> <b>advance</b> and rotation frequency and corresponding experimental values.
