40|$|Borrowing {{from the}} rent {{dissipation}} literature that has proven useful in patent analysis, in this Article I provide an economic foundation for copyright’s <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> to prepare sequels and adaptations and suggest a straightforward doctrinal test for that right. I {{argue that the}} suppression of competition in creating adaptations of the same copyrighted expression, rather than being a loss, might instead be the derivative right’s chief economic virtue, giving an author control over adaptations and limiting the production of those that would be close substitutes for one another. In Part I, I explain and question the conventional justification of the <b>derivative</b> <b>right,</b> that the right provides incentives to create copyrighted works. I argue that rather than maximizing {{the total number of}} works the <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> probably greatly decreases the number of derivative works, but also that some works may be more important than others, in part because works that are close substitutes for one another are of relatively little value. Part II reviews the recent literature applying product differentiation theory to copyright and points to an additional area of the economic literature that may provide a more fruitful model for considering the <b>derivative</b> <b>right.</b> I suggest that product differentiation logic applies particularly forcefully to discrete submarkets in which there would be a large amount of demand diversion, as would be the case if no <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> existed. Finally, in Part III I argue that regardless of whether the <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> in its current form is normatively justified it requires a conceptual economic foundation to restrict its doctrinal contours. I thus offer a doctrinal approach for assessing the derivative and reproduction right, apply the test to some actual cases and controversies, and comment on the related doctrine concerning the standard for copyrightability of derivative works...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{operational}} matrices {{of the left}} Caputo fractional <b>derivative,</b> <b>right</b> Caputo fractional derivative and Riemann–Liouville fractional integral for shifted Legendre polynomials. We develop an accurate numerical algorithm to solve the two-sided space–time fractional advection–dispersion equation (FADE) based on a spectral shifted Legendre tau (SLT) method {{in combination with the}} derived shifted Legendre operational matrices. The fractional derivatives are described in the Caputo sense. We propose a spectral SLT method, both in temporal and spatial discretizations for the two-sided space–time FADE. This technique reduces the two-sided space–time FADE to a system of algebraic equations that simplifies the problem. Numerical results carried out to confirm the spectral accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. By selecting relatively few Legendre polynomial degrees, we are able to get very accurate approximations, demonstrating the utility of the new approach over other numerical methods...|$|E

We propose an accurate and efficient spectral algorithm for the numerical {{solution of the}} two-sided space–time Caputo fractionalorder telegraph equation with three types of non-homogeneous boundary conditions, namely, Dirichlet, Robin, and non-local conditions. The proposed algorithm is based on shifted Chebyshev tau technique combined with the derived shifted Chebyshev operational matrices. We focus primarily on implementing the novel algorithm both in temporal and spatial discretizations. This algorithm reduces the problem {{to a system of}} algebraic equations greatly simplifying the problem. This system can be solved by any standard iteration method. For confirming the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme, we introduce some numerical examples with their approximate solutions and compare our results with those achieved using other methods. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

While the emergence of access to information legislation in Canadian jurisdictions reflected important public policy decisions that providing access to information promotes good government, the courts had always recognized {{that there was no}} constitutional right to require the government to disclose information in its possession. In Criminal Lawyers’ Assn. v. Ontario (Ministry of Public Safety and Security) the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously reached the novel conclusion that the right to freedom of information protected by section 2 (b) of the Charter contained, in limited circumstances, a <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> to government information. The new right to government information recognized by the Court is an extremely narrow right, limited to situations “where access is necessary to permit meaningful discussion on a matter of public importance, subject to privileges and functional constraints”.

The main purpose of the recognition of the human right to water is to guarantee to everyone access to sufficient, safe and affordable drinking water to satisfy personal and domestic uses. This book discusses whether the human right to water is recognised as a <b>derivative</b> <b>right</b> or as an independent right at three levels – universal, regional and domestic - where human rights are acknowledged and enforced. For national law a case study approach has been used with focus on Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia. Additionally, the human right to water is examined in a transboundary water context, where the use and management of an international watercourse in one riparian state can directly or indirectly affect the human right to water in another riparian state. For this reason, this book analyses whether the core principles of international water law contribute to the realisation of the extraterritorial application of the right to water...|$|E

40|$|Rural {{property}} mortgage financing, as {{an important}} breakthrough to deepen the reform of rural property right system and financial system, is an important approach to increase the farmers’ property income. Besides, rural property mortgage financing is of great significance in implementing the rural land usufructuary right and meeting the demand of medium-and-long-term and large-scale operation of the funds used in agricultural production. Under the existing institutional arrangement, the property mortgage financing {{in the rural areas}} of our country still is faced with many obstacles, and it is still at the stage of low level development. In this paper, closely based on the acceptability and the difficulty in the mortgaged property involving in legal disposal, the author puts forward important methods: clearly define the ownership, unify the urban and rural markets, increase the participation enthusiasm of financing bodies, and improve the supporting policies to promote property mortgage financing in rural area. Finally, the government should give farmers more property rights and revitalize the usufructuary right of agricultural land and its <b>derivative</b> <b>right...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{human right}} to water is {{nowadays}} more broadly recognised, mainly {{due to the}} essential societal function that this resource plays; likewise, because of the present water scarcity is generating conflicts between its different uses. Thus, this right aims at protecting human beings by guaranteeing access to clean water that is essential to satisfy vital human needs. Similarly, access to clean water is an important element to guarantee other rights {{including the right to}} life and health. The recognition of the right to water is mainly achieved in two ways: as a new and independent right and as a subordinate or <b>derivative</b> <b>right.</b> Concerning the latter, the right to water can emanate from civil and political rights, such as the right to life; or can be derived from economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to health, the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to housing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to assess {{whether or not there}} is a universal human right to water. The problem of water scarcity and high death rates due to a lack of access to clean water is still prevalent across the globe today, making it hard to believe that a human right to water is still not codified in international law. This dissertation analyses international as well as national law to assess whether a human right to water is universally acknowledged by the international community despite not being codified. It is argued, that there is still no explicit universal human right to water in international law. However, this dissertation acknowledges that a human right to water does exist as a derivate right, which is almost universally acknowledged. As a <b>derivative</b> <b>right,</b> it is, however, not as equally strong as explicitly acknowledged rights in the core international human rights instruments. This dissertation also provides a brief overview of corporate involvement under the human right to water. An assessment is made as to whether or not international law imposes direct obligations and responsibilities on companies. It is argued in this dissertation that companies have a particular responsibility for the implementation of the human right to water despite states remaining the primary subjects responsible...|$|E

40|$|Part I of this Article {{explains}} that, {{viewed in}} light of the evolution of the derivative work concept in the copyright revision process, the exclusive <b>right</b> to prepare <b>derivative</b> works is narrower in scope and more bounded than commentators have often feared. Part II considers characteristics of the nine exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition and explains why they should inform a sound interpretation of the last clause in the definition. By including these nine examples, Congress intended to provide guidance about the types of derivatives covered by this right. To be consistent with the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the constitutional purpose of copyright, derivative work liability should only be imposed under the last clause of the definition if the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim is analogous to {{one or more of the}} exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition. Part III discusses three plausible justifications for the grant of the <b>derivative</b> work <b>right</b> that, properly understood, constrain its reach. Part IV considers several provisions and doctrines of U. S. copyright law that further limit the reach of the <b>derivative</b> work <b>right.</b> The statutory exclusion of useful articles from the scope of copyright protection, for instance, meaningfully limits the <b>derivative</b> work <b>right</b> in a manner consistent with the constitutional purpose of copyright law and policies favoring ongoing innovation and competition. Fair use protects free-expression interests of next-generation authors, along with the first-sale limit, which protects privacy and autonomy interests of those who have purchased copies of copyrighted works.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is justice and asylum. The central {{argument}} in the thesis is that citizens of all states have a moral right that entitles them to asylum in certain circumstances of deprivation. The right to asylum {{can be understood as}} a general <b>derivative</b> <b>right,</b> and it is grounded in the more fundamental entitlement to basic needs. More specifically, I argue that all persons whose basic needs are insufficiently protected in their home states have the right to asylum when they cannot be assisted with other remedial instruments by the international community within a reasonable timeframe. By using the right to asylum as a normative evaluative standard, I also argue that the existing refugee protective institutions are morally unsatisfactory, and that a 'moral refugee regime' should be established to replace the current protective institutions. Then the questions becomes, what specific form these institutions should take. In the thesis I focus primarily on one institutional proposal, 'the tradable quota scheme', and its ethical dimensions. I defend the tradable quota scheme against several lines of criticism, and suggest that the scheme constitutes a normatively viable alternative for the existing institutional framework. Finally, I examine obligations in the protection of the right to asylum in circumstances of partial compliance. I conclude that the citizens of complying states have the obligation to 'pick up the slack' and assist those bearers of the right to asylum who are unjustly denied assistance by the non-complying states.

40|$|The {{right to}} privacy is {{presented}} as a right to a state of non-intrusion in the control an individual has over personal information, and the means of access to such information. This account of the right helps to show that the Warren and Brandeis account of the {{right to privacy}} in torts is best seen as presenting the right as simply one of the cluster composing the right to be let alone, not as simply identifying the two. The state of non-intrusion account is shown to be justified by reference to the respect for, and recognition of, the nature of persons as separate moral entities. That the right is justified in this manner indicates the attempts in the legal literature to tie the legal right to privacy to already established concepts in the law, both tort and constitutional, is wrong-headed. Rather, many of the already established legal concepts can be shown to arise from concerns for privacy. Since the right to privacy as defined above draws its justification from the feature of persons as separate moral entities, accounts of the right as a <b>derivative</b> <b>right,</b> where derivative is taken to mean either the rights in the cluster are not sui generis or that the right is only justified in reference to other goods or values, are seen to be in error. This justification also {{plays an important role in}} indicating accounts of this right as a property right suffer from a deficiency so severe such accounts must be rejected. A property right account simply cannot capture adequately the import of such a justification. Such an account also clearly precludes the possibility the right to privacy is an autonomy right. There is simply no reason to think invasions of privacy significantly restrict one's range of significant choice. These considerations lead to the proposed account of the right as specified above, an account which is a natural extension of exclusive access and selective disclosure accounts...|$|E
40|$|What 2 ̆ 7 s Really Wrong With Compelled Association? The article {{presents}} an original {{account of the}} value of freedom of association, one more intimately tied to freedom of speech values than the models of association implicit in much commentary and in such U. S. Supreme Court cases as Boy Scouts v. Dale and Roberts v. U. S. Jaycees. Standard models view the relationship between associations and free speech as instrumental. On these accounts, voluntary associations serve as sites for individuals with a defined point of view to congregate together and make their communication louder and more effective. While voluntary associations may sometimes serve this purpose, this model is overly narrow in two respects: it assumes individuals come to associations with previously formed messages and it assumes that associations seek an audience outside themselves to whom these shared messages are directed. The paper argues that in associations, individuals influence each other 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts and ideas. Thus, the focus of voluntary associations may well be internal and its message, if any, not defined prior to members’ interactions. Thinking of associations as a site for idea generation and mutual influence suggests a much tighter, less instrumental connection between associational freedom and freedom of speech; what and how individuals think is often a product of their relations, not prior to them. On this account, voluntary associations {{are a part of the}} network of social cooperation and connection that play an integral role in supporting and producing meaningful individual autonomy in liberal societies. Hence, freedom of association is at the core of freedom of speech and not merely a peripheral, <b>derivative</b> <b>right.</b> This theoretical argument is pursued through an analysis of Boy Scouts v. Dale. I argue that the issue should not have been whether the gay Scoutmaster 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion would alter the association 2 ̆ 7 s message. The freedom of speech interest does not depend upon whether the association ever forms a unitary message that it broadcasts outward or inward. The last section of the article argues, however, that while voluntary, non-commercial associations of adults should enjoy a fairly absolute right to exclude unwanted members, that there was a significant and unscrutinized assumption in Dale, namely that the same standard applies to associations of children as applies to voluntary associations of adults. If the Boy Scouts had been an association of adults, then the outcome in Dale would have been correct, although not for the majority’s reasons. But given that children’s constitutional rights are not afforded the same protection and given the powerful interest in exposing children to a wide range of experiences and sources of ideas to prepare them for autonomous adulthood, Dale may have been wrongly decided. Mandatory integration of children’s associations may be constitutional even though forced integration of adults’ associations would not be...|$|E
