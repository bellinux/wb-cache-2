A Scheffler reflector is a parabolic dish that uses single axis tracking to follow the Sun's daily course. These reflectors have a flexible reflective surface that is able to change its curvature to adjust to seasonal variations in the incident angle of sunlight. Scheffler reflectors {{have the advantage of}} having a <b>fixed</b> <b>focal</b> point which improves the ease of cooking and are able to reach temperatures of 450-650°C. Built in 1999 by the Brahma Kumaris, the world's largest Scheffler reflector system in Abu Road, Rajasthan India is capable of cooking up to 35,000 meals a day. By early 2008, over 2000 large cookers of the Scheffler design had been built worldwide.|$|E

The paraboloid focuses through a central hole in the feed flat to a convenient distance behind the flat. No spider vanes or Newtonian secondary fold mirrors are required in this configuration. This eliminates vane diffraction and blockage, as well as secondary mirror scattering and absorption, thus improving image brightness and contrast.|$|R

5000|$|Good-quality lenses with maximum {{aperture}} {{no greater}} than f/2.8 and <b>fixed,</b> normal, <b>focal</b> length {{need at least}} three (triplet) or four elements (the trade name [...] "Tessar" [...] derives from the Greek tessera, meaning [...] "four").

The introduction many years ago of optical coatings, and advances in coating technology over the years, have resulted in major improvements, and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast, although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements (all other factors such as aperture, focal length, and coatings being equal).|$|R

The complementarity of PALM and SOFI was assessed in detail with a methodology that integrates a quantitative resolution and signal-to-noise metric.

5000|$|Also, when {{considering}} lens design, the [...] "APO" [...] designation is used more conservatively in astronomy-related optics (e.g. telescopes) and microscopy than in photography. For example, telescopes that are marked [...] "APO" [...] are specialized, <b>fixed</b> <b>focal</b> length lenses that are optimised for infinity-like distances whereas in photography, even certain relatively low-priced general-purpose zoom lenses {{are given the}} APO designation.|$|E
50|$|Designers of zoom lenses {{with large}} zoom ratios often trade {{one or more}} aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, {{a greater degree of}} barrel and pincushion {{distortion}} is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a <b>fixed</b> <b>focal</b> length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in <b>fixed</b> <b>focal</b> length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Conventional {{stereoscopic}} displays require {{viewers to}} unnaturally keep eye accommo-dation <b>fixed</b> at one <b>focal</b> distance while they dynamically change vergence to view objects at different distances. This forced decoupling of reflexively linked processes fatigues eyes, causes discomfort, compromises image quality, and {{may lead to}} pathologies in developing visual systems. Volumetric displays can overcome this conflict, but only for small objects placed within a limited range of viewing distances and accommodation levels, and cannot render occlusion cues correctly. Our multi-planar True 3 -D displays generate accommodation cues that match vergence and stereoscopic retinal dispar-ity demands and can display images and objects at viewing distances throughout {{the full range of}} human accommodation (from 6. 25 cm to infinity), better mimicking natural vision and minimizing eye fatigue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} first the {{uniqueness}} of the selfcalibration of a rotating and zooming camera theoretically. We assume that the principal point and the aspect ratio are <b>fixed</b> but the <b>focal</b> length changes as the camera moves. In this case, at least one inter-image homography is required in order to compute the internal calibration parameters as well as the rotation. Secondly, we analyze the effects of the deviation of the principal point on the estimation of the focal length and the rotation. The more the camera changes its zoom, the larger the effects are, and the larger the rotation angle is, the smaller the effects are. Thus, we may take the image center as the principal point in practical applications. Experiments using real images are given...|$|R

The resulting 1 D focusing element demagnifies the tube focal spot into an image line with its width and position following from a classical imaging equation. While the tube and the image (´focal´) position are kept <b>fixed,</b> the <b>focal</b> length and axial position of the mirror are adaptively controlled for different geometries, which results in a 1 D zoom-optical system. The specimen {{is placed in the}} high-depth focal region of the condensed beam for the CT-scanning procedure with the slice orientation given by the focusing direction. The reflected X-ray beam has a sheet-like geometry throughout the focal region, which can be further used for parallel projection data acquisition along the nonfocusing direction of the optical system. Multilayer reflection inherently results in a small energy bandpass of photon energies. The pass energy may be tuned to characteristic lines of the tubes in use or- with lower photon flux- through the white X-ray spectrum.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the third {{integral}} of motion has been studied for decades. Its existence was determined {{at the beginning of}} numerical experiments with orbits in an axisymmetric potential and by observations of triaxiality in the velocity dispersion of nearby stars. In general {{it is not possible to}} derive an exact expression for a general axisymmetric potential analytically. One way to find an exact third integral of motion is to approximate the gravitational potential with a potential of the Stäckel form. In addition to the third integral of motion, another important property of the Stäckel potential is that it separates the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in confocal spheroidal coordinates. This results in an alignment of the velocity ellipsoid with the spheroidal coordinate system in the meridional plane. In this thesis we construct a Stäckel model, <b>fixing</b> the <b>focal</b> point of these coordinates based on recent observations of the velocity ellipsoid (Binney et al. 2014 a). The aim of this PhD thesis is to show how a universal Stäckel potential works. This Stäckel model is focused on the region of the extended solar neighbourhood, up to 2 kpc radius around the Sun. The free parameters are constrained with the observational values of the local volume and surface density. Studying the vertical structure we can predict the behaviour of the local vertical force and radial dependencies at 1. 1 kpc far from the plane. The value of the focal point is very important, because for different values we obtain different profiles for the radial density, different values for the scale length and different behaviour for the vertical force at large heights. We derive again the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane based on RAVE data. The result for the tilt angle is in agreement with Binney et al. (2014 a), both for the complete sample of red clump giants and also for different metallicities. This result is a confirmation of the derived Stäckel model...|$|R
40|$|Presented for {{the first}} time, {{to the best of}} the authors ´ knowledge, is the design of a power smart in-door optical {{wireless}} link that provides lossless beam propagation between Transmitter (T) and Receiver (R) for changing link distances. Each T/R unit uses a combination of <b>fixed</b> and variable <b>focal</b> length optics to smartly adjust the laser beam propagation parameters of minimum beam waist size and its location to produce the optimal zero propagation loss coupling condition at the R for that link distance. An Electronically Controlled Variable Focus Lens (ECVFL) is used to form the wide field-of-view search beam and change the beam size at R to form a low loss beam. The T/R unit can also deploy camera optics and thermal energy harvesting electronics to improve link operational smartness and efficiency. To demonstrate the principles of the beam conditioned low loss indoor link, a visible 633 nm laser link using an electro-wetting technology liquid ECVFL is demon-strated for a variable 1 to 4 m link range.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies by means of optimisation tools {{is one of the}} current topics of solar thermal researchers. Of these technologies, Linear Fresnel collectors (LFCs) are the least developed. Therefore, there is plenty of room for the optimisation of this technology. One of the goals of this paper, in addition to the optimisation of an LFC plant, is introducing an applicable optimisation procedure that can be applied for any type of CSP plant. This paper focuses on harvesting maximum solar energy (maximising plant optical efficiency), as well as minimising plant thermal heat loss (maximising plant thermal efficiency), and plant cost (the economic optimisation of the plant), which leads to the generation of cheaper solar electricity from an LFC plant with a fixed power plant cycle (The performance optimisation of this study is based on the plant performance throughout an imaginary summer day). A multi-tube cavity receiver is considered in this study since there is plenty of room for its optimization. For the receiver, optimal cavity shape, tube bundle arrangement, tube numbers, cavity mounting height and insulation thickness are considered, while for the mirror field, the number of mirrors, mirror width, mirror gaps and mirror focal length are considered to achieve the optimisation goals. A multi-stage optimisation process is followed. Firstly, optical (using SolTrace), thermal (using a view area approach) and economic performance are combined in a multi-objective genetic algorithm as incorporated in ANSYS DesignXplorer (DX). This leads to an optimal LFC with a variable focal length for each mirror. After determining a <b>fixed</b> optimal <b>focal</b> length for all the mirrors, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach is used to optimise the thermal insulation of the cavity receiver for minimal heat loss and minimal insulation material. The process is automated through the use of ANSYS Workbench and Excel (coding with Visual Basic for Application (VBA) and LK Scripting in SolTrace). The view area approach provides an inexpensive way of calculating radiation heat loss from the receiver that is shown in the subsequent CFD analysis to be dominating the heat transfer loss mechanisms. The optimised receiver is evaluated at different LFC plant tube temperatures to assess its performance.
