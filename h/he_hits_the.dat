25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move in and out of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E
500|$|Burnett {{left after}} seven innings and was {{replaced}} by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies put two runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base, the second close call made by the first base umpire Brian Gorman. Gorman himself later admitted he missed this call, saying [...] "on a freeze frame, it looks like there's {{a little bit of a}} ball outside his glove when <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> bag." [...] Ultimately, Rivera threw 39 pitches and got six outs for his 38th postseason save, his tenth in World Series play.|$|E

500|$|Dale Cooper {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from Hawk (Michael Horse) about a one-armed man seen at Ronette Pulaski's hospital bed. The next morning, Cooper gathers together Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputies Hawk and Brennan (Harry Goaz), and Lucy Moran (Kimmy Robertson) in a forest clearing to demonstrate his unusual approach to eliminating suspects from their investigation. As each suspect's name is read from a list, Cooper throws a stone at a bottle placed [...] away. Each time <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> bottle with a stone, he considers the previous name read out to be of interest to the case. The method points his suspicion at Leo Johnson and psychiatrist Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn). Dale's fellow FBI agent Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) arrives later, while Truman and Cooper review evidence, and immediately causes friction between himself and Truman.|$|E
500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. You feel when he is inside the box <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> target." [...] Away to Southampton, {{it was the other}} signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for me. I have missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and my confidence was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} European {{version of}} the music video for [...] "Trouble" [...] was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video footage was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. A Wild West-themed video, it features Martin as a prisoner in a dark warehouse, tied with ropes to a chair, being circled by cars in the freezing cold. The {{other members of the}} band are seen on the upper floor in a slow motion sequence where Buckland and Champion struggle with bass guitarist Guy Berryman, tying him to another chair and forcing him to look in front. At this point, Martin's struggling causes his chair to tip over, and <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ground on his side. He sings the final line of the song ("They spun a web for me..."), before the darkness abruptly turns to daylight. [...] A beautiful sunrise is then revealed, but as the camera pans out, it is revealed to be fake and part of a large theater backdrop, with Martin still lying on his side, tied to the chair.|$|E

500|$|At {{the scene}} of the crime, the pair deduce Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the {{microwave}} not suitable for those with a pacemaker, and read at the magazine rack. They go to Sideshow Bob with the intention of finding if Krusty had any enemies, but are given tickets to his show. At the live broadcast, Bart is invited up on stage with Sideshow Bob, where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine, which Sideshow Bob dismisses. When Sideshow Bob says he has [...] "a lot of big shoes to fill", Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber's foot, causing him to scream in pain. Bart realizes that despite wearing clown shoes all the time, Krusty never would have felt Homer stepping on them due to his small feet. Bart then deduces that Sideshow Bob is the real robber, since he had the most to gain through Krusty's downfall and has large feet. To prove his theory, <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public. The police, having watched the show, realize they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and head down to the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter and Chris set up traps {{for each}} other as they fight. Lois then gets sick of the boys fighting, so the monkey tricks Peter and Chris into coming to dinner together. Chris and Peter admit they don't hate each other and vow to spend more time together. As they are doing this, they see Brian and Stewie running away from the chaotic Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and {{attempts}} to talk her out of her rampage (as well as her career), but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him {{to the top of a}} nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts escalating. The monkey falls out of her hands and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley's skin, hair and clothes peel off, revealing her android skeleton and she tries to kill Peter and Quagmire with a rock, but fails. Eventually, she is pummelled off the top. Afterwards, the monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> road far below. Stewie and Brian then see the broken Miley, where Stewie says Brian can now have sex with her, but Miley blows up seconds later. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian wags his tails in excitement and tells Stewie that it's not too late to have sex with her, anticipating what's to happen with him next with her hand. Monkey then moves out of Chris's closet, and his friendly attitude also parts ways with him, saying he will [...] "go where he's needed", and moves to Tom Tucker's upside-down-faced son Jake's closet as his new haunt.|$|E

500|$|An {{aggressive}} right-handed all-rounder, Loxton {{tended to}} bat in the middle-order, and bowled {{after the new}} ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known {{for his ability to}} move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, {{to the extent that the}} Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip [...] "That's what I call using the crease". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian [...] "really used to give everything he had all the time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt." [...] Bradman said that Loxton [...] "never shirked the issue" [...] and that [...] "he’d throw himself into it with everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. You could call on him at any stage and he’d give you his very best." [...] Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder [...] "was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort". He further added that the Victorian was [...] "the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ball it is the music of a sledgehammer." [...] Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder’s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.|$|E

2500|$|A skilled batsman {{can use a}} {{wide array}} of [...] "shots" [...] or [...] "strokes" [...] in both {{defensive}} and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an [...] "edge". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply [...] "blocking" [...] the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., [...] "cut", [...] "drive", [...] "hook", [...] "pull".|$|E

2500|$|On July 29, 2007, Ichiro {{collected}} his 1,500th U.S. hit, {{the third}} fastest {{to reach the}} MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, {{more than any other}} batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, [...] "I wish you could put a camera at third base to see how <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ball and see the way it deceives you.
