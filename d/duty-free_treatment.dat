50|$|Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 (CBERA) — P.L. 98-67 (August 5, 1983), Title II, {{authorized}} unilateral {{preferential trade}} and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> of eligible products. Often {{referred to as}} the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Amended several times, the last substantive revisions were made in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382, Title II, August 20, 1990). This made trade benefits permanent (repealing the September 30, 1995 termination date). The law gives preferential trade and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free entry of eligible products. To be eligible, an article must be a product of a beneficiary country and imported directly from it, and at least 35% of its import value must have originated in one or more CBERA beneficiaries. Slightly different import value rules apply to articles entering from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The duty-free import of sugar and beef products is subject to a special eligibility requirement intended to ensure that increased production of sugar and beef will not adversely affect overall food production. Preferential tariff treatment does not extend to imports of: textiles and apparel subject to textile agreements, specified footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and its products, and watches or watch parts containing any material originating in countries denied normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) trade status. Special criteria applied to the duty-free import of ethanol through FY2000. Import-sensitive products, not accorded duty-free tariff treatment, are eligible to enter at lower than normal trade relations tariff rates. These products include handbags, luggage, flat goods (such as wallets, change purses, and key and eyeglass cases), work gloves, and certain leather wearing apparel.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "U. S. asparagus imports increased in the 1990 s and now comprise nearly one-half of the asparagus consumed in the United States. Peru is the second largest source of imported asparagus and benefits from <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). ATPA is estimated to have displaced between two and eight percent {{of the value of}} domestic production from what it would have been without the act. Although the supply of fresh asparagus from imports has increased since ATPA's enactment, consumer demand has been strong, and prices have risen. In addition, an apparent increase in consumer preference for fresh asparagus has contributed to a downward shift in the domestic demand for processed asparagus. Most of the decline in the domestic production of processed asparagus occurred in Michigan and Washington, the two states that produce most canned and frozen asparagus. If ATPA is reauthorized, domestic producers of asparagus and, in particular, asparagus for processing, will likely face continued displacement, but consumers can expect continued benefits from the year-round availability of fresh asparagus. However, some of this displacement will likely occur even if ATPA is not reauthorized and the normal tariff is imposed. If ATPA is not reauthorized, consumers would likely have decreased availability and pay higher prices to the extent that tariff increases reduce Peruvian asparagus imports and hence total asparagus supplies. Domestic industries can petition the U. S. International Trade Commission to investigate whether increased imports under the ATPA have caused them serious injury or threat of serious injury. If the Commission finds serious injury, it may recommend relief options to the President, including suspending <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> for imports. ...|$|E

In any customs union or free trade agreement, one of the critical issues concerns "rules of origin.

The criterion for <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> is important in determining the economic effects of the rule of origin. It is shown that rules of origin in fact extend the protection accorded by each country to producers in other free trade agreement member countries. As such, rules of origin can constitute a source of bias toward economic inefficiency in free trade agreements in a way they cannot do with customs unions. ...|$|E

For Japan, once the TPP agreement is implemented, over 50 percent of U. S. farm product exports (by value) will receive <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> immediately.

40|$|Some {{developing}} countries may experience important trade losses if tariffs are liberalized on a general most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. Sub-Saharan Africa {{appears to be}} especially vulnerable to this problem. African countries receive important Lome Convention preferences in the European Economic Community (EEC), under which <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment,</b> or tariffs below MFN and generalized system of preferences (GSP) rates, are applied to their exports. Other OECD countries normally apply GSP duties, or even more advantageous"least developed"country preferences to African exports. The proposed Uruguay Round reductions in MFN tariffs will erode those tariff preference margins and cause some African exports to be displaced by other suppliers. The author documents the importance of African countries of existing OECD preference, particularly those of the EEC. More than 95 percent of all African-tariff-line products shipped to the EEC receive <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment,</b> while other exporters of the same products face tariffs as much as 20 percentage points higher. Similar favorable terms of preferential access also exist in Japan and the United States, although the preference margins are smaller than in the EEC. Using a trade projection model developed by the World Bank and the UNCTAD, the author estimates that eliminating EEC, Japanese, and U. S. MFN tariffs would cause African export losses of about $ 4 billion (estimated present value). The countries {{that seem to be}} most vulnerable to these adverse trade effects are Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. What about the possibility that the losses African countries could experience from erosion of tariff preferences could be offset by the liberalization of nontariff measures? The author discounts this likelihood. In general, few important OECD nontariff measures are applied to African products [...] most African textile and clothing exports are even excluded from Multifibre Arrangement restrictions. And those that are applied (such as eco-labeling or licensing requirements) do not restrict trade very much. The author's observations accent the need for action to offset the impact of Africa's loss of preferences {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round. What offsetting actions are possible and appropriate? Aggressive reform of the African countries'own trade regimes appears to be the most effective way to counter the effects of the erosion of OECD preferences.

40|$|The Doha Ministerial Declaration {{emphasized}} that priority {{should be given}} to improving market access for products originating in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). In this paper, we analyze the importance of this proposition with respect to market access in the Triad economies. We first present a brief history of non-reciprocal preferences granted by the Triad. This covers Generalized System of Preference (GSP) programmes in each, and further preferences granted to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries by the EU and preferences granted to Caribbean Basin, Andean, and African countries by the US. This history is followed by an assessment of trade generated by these preferences in the year 2000, and {{of the extent to which}} LDC exports might be expected to increase should the preferences be made comprehensive.

40|$|Excerpt] During 2001, $ 1. 7 {{billion in}} U. S. imports {{from the four}} Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) {{beneficiary}} countries entered the United States duty-free under provisions in the ATPA; however, {{a significant portion of}} these duty-free entries (36 percent or $ 589 million) probably would have qualified for duty-free entry under other existing U. S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences. Thus, approximately 64 percent ($ 1. 1 billion) of these duty-free entries represent the unique benefits of the ATPA to the ATPA-beneficiary nations. These unique ATPA benefits represented 11. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from the ATPA beneficiary nations and 0. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from all nations in 2001. Over 94 percent of the items eligible for ATPA <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> actually entered duty-free. The main finding of this report is: Preferential tariff treatment under the ATPA {{does not appear to have}} had an adverse impact on, or have constituted a significant threat to, U. S. employment.

The WTO-GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) has all but won the war against tariffs. Tariffs on imports of OECD-manufactured goods—which {{account for more than}} two-thirds of world merchandise trade—are to average only 3. 8 percent when the Uruguay Round cuts are fully implemented, with <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> applying to fully two-fifths of these trade flows. As in all wars, victory is never total. Tariffs on rich nations ’ food and clothing imports and poor nations ’ industrial imports are still high, as table 1 shows, but these items account for little of world trade. Moreover, the industrial tariffs of poor nations, at least, seem to be falling of their own accord. Trade is nonetheless far from unfettered. “Regulatory protection ” is but one name for {{the tens of thousands of}} cost-raising, behind-the-border measures that continue to substantially inhibit trade.

The planned abolition of the quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in 2005 will alter the competitiveness of various exporting countries. Bangladesh relies heavily on textile and clothing exports and is potentially very vulnerable to this change in competitiveness.

The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment.

This paper uses a CGE model to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} SADC FTA on Madagascar economy. The results suggest that the SADC FTA would only have a limited impact on Madagascar''s real GDP because the liberalization affects only a small share of its total imports. However, Madagascar''s trade and production pattern would change and benefit the textile and clothing sector. Removing rigidities in the labor and capital market would increase the gains but they would remain limited.

As {{a member of}} the CEMAC, Congo''s tariff scheme at least formally is guided by CEMAC''s 1994 trade regime agreement. This paper shows CEMAC''s customs code is restrictive relative to that of comparable regional integration groups. The paper also discusses a number of quantitative and qualitative barriers to trade applied by Congo that render its current regime complex, nontransparent, and relatively unpredictable, compromising efforts to develop the non-oil sector and the country''s export base. Moreover, Congo''s high tariffs and other taxes have not led to higher fiscal revenues, as the number of exemptions granted in recent years has surged and customs administration remains weak.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{submission}} {{of this report}} to the Congress continues {{a series of reports}} by the U. S. Department of Labor on the impact o f the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) on U. S. employment. The current report covers calendar year 2003 and represents the eleventh in the series. The ATPA, enacted on December 4, 1991, authorized the President to proclaim <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> for eligible articles from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, The ATPA expired on December 4, 2001, but was subsequently expanded in product coverage and renewed to December 31, 2006 by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) that was signed into law by the President on August 6, 2002. Section 207 of the ATPA directs the Secretary of Labor to undertake a continuing review and analysis {{of the impact of the}} agreement on U. S. employment and submit a summary report of such analysis annually to the Congress. During 2003, $ 1. 6 billion in U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries entered the United States duty-free under provisions in the ATPA; however, a significant portion of these duty-free entries (about 40 percent) probably would have qualified for duty-free entry under other existing U. S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences. In addition, $ 4. 2 billion in U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries benefited exclusively from the ATPDEA and entered the United States duty-free under its provisions for expanded product coverage. ATPA duty-free benefits in 2003 represented 14 percent of total U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries and only 0. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from all nations. ATPDEA duty-free benefits in 2003 accounted for 36 percent of total U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries, but only 0. 3 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. Overall, U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries that benefited exclusively from the ATPA (on eligible products not eligible for GSP) and the ATPDEA (all covered products) amounted to $ 5. 2 billion in 2003, which represented about 45 percent of all U. S. imports from the beneficiary countries, but just 0. 4 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. The main finding of this report is that preferential tariff treatment under the ATPA/ATPDEA has neither had an adverse impact on nor posed a significant threat to U. S. employment...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States has historically provided assistance to support development in Haiti. Over the last several years, Congress has attempted to promote Haiti's economic development {{through the use of}} trade preferences for Haitian products. In 2000, Congress extended preferences under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to allow for <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> of apparel through the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). In 2006, Congress passed the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, giving preferential access to U. S. imports of Haitian apparel. In 2008, Congress amended HOPE (now known as HOPE II), expanding trade preference provisions already in place and creating new ones to further support the growth of the apparel industry in Haiti. It was the intent of Congress that HOPE II would help Haiti attract new investment and create jobs while simultaneously providing incentives to encourage the use of inputs manufactured by U. S. companies. Most recently, in an effort to support Haiti's recovery from the devastating earthquake that hit the country in January 2010, Congress passed the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act of 2010, expanding and modifying several trade preference provisions under HOPE II. The various provisions included under HOPE II and CBTPA offer different avenues through which qualifying apparel goods produced in Haiti can be exported to the United States duty-free. One trade preference provision originally created under HOPE II was the " 3 -for- 1 " Earned Import Allowance Program (EIAP). The provision under Hope II established that for every 3 -square-meter equivalent (SME) of qualifying fabric a firm imports to Haiti, the firm would be allowed to earn a credit to export 1 SME of apparel produced in Haiti to the United States, duty-free, regardless of the source of the fabric. In this way, EIAP was designed to both aid Haiti's apparel industry and encourage the use of U. S. -manufactured inputs. The HELP Act reduced the EIAP exchange ratio from 3 -for- 1 to 2 -for- 1. The change sought to encourage the use of EIAP, since no apparel from Haiti was exported to the United States under the original 3 -for- 1 model. This report responds to a mandate in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which requires GAO to review EIAP annually and conduct an evaluation of the program. We issued our first report under this mandate in June 2010, focusing on EIAP as it existed during the period of our first review, from October 2009 to June 2010, at which time it featured the 3 -for- 1 exchange ratio. That report also included a more complete discussion of HOPE II and CBTPA preference provisions. In this report, we assess the extent to which EIAP has been used since it was amended under the HELP Act [...] signed into law on May 24, 2010. ...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{proposed}} U. S. -Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, {{also called}} the U. S. -Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), was signed by the United States and Colombia on November 22, 2006. The agreement {{must be approved by}} Congress before it can enter into force. Upon congressional approval, it would immediately eliminate duties on 80 % of U. S. exports of consumer and industrial products to Colombia. An additional 7 % of U. S. exports would receive <b>duty-free</b> <b>treatment</b> within five years of implementation, and most remaining tariffs would be eliminated within 10 years of implementation. The agreement also contains other provisions in services, investment, intellectual property rights protection, labor, and the environment. About 90 % of U. S. imports from Colombia enter the United States duty-free under trade preference programs or through normal trade relations, while U. S. exports to Colombia face duties of up to 20 %. It is possible that the 112 th may consider implementing legislation for the proposed CFTA. Negotiations for the agreement were conducted under the trade promotion authority (TPA), also called fast-track trade authority, that Congress granted the President under the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Act of 2002 (P. L. 107 - 210). The authority allowed the President to enter into trade agreements that would receive expedited congressional consideration (no amendments and limited debate). Implementing legislation for the CFTA (H. R. 5724 /S. 2830) was introduced in the 110 th Congress on April 8, 2008, under TPA. The House leadership, however, took the position that the President had submitted the implementing legislation without adequately fulfilling the TPA requirement for consultation with Congress. On April 10, 2008, the House voted 224 - 195 to make the provisions establishing expedited procedures, inapplicable to the CFTA implementing legislation (H. Res. 1092). In his January 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama mentioned the importance of opening foreign markets for U. S. goods and services, and strengthening U. S. trade relations with Colombia. In 2010, the Administration initiated a new National Export Initiative (NEI), which includes a component that calls for opening new markets for U. S. exports by resolving outstanding issues on the pending CFTA. The Obama Administration also has made a case for pursuing free trade agreements as part of the National Security Strategy of the United States, though the CFTA is not specifically mentioned in the report. The congressional debate surrounding the agreement has mostly centered on the violence issues in Colombia. Some members of Congress oppose the agreement because of concerns about violence against union members and other terrorist activity in Colombia. However, numerous members of Congress support the CFTA and take issue with these charges, stating that Colombia has made progress in recent years to curb the violence in the country. They also contend that the agreement would open the Colombian market for U. S. exporters. Other policymakers argue that Colombia is a crucial ally of the United States in Latin America and that if the trade agreement is not passed, it may lead to further violence in the region. For Colombia, a free trade agreement with the United States is part of its overall economic development strategy. The United States is Colombia’s leading trade partner. Colombia accounts for {{a very small percentage of}} U. S. trade (0. 8 % in 2009), ranking 22 nd among U. S. export markets and 27 th as a source of U. S. imports. Economic studies on the impact of a U. S. -Colombia free trade agreement (FTA) have found that, upon full implementation of an agreement, the impact on the United States would be positive but very small due to the small size of the Colombian economy when compared to that of the United States (about 1. 6 %) ...|$|E
