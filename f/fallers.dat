25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the <b>fallers,</b> which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are <b>fallers</b> or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the <b>fallers</b> of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the <b>fallers</b> which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} trousers, type A and type C. Type A protects only {{the front of}} the legs, and can be supplied as chaps, worn over conventional work clothes, or as conventional trousers. Type C gives protection all around the legs and are almost always worn as ordinary trousers, not over another garment. Chaps are generally used for occasional, farm or homeowner applications. Professional chainsaw operators would choose trousers for comfort and ease of movement, with <b>fallers,</b> ground workers and firewood cutters opting for class A trousers because of the low risk of being cut {{in the back of the}} leg. Climbers and tree surgeons would have to wear type C, as they will be cutting from a wider variety of positions. Type C trousers are, of course, highly insulating, and may lead to heat stress if worn for labour-intensive operations such as firewood cutting.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-five people aged 65 and over who {{reported}} to their doctors {{that they had}} suffered falls at home were seen shortly after the fall by a research nurse who obtained a detailed history, based {{as far as possible}} on the patient's own statements and on an attempted reconstruc-tion of the fall. Analysis of this description led to a classification of falls based {{on the nature of the}} displacing force. In turn, this classification can be used to highlight the necessary preventive action. FALLS in old people at home are common and disabling (Sheldon, 1948; Droller, 1955). Knowledge of how they occur is necessary for their prevention. Few studies have described in detail what actually happened when the old person fell. This is because of the observer's difficulty in reaching the patient soon after the fall, and the <b>faller's</b> difficulty in recalling and expressing what happened. The study by Gray (1966) of home accidents in the elderly broke new ground in both respects; but mainly emphasized environmental hazards. In the present study old people who had fallen at home were seen at the place of the fall by a research nurse within a few days of falling. Information was obtained on factors relating to the fall. Analysis of the data yields a new formulation of the cause of falls, which in turn facilitates prevention...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a tool, based on the {{knowledge}} of technical errors, which helps to improve the teaching and learning process of the Uki Goshi technique. With this aim, we set out to determine the most frequent errors made by 44 students when performing this technique and how these mistakes relate. In order to do so, an observational analysis was carried out using the OSJUDO-UKG instrument and the data were registered using Match Vision Studio (Castellano, Perea, Alday and Hernández, 2008). The results, analyzed through descriptive statistics, show that the absence of a correct initial unbalancing movement (45, 5 %), the lack of proper right-arm pull (56, 8 %), not blocking the <b>faller's</b> body (Uke) against the thrower's hip -Tori- (54, 5 %) and throwing the Uke through the Tori's side are the most usual mistakes (72, 7 %). Through the sequencial analysis of T-Patterns obtained with the THÈME program (Magnusson, 1996, 2000) we have concluded that not blocking the body with the Tori's hip provokes the Uke's throw through the Tori's side during the final phase of the technique (95, 8 %), and positioning the right arm on the dorsal region of the Uke's back during the Tsukuri entails the absence of a subsequent pull of the Uke's body (73, 3 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|Variations of the Parallel Walk Test, {{referred}} to as Narrow Path Walking Test, {{have been used for}} identification of elderly <b>fallers,</b> and assessing balance in people with MS. Gimmons et.al used 50% of the distance between the subject’s ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) plus the width of the subject’s shoe to normalize the challenge to different body morphologies. They used 3 trials and averaged the time and score. They also had the subjects perform the Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment, POMA and fill out a questionnaire regarding fear of falling, FES-1. They found a significant difference in time between <b>fallers</b> and non-fallers F=11.498, P<0.001, when age, gender, and fear of falling were adjusted. Overall, they found Narrow Path Walking Test was better able to identify <b>fallers</b> than the POMA and FES-1.|$|E
