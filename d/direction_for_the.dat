5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E

5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{proclamation}} {{had been}} issued ordering the Army Reserve {{to be called}} out for permanent service, the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to embody {{all or part of}} the Territorial Force. If no such order was forthcoming, however, then unless Parliament directed otherwise the Army Council was to issue a <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embodiment of the entire Force. If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the proclamation, it was to resume its session within ten days. The Crown was able to issue a proclamation disembodying the whole Force, and until such proclamation was issued the Army Council was permitted to embody or disembody such elements of the Force as they saw fit.|$|E
5|$|Rebel Heart is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} March 6, 2015, by Interscope Records. Following {{the completion of the}} MDNA release and promotion, Madonna worked on the album throughout 2014, co-writing and co-producing it with various musicians, including Diplo, Avicii, and Kanye West. She regularly uploaded pictures of her recording sessions on her Instagram account. Unlike her previous efforts, which involved only a few people, working with a large number of collaborators posed problems for Madonna in keeping a cohesive sound and creative <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album.|$|E

5|$|The UK edition {{contained}} Bob Cato's colour {{photo of}} Harrison {{sitting in front}} of an antique car, with art <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> package being credited to Cream designs. The international CD release of the album uses the latter cover. The inner sleeve of the original LP in Britain contained a picture by Michael Putland, showing Harrison on a wintry beach in Cannes, where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976. A third front-cover option came with MFP's budget reissue during the 1980s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 White Album portrait.|$|E
5|$|The art <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1988 {{release was}} instead {{put in the}} hands of CBS Records' art {{director}} Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico. This was an abnormally late start to an Atlantic hurricane season: only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11. The storm moved slowly in a generally westward <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next few days, peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It then weakened until it made landfall along the northern Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur as a tropical depression, where it caused only minor damage. Near 0600 UTC on September 16, the storm deteriorated into a depression, and dissipated a few hours later.|$|E

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nation also diminished the {{long-term}} prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nation also {{threatened}} the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. PedroII, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and PedroII himself believed that {{the death of his}} two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.|$|E
5|$|Their early albums Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change... show {{a groove}} metal and thrash metal approach, similar to bands like Pantera and Exhorder. The albums also {{featured}} technical drumming by Chris Kontos and Dave McClain. The band changed their musical <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> albums The Burning Red (1999) and Supercharger (2001), {{which have been}} described as displaying a nu metal sound. These albums featured rapping by Robb Flynn and simpler guitar riffs, but retaining part of their aggressive sound. This change in direction resulted in criticism from many fans because of the popularity of nu metal at the time.|$|E

5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again {{for more than a}} quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they help make the first impression on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} sold the most tickets of any {{film in the}} {{franchise}} until 2009's Star Trek, and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation, but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared to expectations and marketing. The Motion Pictures budget of $46million, including costs incurred during PhaseII production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. David Gerrold estimated before its release that the film would have to gross {{two to three times}} its budget to be profitable for Paramount. The studio faulted Roddenberry's script rewrites and creative <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> plodding pace and disappointing gross. While the performance of The Motion Picture convinced the studio to back a (cheaper) sequel, Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control. Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer would produce and direct , which received better reviews (becoming a fan favorite) and continued the franchise. With the successful revival of the Star Trek brand on the big screen setting an example, Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping the clocks in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline for the end of the session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} constructed {{between the}} Meadowbrook and Northern state parkways in 1956 was undergoing a new $61 million (1989USD) reconstruction {{project in the}} late 1980s. Although it was previously redesigned in 1968, it was still the site of about 180 accidents per year—over six times the statewide average for accident frequency. The junction was to be rebuilt with three lanes in each <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Northern State {{in the middle of}} exit31A, a direct ramp between the westbound Northern State Parkway and the southbound Meadowbrook, connections from Glen Cove Road to both parkways, and the relocation of exit and entrance ramps within the interchange. Construction began in May1988, and the project was expected to be completed on October31, 1991. It was proceeding on schedule until the village of Westbury filed a suit against NYSDOT in February1989. The lawsuit claimed that NYSDOT did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing the project because their environmental impact report failed to consider the impacts of a nearby future widening project on the Northern State Parkway. This widening project, considered a second phase of the interchange reconstruction, had no intended date of construction.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E
