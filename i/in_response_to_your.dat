However, {{in the absence of}} any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, [...] "like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets," [...] he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, [...] "this is really all I can say <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> question, I think you know what I mean."

6000|$|I get, habitually, the {{sympathetic}} infection, from Colvin, {{of so much}} general uneasiness and even alarm about you, that it is reassuring to find you apparently incommoded by nothing worse than the privation of liquor and tobacco. [...] "Nothing worse?" [...] I hear you echo, while you ask to what more refined savagery of torture I can imagine you subjected. You would rather perhaps--and small blame to you--perish by the sword than by famine. But you won't perish, my dear Louis, and I am {{here to tell you}} so. I should have perished--long ago--if it were mortal. No liquor--to speak of--passes my wasted lips, and yet they are capable of the hypocrisy of the sigh of resignation. I am very, very sorry for you--for I remember the genial tray which in the far-off, fabulous time used to be placed, as the evening waxed, under the social lamp at Skerryvore. The evenings wax at Vailima, but the tray, I gather, has waned. May this heavy trial be lightened, and, as you missionaries say, be even blessed to you. It wounds, I repeat, but it doesn't kill--more's the pity. The tobacco's another question. I have smoked a cigarette--at Skerryvore; and I shall probably smoke one again. But I don't look forward to it. However, you will think me objectionably destitute of temperament. What depresses me much more is the sad sense that you receive scarcely anything I send you. This, however, doesn't deter me from posting you to-day, registered, via San Francisco (it is post-day,) a volume of thin trifles lately put forth by me and entitled Essays in London and Elsewhere. It contains some pretty writing--not addressed to the fishes. My last letter to you, to which yours of June 17th [was a reply]--the only dated one, dear Louis, I ever got from you!--was intended to accompany two other volumes of mine, which were despatched to you, registered, via San F., at the same moment (The Real Thing and The Private Life.) Yet neither of these works, evidently, had reached you when you ask me not to send you the former (though my letter mentioned that it had started,) as you had ordered it. It is all a mystery which the fishes only will have sounded. I also post to you herewith Paul Bourget's last little tale (Un Scruple,) as to which nothing will induce me to utter the faintest rudiments of an opinion. It is full of talent (I don't call that a rudiment,) but the French are passing strange. I am very glad to be able to send you herewith enclosed a petit mot from the said Paul Bourget, <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> sense of outrage at his too-continuous silence.... His intentions, I can answer for it, had been the best; but he leads so migratory a life that I don't see how any intention can ever well fructify. He has spent the winter in the Holy Land and jumps thence in three weeks (from Beyrout) to his queer American expedition. A year ago--more--he earnestly asked me (at Siena) for your address. I as eagerly gave it to him--par écrit--but the acknowledgment that he was then full of the desire to make to you succumbed to complex frustrations. Now that, at last, here it is, I wish you {{to be able to read}} it! But you won't. My hand is the hand of Apollo to it.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Combating {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD) and their means of delivery {{is one of the greatest}} challenges the United States faces. Traditionally, the use of WMD [...] which include chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons [...] has been constrained by the logic of deterrence and of diplomacy, but these constraints may be of less utility in preventing the use of WMD by rogue states or terrorist groups. The Department of Defense (DOD) assigns top priority to dissuading, deterring, and defeating those who seek to harm the United States directly, especially extremist enemies with WMD. In 1994, Congress established an interagency committee, now known as the Counterproliferation Program Review Committee (CPRC), with a variety of duties related to coordinating the activities and programs of federal agencies that address improvements in the U. S. government's efforts to combat WMD. The Secretary of Defense, as chairman of the CPRC, is required to report its findings biennially. The Departments of Energy, State, and Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are also members of the CPRC, and must provide it with access to information on all pertinent programs, projects, and activities. The Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Programs, as chairman of the CPRC Standing Committee, compiles the report of the CPRC and submits it to Congress biennially. GAO has reported extensively in recent years on nonproliferation and consequence management - two of the three pillars of combating WMD. Our most recent report on the third pillar, counterproliferation, was issued in 2000. DOD defines counterproliferation as "those actions taken to defeat the threat and/or use of WMD against the United States, our military forces, friends, and allies. " House Armed Services Committee Report 111 - 166 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, directed GAO to assess and report on DOD and interagency counterproliferation activities, including the extent to which (1) existing strategies for the combating WMD mission are effective and the strategic framework encompasses a common lexicon, (2) DOD has developed comprehensive plans that are integrated across combating WMD mission areas, and (3) counterproliferation programs and related funding support DOD plans and strategies. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> discussions with <b>your</b> staff, this report focuses on the extent to which DOD counterproliferation programs and related funding support DOD plans and strategies. 7 You asked us to focus on the third objective at this time, to inform Congress as it deliberates on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.

[...] He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, and religion. [...] Moore maintains that {{there are at least three}} other problems with the [...] "nothing to hide" [...] argument. First, if individuals have privacy rights, then invoking [...] "nothing to hide" [...] is irrelevant. Privacy, understood as a right to control access to and uses of spaces, locations, and personal information, means that it is the right holder who determines access. To drive this point home Moore offers the following case. [...] "Imagine upon exiting your house one day you find a person searching through your trash painstakingly putting the shredded notes and documents back together. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> stunned silence he proclaims 'you don’t have anything to worry about - there is no reason to hide, is there?'" [...] Second, individuals may wish to hide embarrassing behavior or conduct not accepted by the dominant culture. [...] "Consider someone’s sexual or medical history. Imagine someone visiting a library to learn about alternative lifestyles not accepted by the majority." [...] Finally, Moore argues that [...] "nothing to hide," [...] if taken seriously, could be used against government agents, politicians, and CEO's. This is to turn the “nothing to hide” argument on its head. Moore argues that the NSA agent, politician, police chief, and CEO have nothing to hide so they should embrace total transparency like the rest of us. [...] "But they don’t and when given the technological tools to watch, the politician, police chief, or CEO are almost always convinced that watching others is a good thing." ...|$|E
