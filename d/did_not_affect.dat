5|$|Hurricane Able <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> land significantly.

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that whether type A children elements have references or <b>not,</b> it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> the type of validation to be made, since an edition on an element of this type <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> any reference in the document, only its subtree structure.

30|$|First, {{there is}} a set of {{variables}} that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> efficiency scores in any estimation. First, school location <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to <b>affect</b> the efficiency (RURAL and CITY). On average, schools in rural areas or small villages have worse educational outcomes than those located in bigger cities. The fact that the town size <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> significantly the efficiency implies that the higher results are due to a greater allocation of educational resources and not to a better use of them. Likewise, the teacher–student ratio (TEACHSTU) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> either school’s efficiency.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} three {{different}} European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged.

Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} prompted {{standard precautions}} in the Bahamas and Florida, although it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> the region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced winds up to 55mph (90km/h) and high waves, and across New England {{there were nine}} traffic fatalities. The hurricane killed 2people in Canada and caused over $1million in damage.|$|E

Its cast included William Faversham as Algy, Henry Miller as Jack, Viola Allen as Gwendolen, and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell. The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented by Dion Boucicault, Jr. and Robert Brough, and the play was an immediate success.

5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

5|$|During this season, 14tropical {{depressions}} formed {{of which}} seven attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally {{classified as a}} tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Three tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which only one became a major hurricane, which is a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Emily was the costliest storm of the season, causing $80.3million in damage (1987USD) as it ravaged the Dominican Republic and Bermuda. Tropical Depression Fourteen was the deadliest storm of the season, causing six deaths as it passed across Jamaica. Of the seven cyclones that attained tropical storm status, three <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Maria was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} which {{formed in}} September2005 during the annual hurricane season. Maria was the thirteenth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the record-breaking season. Hurricane Maria {{formed in the}} central Atlantic on September 1 and tracked to the northwest, strengthening as it moved over warm waters. The storm reached its peak strength on September 5 east of Bermuda and gradually weakened before becoming extratropical on September 10. Hurricane Maria <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> any land as a tropical system, but it brought tropical storm-force winds to Iceland as an extratropical cyclone and produced heavy rain and three fatalities in Norway.|$|E
