60|$|Dame Dermody {{was sitting}} {{in the light of the}} window, as usual, with one of the mystic books of Emanuel Swedenborg open on her lap. She solemnly lifted her hand on our appearance, signing to us to occupy our {{customary}} corner without speaking to her. It was an act of domestic high treason to interrupt the Sibyl at her books. We crept quietly into our places. Mary waited until she saw her grandmother's gray <b>head</b> <b>bend</b> down, and her grandmother's bushy eyebrows contract attentively, over her reading. Then, and then only, the discreet child rose on tiptoe, disappeared noiselessly in the direction of her bedchamber, and came back to me carrying something carefully wrapped up in her best cambric handkerchief.|$|E

He fell to my rifle, and is now being devoured by {{ourselves}} and our dogs with great relish. He is about the size of a very small cow; has a large head and enormously thick horns, which cover the whole top of his <b>head,</b> <b>bend</b> down toward his cheeks, and then curve up and outward at the point. He is covered with long, brown hair, which almost reaches the ground, and has no tail worthy of the name. He seems to be an active and an angry creature. When I wounded him he came at me furiously, but had not pluck to charge home. As he turned away I gave him the shot that killed him. The meat is not bad, but it smells strongly of musk. Walrus is better.|$|E

A 2 D FEM coupled thermal-stress analysis was employed to simulate the rolling process. The effects o f the temperature difference, friction coefficient, reduction and the rolling speed on the <b>head</b> <b>bending</b> are discussed in the paper. Simulation results are in agreement with the measured values. Key words: <b>head</b> <b>bending,</b> narrow strip, FEM simulation...|$|R

5000|$|When {{studying}} the eventual appearance of [...] "Modulus", Isao Hosoe began {{by looking at}} the robots of the past. These included [...] "Electro", built by Westinghouse in 1939. Hosoe hit on the right appearance by studying human expressions and gestures, bearing in mind that a domestic robot needs to be appealing on account of its proximity to man. Its eyelids have to open, its pupils dilate or contract. It must be able to nod or shake its <b>head,</b> <b>bend</b> its torso, and raise, lower and rotate its arms. [...] "Modulus", however, has no feet. Available in three configurations - [...] "Base", [...] "Service & Security" [...] and [...] "Moddy" [...] - [...] "Modulus" [...] stands on a Base unit 35 cm in diameter and 15 cm high, two two-speed motors connected to rubber wheels, and two spherical stabilizers. It comes with a small infra-red Instrument for connecting it to another remote control device or for interacting with the major home and personal computers.|$|E

5000|$|Enhanced {{physical}} strength far above {{that of a}} human and even most super-humans, making him [...] "more powerful than a locomotive," [...] is one of Superman's signature powers and has often been described as chief among his other abilities. Depictions of the upper limit of how much weight he can lift have ranged {{from being able to}} do the work of several laborers in half the time, crush diamonds in his grasp, lift objects hundreds of times his own weight including any sized vehicle over his <b>head,</b> <b>bend</b> steel with his bare hands, lifting mountains, and {{all the way up to}} in the Silver Age and Modern Age where he is seen moving entire planets. This makes him one of the strongest beings in the DC Universe. After being saturated with yellow solar energy in All-Star Superman, his strength was tested, and demonstrated to be sufficient to support over 200 quintillion tons (or 2x1020 tons in scientific notation, i.e., two hundred billion billion tons); he held this much with one hand and he even said he feels like he can pick up more, enough to pull Earth away from the sun. As of The New 52 reboot, his strength now exceeds 5.972 sextillion metric tons, and he managed to do it in the absence of a sun for five consecutive days with only a single drop of sweat, leaving Superman asking for more, although this has been done before by the New Earth/Infinite Crisis Superman, when he moved the Earth away from the Sun against Starbreaker's force. On this occasion, he did have the assistance of the Green Lantern, however, it should be noted that Green Lantern only made a chain out of willpower and connected it to Earth, with Superman alone providing the actual pulling strength. It should also be noted that Superman from the Post-Crisis era can lift even heavier items like Mageddon (a mechanism that dwarfs the Sun) and the Book of Infinite Pages with the assistance of Shazam. Explanations include being adapted to the heavier gravity of Krypton, and his muscles using the power of the solar energy which fuels all his abilities. While in direct yellow sunlight, his strength can be augmented to incalculable and limitless levels. He has strength necessary to shatter entire worlds.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To observe intraocular pressure(IOP) and {{anterior}} chamber of healthy subjects {{by use of}} miotic in darkroom provocative test. METHODS: Series of cases were prospectively analyzed. Thirty healthy cases(60 eyes) aged 25 ～ 35 years-old were the objects of study. All tests were performed from 10 : 00 a. m. ～ 12 : 00 a. m. All subjects were sitted 1 h in the chairs opposite to let <b>head</b> <b>bend</b> down {{at the back of}} chair for 1 h in the first test. IOP and anterior segment paramater were measured by Pentacam before and after darkroom provocative test. The second test was repeated by use of pilocarpine as the above, and the data was compared with that of the previous test. RESULTS:IOP was increased significantly than before(P = 0. 000), pupil size(P = 0. 000), {{anterior chamber}} volume reduced(P = 0. 008) and anterior chamber angle was widened(P = 0. 017) which were significant difference in the first test. But central anterior chamber depth was not siginificant(P = 0. 261). IOP, anterior segment volume, anterior chamber angle and central anterior chamber depth were significant difference(P = 0. 000) in the second test. But there was no siginificant dfifference for pupil size(P = 0. 193). By use of pilocarpine anterior chamber volume(P = 0. 002), anterior chamber angle, central anterior chamber depth and pupil size were significant difference(P = 0. 000). IOP was not siginificant(P = 0. 21). CONCLUSION:Reduced anterior chamber volume and narrowed anterior chamber angle are the basis of positive darkroom provocative test. Pilocarpine can make anterior chamber angle widened and make it possible to decrease IOP. Physician should take pupil size into account when measure anterior segment paramater by Pentacam...|$|E

His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.|$|R
