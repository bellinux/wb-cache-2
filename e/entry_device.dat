5000|$|To {{protect the}} PIN during {{transmission}} from the PIN <b>entry</b> <b>device</b> to the verifier, the standard {{requires that the}} PIN be encrypted, and specifies several formats that may be used.

5000|$|All PIN entry devices shall allow {{entry of}} the digits zero to nine. Numeric keys {{may also have}} letters printed on them, e.g. as per E.161.

The standard also recommends that customers should be warned that not all devices may have letters.|$|E
50|$|While {{typewriters}} are {{the definitive}} ancestor of all key-based text <b>entry</b> <b>devices,</b> the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives {{largely from the}} utility of two devices: teleprinters (or teletypes) and keypunches.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the track-two data on the magnetic stripe, EMV cards generally have identical data encoded on the chip, which is read {{as part of the}} normal EMV transaction process. If an EMV reader is compromised {{to the extent that the}} conversation between the card and the terminal is intercepted, then the attacker may be able to recover both the track-two data and the PIN, allowing construction of a magnetic stripe card, which, while not usable in a Chip and PIN terminal, can be used, for example, in terminal devices that permit fallback to magstripe processing for foreign customers without chip cards, and defective cards. This attack is possible only where (a) the offline PIN is presented in plaintext by the PIN <b>entry</b> <b>device</b> to the card, where (b) magstripe fallback is permitted by the card issuer and (c) where geographic and behavioural checking may not be carried out by the card issuer.|$|E
