5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also <b>identified</b> <b>and</b> removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been <b>identified</b> <b>and</b> are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E

5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were <b>identified</b> <b>and</b> described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E

5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately <b>identified</b> <b>and</b> assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later <b>identified,</b> <b>and</b> a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide {{changes in the}} codons of amino acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (amino acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in amino acid substitutions (amino acid 19, 50, 133, and 219). Four SP-A1 variants (6A, 6A2, 6A3, 6A4) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 6A2.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the Japanese {{astronomer}} Kiyotsugu Hirayama {{began to}} study asteroid motions.

Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been <b>identified,</b> <b>and</b> these have semi-major axes between 2.50–2.82AU and inclinations of 33–38°.
