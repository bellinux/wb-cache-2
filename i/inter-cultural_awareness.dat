This study also emphasizes the development of pedagogical methods to increase KFL (Korean as a foreign language) learners’ <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> and overcome cultural prejudices, so that they can foster cultural and linguistic competence in inter-cultural business negotiations...|$|E

In the past, despite having similar goals of providing peer-support to foster a sense of community, such programs have operated in isolation. However, a recent initiative has seen {{the development of a}} core leadership training module, jointly designed and delivered by staff from Te Pūtahi Atawhai and Student Learning Support. Seeking to equip student-leaders with an understanding of some of the holistic Māori values, Kotahitanga (unity), Ako (teaching and learning), Manaakitanga (empathy/hospitality), Whakamana (respect), Whakanui (acknowledging success), Whakawhanaungatanga (building strong networks) and Rangatiratanga (ability to bring groups together/Self-direction), this core training offers the potential to strengthen Treaty of Waitangi relationships and nurture <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness,</b> developing a pan-university sense of belongingness in the process.  </em...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws from}} a study that {{explored}} issues of student equity, marginality and diversity in two secondary schools in regional Queensland (Australia). The paper foregrounds interview data gathered from administration, teaching and ancillary staff {{at one of the}} schools, ‘Crimson’ High School. The school has a high Indigenous student population and is well recognised within the broader community as catering well to this population. With reference to the school’s concerns about Indigenous disadvantage and the various approaches undertaken to address this disadvantage, the paper articulates the significance of educators being critically aware of how they construct race and use it as an organising principle in their work. This awareness is central to moving beyond the culturalism and racial incommensurability that tend to predominate within Indigenous education—where cultural reductionism homogenises indigeneity within and against a dominant White norm. With reference to a specific approach at the school designed predominantly for Indigenous male students—to foster <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> and respect through sport—we highlight ways in which notions of culturalism and racial incommensurability might be disrupted...|$|E
40|$|Does {{ethnicity}} {{matter in}} the media? If so, when {{and what is the}} role of ethnic and mainstream media in promoting the good news as well as the bad news about migrants and refugees? The results of an AEN quick-survey suggest that mainstream media is a key cross-over point for inter-cultural exchange and a primary vehicle for promoting <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> and understanding. Ethnic media publications provide an alternative to an increasingly homogenised mainstream media. They are essential to the health of a civic society and make an essential contribution to promoting and sustaining social movements. Communicating horizontally, rather than from the top down, ethnic media help to build communities, reduce social isolation and keep culture and language alive. They are able to bring about social change from within communities (Lalley & Hawkins, 2005). The news media play a major role in society around establishing and disseminating cultural references and are pivotal in representing and giving voice to community members. However, they can unintentionally strengthen racist discourses rather than fighting them (ERCOMER, 2002). According to a California New Media study, nearly a quarter of all U. S. residents regularly get information from the ethnic media (Briggs, 2005). A national, multilingual poll of almost 1, 900 Latino, African-American, Asian-American, Arab-American and American Indian respondents showed that 13 % o...|$|E
40|$|Tourism has {{increasingly}} been framed {{as a tool}} for educating global citizens (Hollinshead, 2009; Pritchard, Morgan, & Ateljevic, 2011). Responsible tourism practices in emerging economies have the capacity not only to increase <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness,</b> tolerance and understanding but to also facilitate creative initiatives through which long term change can emerge. In a separate and parallel stream of research and practice, micro-finance {{has increasingly}} become a tool to assist the poor, particularly those considered ‘unbankable’, to develop entrepreneurial activities. Often, microfinance has been used to assist in the production of arts and crafts, food services and other products consumed within the tourism system, but beyond that, the nexus between tourism and micro-finance has not been explored in any depth. In particular, the literature that combines these two areas is sparse, with only a few early attempts mentioning the inducement of local tourism-based projects through micro-loans (Hoeve ten, 2009; UNWTO, 2005). These do not reflect what is happening in practice, with various cross-over activities between microfinance and tourism increasingly taking place, and which arguably have potential to educate not only travellers but also a range of stakeholders operating within the microfinance-tourism nexus about global citizenship. This paper aims to address the gap in the literature by examining the promotion of global citizenship through the microfinance-tourism nexus from a stakeholder perspective. We argue that while practice has led {{research in the area of}} micro-finance and tourism to date, there is a growing need to better understand the potential opportunities and constraints of fostering global citizenship in this field in order to inform future debates in both theory and practice.

40|$|The thesis {{documents}} the historical, heritage and education context in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and discusses perceptions {{of values and}} identity in the postcolonial context. Previous research has examined the differing perspectives of indigenous peoples compared to European museum practice in the exhibition and preservation of cultural artefacts and the gradual progression towards collaborative working practices. However, {{the question of whether}} it is possible to teach awareness of those differing perspectives has been poorly addressed. This research builds on the current literature by exploring whether heritage professionals consider {{that it is possible to}} learn respect for differing cultural perspectives through the undertaking of training courses. In order to examine contemporary attitudes to communities and heritage institutions, knowledge and awareness of cultural values and perspectives on incorporating cultural values into educational programmes, the research investigation took the form of semi-structured interviews with 100 conservators, curators and educators working in New Zealand during the field research period of 2005 [...] 2006.;The participants' nationalities, professional working backgrounds and perceptions of cultural values, communities and education were examined, with the intention of determining their opinions relating to whether it was possible, necessary or desirable to incorporate cultural values into training programmes. Participants confirmed the view that museums are seen as the guardians of cultural artefacts and, therefore, they need to be inclusive of the communities who own those artefacts. Findings indicate that an awareness of one's own values and the recognition of difference are fundamental to facilitating understanding of the values and belief systems of other people. The research suggests that acquiring language skills and studying within a culture, with the people of that culture, rather than purely theoretically, could assist in gaining greater <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> and respect for differing perspectives...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that students from under-represented groups in universities undertake higher level study {{to enhance their}} career prospects {{and are more likely}} to seek out vocational courses. The UK government's current policy for higher education emphasises the need for higher level study to meet the skills needs of a knowledge economy. It thus advocates Foundation degree routes, work-based learning, fast-track degrees and part time provision as alternatives to full time, three year courses. It might be argued, however, that these developments are likely to result in a diversified sector in which research intensive institutions limit their teaching to an elite few who can afford access to 'higher education' and the critical thinking and creativity which is integral to it and teaching-only universities deliver skills and competences for work. Fears that under-represented groups are further marginalised by these processes obscure a more insidious problem - an assumption that such students are 'judgemental dopesï' incapable of reflection and reacting to learning in a positive way. One disadvantaged group in particular stands out - those young and adult learners taking vocational qualifications at Further Education or Community colleges. They are encouraged to apply to universities, if at all, for Foundation Degrees (the UK's primary mode of delivering higher level vocational qualifications) or other work-based routes as ends in themselves, on the assumption that they will already have internalised the norms which set limits to their aspiration. In other words, students from poor backgrounds may aspire to higher education, but only so high. This paper argues that there is no inherent incompatibility between skills for employment and the transferrable skills of problem solving, creativity and critical thinking. Furthermore in a global economy, transferrable skills need to take account of international contexts and ways of working which in turn require greater reflexivity, self- and <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness.</b> Using a range of examples such as engaging students as co-researchers and co-producers of content or developing 'shell' awards which allow learners to bring their own experience into their learning, it will argue that a skills-based reflexive curricula is not just desirable but also achievable...|$|E
40|$|Community {{languages}} schools (also {{known as}} ethnic or heritage languages schools) in Australia {{have not received}} much attention from sociologists and educational researchers, even though these schools are important and supplementary to mainstream schooling. This research explores the identity practices {{of a group of}} teenage Chinese-Australian students attending Huawen School (pseudonym), a weekend community language school in Victoria, Australia. The conceptual framework of this study draws on the sociological concepts of identity (Ang, 2001 b; S. Hall, 1996 a) and capital (Borjas, 1992; Bourdieu, 2004; Coleman, 1988; Zhou & Kim, 2006). The notion of capital is used as an analytical tool to understand how the different forms of capital are accumulated, invested and transformed in these young people’s weekend heritage language schooling. The fifteen Chinese-Australian teenagers who participated in this study were either born in Australia (the 2 nd-generation) or came to Australia by the age of sixteen (1. 5 -generation). The parents of these young people migrated to Australia from China between the 1980 s and 2000 s. Ethnography and related research methods were adopted, including individual interviews with fifteen students, six teachers and the Principal, observations of the teaching and learning activities and some school events, and the analysis of school newsletters and teaching materials. My own positionings as the researcher and as one of the Chinese teachers and parents in the school are also interrogated. Based on the research findings, I conclude that the identities of the participating 2 nd and 1. 5 -generation Chinese-Australian teenagers are multiple, shifting and contextual. My research participants consider physical features (‘White’/Asian), language (English/Chinese) and birthplace (Australia/China) as important markers of being Chinese and Australian {{and at the same time}} negotiate the different ethnic and cultural markers depending on the contexts within which they are located. They navigate beyond the binary of Chinese and Australian identity positionings, forging their own particular identities with significant internal heterogeneity due to their various personal experiences in relation to migration, family social-economic backgrounds, and the identity markers they want to, are able to or have to draw on under different circumstances. This group of Chinese teenagers often ascribe their better educational performances and achievements to certain Chinese ethnic markers, such as the hierarchical parent-child relationship, higher educational expectations, being hard working and competitive, while their Australian identities are often perceived as being marked by lenient parents, lowered educational expectations, loving sports, and being laid back. This study has also revealed that heritage language and culture are significant markers for ethnic identity, which provide these Chinese-Australian teenagers with the resilience and agency to negotiate their multiple identity positionings. The weekend Chinese school is an in-between bridging space where these Chinese-Australian teenagers acquire relevant educational information and support for their mainstream education, set up their own ethnic social network and develop their <b>inter-cultural</b> <b>awareness,</b> which are beneficial for them to form positive understandings of their ethnic identity and to accrue various forms of capital for their upward social mobility in Australia as well as globally...|$|E
