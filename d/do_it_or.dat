5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|On-site auctions – Sometimes {{when the}} stock or assets of a company are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to {{transport}} to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction {{within the confines of}} the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still plugged in, and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as they can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> at least supervise the activity.|$|E
500|$|Jagger's {{relationship}} with bandmate Keith Richards is frequently described as [...] "love/hate" [...] by the media. Richards himself {{said in a}} 1998 interview: [...] "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done." ...|$|E

500|$|The demo {{was very}} close to what Mottola wanted the {{finished}} product to be, according to Afanasieff. [...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: {{a day and a half}} for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing." ...|$|E
500|$|Tarkovsky {{chose to}} shoot the main film {{in black and white}} and the epilogue, showing some of Rublev's icons, in color. In an {{interview}} he motivated his choice with the claim that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors. Consequently, Rublev's life is in black and white, whereas his art is in color. The film was thus able to express the co-dependence of an artist's art and his personal life. In a 1969 interview, Tarkovsky stated that the flying man in the prologue is [...] "the symbol of daring, in the sense that creation requires from man the complete offering of his being. Whether one wishes to fly before it has become possible, or cast a bell without having learned how to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> paint an icon – all these acts demand that, for the price of his creation, man should die, dissolve himself in his work, give himself entirely." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon stated: [...] "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine {{that there}} was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is {{virtually}} the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement." [...] He told NME: [...] "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... not the way some daft Russian might <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism." [...] Ono described the lyrical statement of [...] "Imagine" [...] as [...] "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." [...] Rolling Stone described its lyrics as [...] "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an [...] "atheist anthem".|$|E

500|$|June {{is placed}} into witness {{protection}} at a motel by the Mississippi Highway Patrol. However, Pinker kidnaps June after killing the state trooper assigned to guard her. Pinker discovers his child is actually Trevor, {{who has been}} living with Jackie {{for the past several}} years as her child. Pinker attempts to kidnap Trevor, but is confronted by Mulder, who is armed with a shotgun loaded with rubber bullets. Pinker manages to evade Mulder and continues to chase after Trevor and Scully, whom he quickly corners. Scully, using Mulder's glass insulator hypothesis, locks herself inside a telephone booth with Trevor. [...] After failing to break into the telephone booth, Pinker sees his son trembling before him. Realizing that he does not want to scare his son anymore, Pinker decides to walk away. However, June appears and hits Pinker with her car; he passes through the metal components of the car, but not its glass windshield, and is cut in half as a result, killing him instantly. Mulder goes to June, who says she had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> else Pinker would have hurt Trevor. She then asks what he [...] wanted, to which Mulder replies [...] "Maybe another chance", causing June to cry.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think when you hear Kanye West <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour. Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] at his concerts: ...|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably going to do it, but I don't know exactly how we're going to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so}} many songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E

500|$|Unwilling {{to abandon}} her {{supporters}} within the Empire, the Empress {{demands that the}} Alliance march on the Begnion capital. However, as the now massive army prepares to depart, a messenger arrives from Daein demanding the surrender of the Empress to their custody {{on behalf of the}} senate. Realizing that they cannot advance with the threat of Daein to their north, the Alliance invades Daein. Micaiah and her army defend the border as long as possible, but are greatly outnumbered and are defeated. Suffering from battlefield fatigue, she returns to the capital to recover. While there she learns from King Pelleas of the true reason why they are fighting and resolves to fight on while the King researches a way to break the blood pact. The Daein army adopts increasingly unorthodox tactics, and through this are able to fight against the numerically superior Alliance. Their unshakable belief in Micaiah keeps the morale of the Daein soldiers high. In one engagement, Micaiah forces the Alliance to march down a narrow canyon road. She then employs boulders and burning oil to decimate the central army and Royal Knights. When she returns to the capital, Pelleas reveals {{that the only way to}} end the blood pact is to kill the signers, and he orders his own death; Micaiah can either do the deed herself, order one of their generals to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> refuse outright. Knowing that Daein remains heavily outnumbered, Ike orders the Alliance to assault a major Daein fort in an attempt to finish off the battered nation. The storming of the fort is ended by the arrival of Nailah and Prince Kurthnaga of the dragon laguz nation of Goldoa, who have learned of Daein's plight and sided with them. The next day a massive battle ensues, and the chaos begins to awaken Yune; Micaiah is forced to prematurely awaken her with the galdr of release. Yune's awakening also awakens the goddess of order Ashera.|$|E
