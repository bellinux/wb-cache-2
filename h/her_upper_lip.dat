500|$|Mona Simpson {{was drawn}} {{in a way}} so {{that she has a}} little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and her nose. There were several design changes because the {{directors}} were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be [...] "Simpson-esque".|$|E
500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, {{the bridge of her}} nose and around <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E

60|$|It was at {{this moment}} that Mr. Compton was called to the {{telephone}} in an adjoining room, {{and when he had}} gone the girl turned suddenly upon Jimmy Torrance. There was no cordiality nor friendship in her expression; a sneer upcurved <b>her</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R

500|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), {{voiced by}} Glenn Close, is Homer's {{deceased}} long-lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] where she reveals {{that she was}} forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] and the second being season six's [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode [...] "Mona Leaves-a", as Homer struggles {{to come to terms with}} her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's [...] "My Mother the Carjacker". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's [...] "D'oh-in in the Wind", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E
2500|$|Rola's {{television}} persona comprises distinctive characteristics, exuding {{an overall}} childlike naiveté, innocence, and playfulness. Signature affectations such as puffing her cheeks in embarrassment, holding an [...] "OK" [...] hand gesture over her cheek, and curling her tongue over <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> make Rola a common subject for Japanese impersonators, who also mimic her ditzy responses and constant giggles. She {{falls within the}} model-idol category of Japanese [...] "talent" [...] (tarento) as not actually possessing any particular talent, but Rola also presents comic possibilities by her mere presence. In the wake of Rola's popularity, aspiring talent Arie Mizusawa began appearing on Japanese television sporting cute affectations nearly identical to Rola, to an extent that entertainment media referred to Mizusawa as [...] "Rola 2" [...] and both she and Rola as [...] "twins".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{never before}} worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup [...] "rather daunting" [...] and {{described}} the three to four hour application process {{before moving on to}} costuming. [...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams' hands and <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> were visible. [...] After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to overexpress to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. [...] When she came back to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. [...] Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting {{was the name of the}} game when working under such protheses.|$|E
50|$|The film is {{a musical}} comedy, with the story {{focusing}} on Titsiana Booberini, an Italian check-out girl at a suburban supermarket who is ridiculed by her fellow employees for <b>her</b> slightly hirsute <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> Titsiana gains new confidence and acceptance when she discovers a hair removal treatment.|$|R
40|$|A 13 {{year old}} girl {{presented}} with aesthetic deformity of <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> since birth. She also presented with eyelid swelling {{on and off}} for 11 months. She was diagnosed to be a rare case of Ascher syndrome. Ascher syndrome commonly presents with double lip and blepharochalasis, sometimes associated with goitre. The deformity of <b>her</b> double <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> was corrected by appropriate surgery.

60|$|Mr. Sidney Wilton {{was much}} {{struck by the}} {{appearance}} of Lady Roehampton. He tried to compare the fulfilment of her promise with the beautiful and haughty child whom he used to wonder her parents so extravagantly spoiled. Her stature was above the average height of women and finely developed and proportioned. But it was in the countenance--in the pellucid and commanding brow, the deep splendour of her dark blue eyes softened by long lashes, <b>her</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and the rich profusion of her dark chestnut hair--that his roused memory recalled the past; and he fell into a mood of agitated contemplation.|$|R
50|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} that Keckler had {{died as a}} result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds. She had been stabbed six times in the back; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs. Her right wrist had a deep defensive wound gash, and her face had bruises on <b>her</b> left eye, <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and nose consistent with blunt force injury. The coroner found no signs of sexual assault.|$|R
60|$|For all the {{fatigues}} of the journey, the want of nourishing {{food and}} the haunting shadow of the suffering she had left, the face of Grace, flushed with the dying sun, was very pretty. The boy's dress she had borrowed was ill-fitting, and made her exquisite little figure still more diminutive, but it could not entirely hide its graceful curves. Here in this rosy light the swooning fringes of her dark eyes were no longer hidden; the perfect oval of her face, even the few freckles on <b>her</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> were visible to Philip. Partly as a physical support, partly to reassure her, {{he put his arm}} tenderly around her waist. Then he kissed her. It is possible that this last act was purely gratuitous.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{it right}} to fan this flame? Do you think any good end is being served?" [...] Waiting for her answer, he found himself gazing at the ghost of dark down on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> {{wondering}} {{that he had never}} noticed it before.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{shook her}} head. She was {{apparently}} French, {{and of the}} middle-class. She was dressed in black, her eyes and eyebrows were black, she had even {{the shadow of a}} moustache upon <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> To me her appearance was singularly forbidding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Clare, {{you have}} ranged the cows!" [...] she said, blushing; and {{in making the}} accusation, {{symptoms}} of a smile gently lifted <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> in spite of her, so as to show {{the tips of her}} teeth, the lower lip remaining severely still.|$|E
40|$|ImageS tical {{carcinoma}} (ACC) {{is a rare}} tumor {{accounting for}} 0. 2 % of all childhood cancers and has an incidence of 1 - 2 cases per 1. 7 million persons [2]. Until now, cutaneous metastases have rarely been reported. Herein, we report on a 4 -year-old girl who presented with an elevated mass resembling a cystic tumor on <b>her</b> right <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> that was diagnosed as metastatic ACC. A 4 -year-old girl who was diagnosed with Turner syndrome recently visited our hospital for the evalu-ation of a right maxillary area subcutaneous mass.

60|$|But, after all, the {{dominant}} current in those same veins {{was from the}} race of plain and prairie. The practiced eye detected it in the slender stateliness of carriage, in the graceful, yet voluptuous, curves of the lithe body, in the smallness and delicacy of hand and foot, in the purple sheen on straight-falling masses of blue-black hair, and, more than all else, in the long, dark eye, full and soft, yet alight with a slumbering fire. France, too, was responsible for somewhat in Tannis. It gave her a light step {{in place of the}} stealthy half-breed shuffle, it arched <b>her</b> red <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> into a more tremulous bow, it lent a note of laughter to her voice and a sprightlier wit to her tongue. As for her red-headed Scotch grandfather, he had bequeathed her a somewhat whiter skin and ruddier bloom than is usually found in the breeds.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} these cases is that of Saint Ebba (sometimes called Æbbe the Younger), the Mother Superior of the monastery of Coldingham Priory. In 867 AD, Viking pirates from Zealand and Uppsala landed in Scotland. When news of the raid reached Saint Ebba, she {{gathered}} her nuns together and urged them to disfigure themselves, {{so that they might}} be unappealing to the Vikings. In this way, they hoped to protect their chastity. She demonstrated this by cutting off <b>her</b> nose and <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and the nuns proceeded to do the same. The Viking raiders were so disgusted that they burned the entire building to the ground with the nuns inside.|$|R
60|$|The {{music of}} the waltz had ceased. Lady Maiden put her glasses to her eyes. From close beside them George and Mrs. Bellew passed by.

25|$|On 2 August, Chikatilo {{killed a}} 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, {{to the banks}} of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a {{shortcut}} to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, <b>her</b> excised <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> inside <b>her</b> mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old boy had been found strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|R

60|$|Left to herself, Maggie coolly {{pulled off}} her long boots and stockings, and comfortably opposed to the fire two very pretty feet and ankles, whose {{delicate}} purity was slightly blue-bleached by confinement in the tepid sea-water. The contrast of their waxen whiteness with her blue woolen skirt, and with even the skin of her sunburnt hands and wrists, apparently amused her, and she sat for some moments with her elbows on her knees, her skirts slightly raised, contemplating them, and curling her toes with evident satisfaction. The firelight playing upon the rich coloring of her face, the fringe of jet-black curls that almost met the thick sweep of eyebrows, and left her only a white strip of forehead, <b>her</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and small chin, rounded but resolute, completed a piquant and striking figure. The rich brown shadows on the smoke-stained walls and ceiling, the occasional starting into relief of the scutcheons of brilliant plumage, and the momentary glitter of the steel barrels, made a quaint background to this charming picture. Sitting there, and following some lingering memory of her tramp on the Marsh, she hummed to herself a few notes of the bugle call that had impressed her--at first softly, and finally with the full pitch of her voice.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} is composed through {{a mix of}} horizontal and vertical lines. The verticals of her head-dress blend into the lines of her shoulders and chest, while the horizontal folds of the veil are set against the line formed by <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> and lower <b>lips.</b> Given the individuality of her features, Rogier was obviously working from a life study of an actual person. Yet there are elements of abstraction in the image. The model is likely {{a member of the}} middle class, given her relatively plain dress, matronly features and accentuated breasts. [...] It is widely believed that she was modeled on the artist's wife, Elisabeth Goffaert, though this has not been proven. The portrait is similar to other female portraits by Rogier and Robert Campin. In fact, the similarity between Rogier's and Campin's female portraits is so strong that they were sometimes mis-attributed.|$|R
