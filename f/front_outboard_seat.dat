2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the drivers door window. Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{seat belt}} {{legislation}} varies by state. The state of Wisconsin introduced legislation in 1961 requiring seat belts to be fitted to the <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> positions of cars. [...] Seat belts have been mandatory equipment since the 1968 model year per Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. New York State passed the first {{law in the}} US mandating the use of seat belts in 1984 {{under the leadership of}} John D. States, an orthopedic surgeon who dedicated his career to improving automotive safety. [...] Depending on which state a driver is in, not wearing a seat belt in the front seat is either a primary offense or a secondary offense, with the exception of New Hampshire, which does not have a law requiring people over age 18 to wear a seat belt. In the front seat, the driver and each passenger must wear a seat belt, one person per belt. In some states, such as New York, New Hampshire, and Michigan, belts in the rear seats are not mandatory for people over the age of 16, though it is extremely advised. The driver and front-seat passengers aged 16 or older can be fined up to $50 each for failure to buckle up. In California, you must be 15 years or older to accompany the driver in the front seat. Children 14 and younger must sit in the rear seat until they reach the age of 15. A primary offense means that a police officer can pull a driver over for the seat belt law violation alone, and secondary offense indicates that one can be punished for a seat belt law violation only if they are already pulled over for another reason. By January 2007 25 states and the District of Columbia had primary seat belt laws, 24 had secondary seat belt laws, and New Hampshire had no laws. [...] In 2009, Public Health Law Research published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. One stated, [...] "Safety belt laws work, but there is strong evidence to support that primary enforcement safety belt laws are more effective than secondary enforcement laws in increasing seat belt use and reducing crash injuries." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{standard}} originally specified {{the type}} of occupant restraints (i.e., seat belts) required. It was amended to specify performance requirements for anthropomorphic test dummies <b>seated</b> in the <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seats</b> of passenger cars and of certain multi-purpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses, including the active and passive restraint systems. The purpose of the standard {{is to reduce the}} number of fatalities and the number and severity of injuries to occupants involved in frontal crashes.|$|R
50|$|As U.S. Federal {{safety rules}} {{increased}} throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Checkers kept pace and despite {{having the same}} basic body design, Checker enthusiasts can often identify the year of a Checker based on its safety equipment. For example, starting in 1963, amber parking/directional lights were used up front. 1964 models introduced lap belts in front, energy-absorbing steering columns came in 1967. 1968 models featured round side marker lights on fenders along with shoulder belts, and 1969s introduced headrests for <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions.|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} [...] "the Rambler American {{has done well}} at American Motors." [...] For its final model year, 1969, the [...] "American" [...] name was dropped as the car was now {{referred to as the}} [...] "American Motors Rambler". Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and cable throttle linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Rollover crashes {{involving}} 997 automobile {{occupants of}} the <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions were reviewed. Injury levels, using the Abbreviated Injury Scale, were studied for their association with ejection, restraint use, roof crush, car weight, and the absence or. presence of the B-pillar. The results indicate that he more serious injuries and fatalities are sustained by those jected from the car, with ejection occurring most often through the side glass area. Restraints are related to less severe injuries to the non-ejected occupant {{as well as to}} a reduced rate of ejection. Roof crush is found to be a factor that interacts with restraint use and with the vehicle factors...|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1980s, three-point belts were {{commonly}} {{available only}} in the <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seats</b> of cars; the back seats were only often fitted with lap belts. Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis, or [...] "seat belt syndrome", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require 3-point belts first in all <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles. Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat. Besides regulatory changes, [...] "seat belt syndrome" [...] has led to tremendous liability for vehicle manufacturers. One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against the Ford Motor Company; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.|$|R
2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as shoulder belts for <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|R
50|$|In September 2004 for the 2005 model year, the FX range {{received}} enhancements such as {{lane departure warning}} (LDW) {{system that}} helps alert drivers to an unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane. Infiniti's system monitored the lane markings to alert passengers via an audible buzzer that the driver is drifting unintentionally. The LDW system, which utilize a small camera, speed sensor, an indicator and an audible warning buzzer, was offered on models. The Infiniti FX was the first passenger vehicle to offer a lane departure warning system in the United States market. In addition to LDW, the 2005 Infiniti FX range was now equipped with standard roof-mounted curtain supplemental curtain air bags with rollover protection for <b>front</b> and rear <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> occupants.|$|R
40|$|Lap belts, {{fitted to}} cenve seats of Ausvalian cars {{for the past}} fifteen years, have come under {{criticism}} as being injurious to children. The weight of evidence is that they provide substantial protection, though less than three point belts. A specific injury, the seat belt syndrome (SBS), to abdominal viscera and/or lumbar spine, {{has been associated with}} lap belts, an association confirmed by IWO studies in Melbourne. The incidence of SBS was calculated from Transport Accident Commission claims. The centre rear seat (lap belt) carried three times the risk of SBS as <b>outboard</b> rear <b>seats</b> (three point belts) which in turn have 2. 7 times the risk of the <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> The number of SBS cases in Victoria has increased with penetration of the fleet by post 1971 cars. The annual estimated number of cases, for 1987, is 186 adults and ten children. Suggestions are made for irnprovcrnents in the restraint system...|$|R
5000|$|A 6 air bag {{supplementary}} {{restraint system}} (SRS) with 10-way occupant protection is standard on Expedition. The occupant protection system consists of dual front SRS air bags with Personal Safety System (PSS), SafetyCanopy dual side curtain air bags, and new dual front side air bags for dedicated upper torso protection. The side air bags {{are similar to}} the ones used on the first generation Expedition, and are denoted by a small identification tag reading [...] "Air bag" [...] stitched onto the <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> bolsters. The aforementioned SafetyCanopy dual side curtain air bag system was redesigned to include third row seating and features multi-chamber inflation, roll-fold technology, and extended inflation after deployment. SafetyCanopy will deploy along the A, B, C and D-pillars down to the vehicle's beltline.|$|R
5000|$|For 1968, Lincoln {{made several}} styling {{changes to the}} Continental. To meet federal safety standards, the parking lights, taillights, and front turn signals were {{returned}} to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights. For the <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> shoulder seatbelts were added. The new 460 cid L Ford 385 engine was to be available {{at the beginning of}} the model year, but there were so many 462 cid L Ford MEL engine engines still available, the 460 was phased in later that year. In April, the new Mark III made its debut, as a 1969 model. Total sales would be down to just 39,134. [...] For the 1968 through 1971 Model Years, no stand-up hood ornament was used, some say based on a presumed forthcoming regulatory ban that never eventuated.|$|R
5000|$|The 1966 Furys {{kept the}} same profile as the 1965s, with a split front and rear grill motif. For 1967, the body was restyled with a sharp, angular profile. The stacked quad {{headlight}} bezels were curvier and set more deeply into the body, giving the car a more muscular look. The rooflines had sharper angles and gave the car a longer, more luxurious appearance. A new, formal two-door hardtop body style appeared which featured smaller rear quarter windows and a wider, back-slanted [...] "C" [...] pillar. Called the [...] "fast top," [...] it was offered alongside the restyled thin [...] "C" [...] pillar hardtop in both VIP and Sport Fury series (as well as on corresponding big Dodge models). The 1967 model year introduced new safety regulations, which meant {{that for the first}} time, all Plymouths included dual-circuit brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, recessed instrument panel controls, and shoulder belt mounting points for <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants.|$|R
50|$|The 1975 {{models were}} {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} 1974s, except for a new grille and that California and some high-altitude models were equipped with catalytic converters and so required unleaded gasoline. All 1975 models were required to pass a roof crush test and to meet this stringent requirement, additional reinforcements were added to all Dart 2-door hardtops. Heavy gauge steel in the windshield pillar area had been incorporated into the windshield, pillar and roof design. Darts were also equipped with an improved energy absorbing steering column which used multiple slots in the column jacket to replace prior used convoluted mesh design. At impact, force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a mandrel mounted on the floor. Federal Motor Safety Standards briefly required that the front seat belts include a starter interlock system that prevented the engine from starting unless the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>outboard</b> occupant and the driver fastened their belts.|$|R
500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic {{stability control system}} with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for <b>front</b> and rear <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions, with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash. Crush zones framing the trunk and the engine crumple to absorb crash energy before it reaches occupants. Door hinges and latches in harmony with door structure and its steel reinforcements to keep doors closed during an impact. The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was named [...] "Top Safety Pick" [...] by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Volt received the top ratings of [...] "Good" [...] for front, side, and rear impact crash tests, and also on rollover protection. All injury measurements except one were rated good, indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes according to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS’s testing. The Volt's lower rating of [...] "Acceptable" [...] was for torso injuries.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "sash" [...] or {{shoulder}} harness is a strap that goes diagonally over the vehicle occupant's outboard shoulder and is buckled inboard {{of his or}} her lap. The {{shoulder harness}} may attach to the lap belt tongue, or it may have a tongue and buckle completely separate from those of the lap belt. Shoulder harnesses of this separate or semi-separate type were installed in conjunction with lap belts in the <b>outboard</b> <b>front</b> <b>seating</b> positions of many vehicles in the North American market starting at the inception of the shoulder belt requirement of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 on 1 January 1968. However, if the shoulder strap is used without the lap belt, the vehicle occupant is likely to [...] "submarine", or slide forward in the seat and out from under the belt, in a frontal collision. In the mid-1970s, 3-point belt systems such as Chrysler's [...] "Uni-Belt" [...] began to supplant the separate lap and shoulder belts in American-made cars, though such 3-point belts had already been supplied in European vehicles such as Volvos, Mercedes, and Saabs for some years.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, {{coinciding with}} the {{exterior}} updates, the interior also saw a major upgrade. Along {{with the addition of}} a driver's side airbag and three-point seatbelts for all six <b>outboard</b> <b>seats,</b> the dashboard was redesigned with improved controls (many shared with the 1992 Econoline) and a new instrument panel. In 1993, integrated child safety seats were introduced as an option.|$|R
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|R
50|$|After {{nine years}} with only detail {{changes to the}} body and trim, the Colony Park {{received}} a major update alongside the Grand Marquis for 1988. From the windshield forward, a more aerodynamic front end better integrated the fenders, grille, headlights, and bumpers. Inside, the front seats were modernized. For 1990, {{as part of an}} addition of a driver's side airbag, the entire instrument panel and dashboard received a redesign; all <b>outboard</b> <b>seats</b> received 3-point seatbelts.|$|R

40|$|Results of {{a direct}} {{observation}} of safety belt and motorcycle helmet use in Michigan for Fall of 1993 are reported. The current survey represents a complete departure from the procedures and sample design used in previous surveys. In the present survey, 17, 719 <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> occupants were observed in 13, 669 passenger vehicles between September 2 and September 23, 1993. Statewide shoulder belt use for <b>front</b> <b>outboard</b> occupants in passenger vehicles was 64. 4 percent. This shoulder belt use rate represents the highest use rate found in any previous University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute survey. It also shows an increase in belt use of around 13 percent since the most recent survey conducted 15 months earlier. In the current survey, 177 motorcycle riders were observed on 150 motorcycles. Of all motorcycle riders observed, all passengers and all but one driver were using helmets, a use rate of 99. 4 percent.
