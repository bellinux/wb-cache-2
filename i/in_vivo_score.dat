40|$|New {{regenerative}} {{materials and}} approaches {{need to be}} assessed through reliable and comparable methods for rapid translation to the clinic. There is a considerable need for proven in vitro assays {{that are able to}} reduce the burden on animal testing, by allowing assessment of biomaterial utility predictive of the results currently obtained through in vivo studies. The purpose of this multicentre review was to investigate the correlation between existing in vitro results with in vivo outcomes observed for a range of biomaterials. Members from the European consortium BioDesign, comprising 8 universities in a European multicentre study, provided data from 36 in vivo studies and 47 in vitro assays testing 93 different biomaterials. The outcomes of the in vitro and in vivo experiments were scored according to commonly recognised measures of success relevant to each experiment. The correlation of in vitro with in vivo scores for each assay alone and in combination was assessed. A surprisingly poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo assessments of biomaterials was revealed indicating a clear need for further development of relevant in vitro assays. There was no significant overall correlation between in vitro and in vivo outcome. The mean in vitro scores revealed a trend of covariance to <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>score</b> with 58  %. The inadequacies of the current in vitro assessments highlighted here further stress the need for the development of novel approaches to in vitro biomaterial testing and validated pre-clinical pipelines...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we showed {{the ability of}} technetium- 99 m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) scan to identify active disease in patients with multiple myeloma (Eur J Nucl Med 1998; 25 : 714 – 720). In particular, a semiquantitative score of the extension and in- tensity of bone marrow uptake was derived and correlated with both the clinical status {{of the disease and}} plasma cell bone marrow infiltration. In order to estimate quantitatively 99 mTc-MIBI bone marrow uptake and to verify the intracellular localization of the tracer, bone marrow samples obtained from 24 multiple myeloma patients, three patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and two healthy donors were studied for in vitro uptake. After centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, cell suspensions were in- cubated with 99 mTc-MIBI and the uptake was expressed as the percentage of radioactivity specifically retained within the cells. The cellular localization of the tracer was assessed by micro-autoradiography. Twenty-two out of 27 patients underwent 99 mTc-MIBI scan within a week of bone marrow sampling. Whole-body images were ob- tained 10 min after intravenous injection of 555 MBq of the tracer; the extension and intensity of 99 mTc-MIBI uptake were graded using the semiquantitative score. A statistically significant correlation was found between in vitro uptake of 99 mTc-MIBI and both plasma cell infil- tration (Pearson's coefficient of correlation r= 0. 69, P< 0. 0001) and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>score</b> (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r= 0. 60, P< 0. 01). No specific tracer uptake was found in bone marrow samples obtained from the two healthy donors. Micro-autoradiography showed localization of 99 mTc-MIBI inside the plasma cells infiltrating the bone marrow. Therefore, our findings show that the degree of tracer uptake both in vitro and in vivo is re- lated to the percentage of infiltrating plasma cells which accumulate the tracer in their inner compartments...|$|E

40|$|The enucleated eye {{test with}} chicken eyes (CEET) {{obtained}} from an abattoir {{proved to be}} a valuable and practical alternative for the 'traditional' enucleated eye test with eyes of laboratory rabbits. Since 1992, the CEET has been incorporated in standard contract toxicity testing at the Toxicology Division of the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute as a (pre) screen for the Draize eye test with rabbits. The results of the first 44 compounds tested showed excellent correlation with the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> results. The CEET identified non-irritating or severely irritating compounds, and predicted (slightly to moderately) irritating compounds.

40|$|A {{simplified}} 3 -point scale {{method for}} <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>scoring</b> body condition is proposed as an useful and rapid tool to support experimental and on-farm management of nutrition and reproduction of rabbit does. The productive responses of lactating rabbit does scored and inseminated at 11 days post partum (pp) are verified, {{as well as}} performance of non-pregnant does scored and re-inseminated at 32 days pp when non-lactating. After their first parturition, 96 New Zealand White rabbit does were checked for 126 days over three successive 42 -day reproductive cycles. The body condition scoring was based on feel by hand the loin and the rump for bone protrusions and muscle fullness. The loin was evaluated for poor, intermediate and wide level, the rump for poor and wide level. The body condition was scored “ 0 ” with poor loin; “ 1 ” with intermediate loin and poor rump; “ 2 ” with intermediate and wide loin and wide rump. The highest fertility was obtained with intermediate body condition score (BCS) for both lactating (52. 0, 84. 9 and 58. 6 % for BCS 0, 1 and 2; P< 0. 001) and non-lactating does (53. 1, 84. 4 and 64. 5 % for BCS 0, 1 and 2; P< 0. 05), indicating the negative effect of poor or excessive body fatness. A poor BCS led to lower litter size at birth in lactating (7. 2, 8. 2 and 8. 3 for BCS 0, 1 and 2) and non-lactating does (8. 4, 11. 1 and 9. 6 for BCS 0, 1 and 2; P< 0. 05), and higher losses of kit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Prior {{research}} has found that pain catastrophizing measured before pain testing is not correlated with the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold (a measure of spinal nociception), suggesting that catastrophizing does not alter pain through descending modulatory mechanisms. However, recent evidence suggests that <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> catastrophizing (measured during or after pain testing) is a better predictor of pain outcomes. In the present study, NFR threshold and pain sensation ratings were assessed in 78 healthy participants by delivering electric stimulations to the sural nerve. After pain testing, participants were asked to rate their affective reaction (displeasure, arousal) to electric stimuli and to report on their pain catastrophizing. Hierarchical regression analyses controlling for participant sex, pre-experiment affect, depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy were used to predict pain-related outcomes (NFR threshold, pain sensation, displeasure ratings, arousal ratings) from <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> catastrophizing <b>scores.</b> Results indicated that <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> catastrophizing was related to pain sensation but not to NFR thresholds or arousal reactions. The relation between <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> catastrophizing and displeasure ratings was not significant after other variables were controlled. These data support prior research suggesting that catastrophizing does not alter pain by engaging descending modulatory mechanisms. Perspective: Pain catastrophizing is an important psychological predictor of pain and pain-related functioning. The present study confirms prior reports suggesting that catastrophizing does not work by engaging mechanisms that alter pain transmission in the spinal cord before the signal travels to the brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{high levels}} of genetic {{diversity}} shown by hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly attributed to the low fidelity of its polymerase. However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals {{the rate at which}} they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> by <b>scoring</b> premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8. 7 × 10 - 5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses...|$|R

For the in vitro model, differential transcriptomic gene expression of S. aureus and its codY mutant grown in chemically defined medium (CDM), AH, and VH was analyzed. Furthermore, the strains were inoculated into the AC of mice. Changes in bacterial growth, electroretinography and inflammation scores were monitored. Bovine AH and VH provide sufficient nutrition for S. aureus growth in vitro. Transcriptome analysis identified 72 unique open reading frames differentially regulated ≥ 10 -fold between CDM, AH, and VH. In the AC model, we found comparable growth of the codY mutant and wild type strains <b>in</b> <b>vivo.</b> Average inflammation <b>scores</b> and retinal function were significantly worse for codY mutant-infected eyes at 24 h post-infection. Our in vitro bovine AH and VH models identified likely nutrient sources for S. aureus in the ocular milieu.

Six pens with five heifers (3 BB BS, 1 BB Si, 1 BB Re) and six pens with four young bulls (2 BB BS, 1 BB Si, 1 BB Re) were used. In total 53 crossbred calves were tested: 30 from BS dams and 23 from dual purpose (12 from Si and 11 from Re dams). Growth performances were measured, carcases were scored for muscle conformation and fatness, the fifth rib was dissected, and the Longissimus thoracis (LT) was analysed. The maternal breed had significant effects when the calves from dairy cows (BB BS) were compared {{to those of the}} dual pur- pose breeds (BB Si and BB Re), as at slaughter the former were 1. 2 % taller, 6. 0 % less <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> muscle <b>score,</b> 5. 0 % less carcase muscle score, with a 13 % greater proportion of bone in the rib, and their LT had 12. 5 % less drip losses, but 3 % greater cooking losses and 25 % greater shear force. It was concluded that when using a BB as a sire, the dam breed has influ- ence on the growth performance traits of the derived crossbreds, but the major influence would regard the carcase and meat quality traits.

Keywords: Heritability; Correlation; Conformation; Muscularity; Growth; Ultrasonic measurementsThis study investigated the genetic relationships of <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> measures of shape and muscularity with eight week weight, scan weight, ultrasonic measures of the depth of muscle (UMD) and fat (UFD) and body dimensions at twenty weeks of age. Data were recorded in two purebred Texel flocks that were managed in a common environment and selected for either lean tissue growth rate or conformation of the hind limb (LSC). A muscularity score (MUSC) was derived as UMD/body length. Estimates of direct heritabilities were 0. 07, 0. 19, 0. 20, 0. 32, 0. 32 and 0. 62 for eight week weight, scan weight, UMD, logUFD, MUSC and LSC respectively. Maternal genetic effects were not significant for logUFD, MUSC and LSC and were 0. 10, 0. 09 and 0. 04 for eight week weight, scan weight and UMD respectively. The genetic correlation between LSC and MUSC was 0. 61 and both traits tended to be negatively correlated with live weights (- 0. 09 to - 0. 36 ? 0. 17) and uncorrelated with logUFD. The heritabilities of body dimensions ranged from 0. 11 for hook width to 0. 55 for shoulder height and all measurements were strongly correlated genetically to scan weight (0. 52 to 0. 89). LSC was negatively correlated (- 0. 58) to shoulder height and body length. These results suggest that LSC {{could be used to}} select for improved muscularity in Texel sheep. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Body {{condition}} scoring (BCS) {{is widely}} {{used to evaluate the}} nutritional status of livestock (cows, ewes, sows). In intensive systems, rabbit does are generally inseminated 11 days post partum and, due to a hormonal antagonism and an energy deficit caused by concurrent lactation and pregnancy, they show low fertility. The aim of this investigation was to assess an <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> method for <b>scoring</b> the body condition of does by verifying the association with the body fat depots, the chemical composition of body tissues, the ovarian status, the hormonal response and the reproductive performance. The evaluation of BCS, involving 66 multiparous lactating does inseminated at 11 days post partum, was based on the test of bone protrusions and fullness of muscle of the loin, rump and hind leg. The traits were subjectively scored using 0, 1 and 2 for poor, intermediate and good condition, respectively. For calculating an aggregate BCS, the hind leg score was omitted, because it is less correlated with the real body condition. Adding the respective score (0 – 2) of the loin and rump regions, 5 classes of BCS were obtained (0 – 4). This aggregate BCS was highly correlated with the body fat depots (r = 0. 79), the ether extract content of muscle samples of Obliquus abdominis (r = 0. 87) and Biceps femoris (r = 0. 84), and the ether extract of the empty body (r = 0. 84).

However, involvement of VEGF-B, one of these factors, in angiogenesis remains obscure. Mice received subcutaneous injection of Matrigel alone or Matrigel with human recombinant protein rhVEGF-B 167 or with rhVEGF-A 165. After 14 days, cell ingrowth in the Matrigel plug was increased by 2. 0 - and 2. 5 -fold in rhVEGF-B 167 – treated and rhVEGF-A 165 –treated mice, respectively (P 0. 01), in association with a raise in phospho-Akt/Akt (1. 8 -fold, P 0. 01) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (1. 80 - and 1. 60 -fold, respectively; P 0. 05) protein levels measured by Western blot. VEGF-B–induced cell ingrowth was impaired by treatment with NOS inhibitor (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; L-NAME, 10 mg/kg per day). Treatment with neutralizing antibody directed against the VEGF-B receptor VEGF-R 1 (anti-VEGFR 1, 10 g) completely abrogated VEGF-B–related effects. Proangiogenic effect of VEGF-B was confirmed in a mouse model of surgically induced hindlimb ischemia.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune, {{inflammatory disease}} that affects synovial joints. A key characteristic of RA is hyperplasia of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) which develop a stable, auto-aggressive phenotype that augments tissue destruction. It is unknown how this phenotype is stably maintained; however, epigenetic {{changes have been}} implicated. Histone deacetylation is one proposed method; a process controlled by histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, there have recently been reports publishing conflicting data regarding the expression of HDACs in RA synovium and FLS. The objective of this thesis {{is to determine the}} role of HDACs in regulating the auto-aggressive phenotype of RA through studies in FLS and in mice. Real time-quantitative PCR was used to assess the levels of HDAC 1 - 11 in RA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) FLS. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to assess protein expression of HDAC 1 in RA and OA synovial tissue and FLS. HDAC 1 was found to be overexpressed in RA compared to OA. HDAC 1 was knocked down in RA FLS, then cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed by using tritiated thymidine, a scratch assay and a Matrigel invasion assay respectively. All three functions were significantly reduced following HDAC 1 knockdown. An Illumina BeadChip (47, 000 transcripts) was used to analyse global gene expression changes after knockdown. This revealed significant gene changes in important functional clusters, such as proliferation and migration. HDAC 1 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, so the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> role of HDAC 1 was investigated in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) using <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> siRNAs. Clinical <b>scores</b> of CIA were measured daily and HDAC 1 knockdown mice showed a significantly reduced clinical score compared to controls, comparable to dexamethasone-treated mice. The bones were analysed using a microCT scanner and histology. Knocking down HDAC 1 showed reduced bone erosion, joint inflammation and cartilage degradation compared to controls. Overall, this study shows that HDAC 1 is dysregulated in RA and it has {{a significant role in the}} autoaggressive phenotype shown in RA FLS and collagen-induced arthritis. The novel data shown in this thesis demonstrates that inhibiting HDAC 1 may provide a powerful new target for treating RA. ...|$|R

Using Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (osteonectin) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 as model targets, we show that: 1) fluorescently labeled phage retains target specificity on labeling; 2) <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> distribution can be quantitated (detection thresholds of ~ 300 phage/mm 3 tissue) throughout the entire depth of the tumor using fluorescent tomographic imaging; and 3) fluorescently labeled phage itself {{can serve as a}} replenishable molecular imaging agent. The described method should find widespread application in the rapid <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> discovery and validation of affinity ligands and, importantly, in the use of fluorochrome-labeled phage clones as <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> imaging agents...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a three-dimensional testicular co-culture system (3 D-TCS) which mimics <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> testes. <b>In</b> this study, transcriptomic responses to phthalate esters (PE's) were compared in the 3 D-TCS with responses in rat testes <b>in</b> <b>vivo.</b> Microarray data from the 3 D-TCS and from <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> testes were used to compare changes in gene expression patterns after exposure to developmentally toxic (DTPE) or developmentally non-toxic (DNTPE) phthalate esters. DTPE treatments clustered separately from DNTPE treatments based on principle components analysis both in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo.</b> Pathway analysis using GO-Elite software showed that terms relating to steroid metabolism or reproductive development were enriched both in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> after DTPE exposure. Processes such as cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis were enriched for DTPE treatments in vitro, but not <b>in</b> <b>vivo.</b> Based on these analyses we concluded that transcriptomic responses in the 3 D-TCS reflect key aspects of <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> phthalate toxicity...|$|R

30|$|Comparative {{analyses}} of the agreement of chemical and toxicological approaches to the identification of potential EA-EDs in fish were based on receptor-based in vitro assays and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> mammalian long-term reproduction studies.

For 51 substances, <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> {{as well as in}} vitro data were available. The minor overlap of the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> and <b>in</b> vitro datasets with only 51 chemicals shows that for many <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> reproductive toxicants <b>in</b> rodents, the corresponding in vitro results that could specify the relevant modes of action have not been published.|$|R
