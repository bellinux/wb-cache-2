500|$|Rowe {{announced}} {{that she was pregnant}} with Jackson's second child in November 1997. The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed that he was so anxious following the birth of his daughter, that he [...] "snatched" [...] her and ran straight home [...] "with all the placenta and <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> over her". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen. Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, {{in the hope that the}} Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter. An official for the Pope informed Jackson by letter that the leader of the Catholic Church would not participate in what may be perceived as a publicity stunt.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Lee of The Guardian {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "despite the film {{constantly}} informing you of just how incredibly important <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place." [...] He blames Sorkin's [...] "dominating" [...] script, arguing that [...] "the dialogue stifles" [...] and that [...] "the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own." [...] He also feels that while it is [...] "Boyle's best film for years," [...] his direction [...] "plays second fiddle" [...] to a script that verges {{on a kind of}} [...] "Apple-sponsored hero iWorship." [...] Joe Nocera of The New York Times, who knew Jobs well, took issue with [...] "how little the film {{has to do with the}} flesh and blood Steve Jobs."

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make <b>everything</b> <b>all</b> right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up". She stated that [...] "the fact that it offered no easy solutions and gave us that super-bleak ending was enough to win me over".|$|E

Peter Studebaker built the first Studebaker mill and a wagon road. Broadfording Wagon Road was built to run through the property. Peter owned property {{on both sides of the}} Conococheague creek, so he built a bridge over the creek in 1747. Peter began the family business on the Bakers Lookout property where he made his home, and built the first Studebaker wagon factory. In this factory Peter manufactured <b>everything,</b> <b>all</b> necessities including products he made in Solingen Germany and naturally wagons. Bakers Lookout, the 1740, 100-acre land patent, Hagerstown, Maryland, was the first of many land patents to be acquired by Peter Studebaker.
