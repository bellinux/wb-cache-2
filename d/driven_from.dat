5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E

Fewer than one percent of Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944. Approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion.

5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not entirely <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> Northern England, and in the 1970s the region was home to several strong teams.

5|$|The {{following}} year, the Annals of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. The Annals of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054, as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be evidence to suggest that, when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} this summer retreat {{was in a}} secluded hollow. It had {{originally}} been owned by the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo.

The estate and its hunting lodge then {{became one of the}} many properties of the Portuguese king, João IV. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of João V.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{the above}} details are {{accurate}} or not, {{it is clear}} that Svein, Olaf the Swede and Eirik had ample reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had taken control of Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on friendly terms with Olaf the Swede and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been <b>driven</b> <b>from</b> his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E
