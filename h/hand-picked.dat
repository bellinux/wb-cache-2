5|$|McRaven <b>hand-picked</b> a team {{drawing from}} the most {{experienced}} and senior operators from Red Squadron, one of four that make up DEVGRU. Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention. The team had language skills and experience with cross-border operations into Pakistan. Almost all of the Red Squadron operators had 10 or more deployments to Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jean-Pierre Lafitte {{defeated}} Bob Holly {{in a standard}} dark match. In the weeks preceding the event, the WWF ran a competition to win a house in Orlando, Florida. Todd Pettengill and Stephanie Wiand showed footage {{of the home and}} later <b>hand-picked</b> one of the entries. They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada and told him that he and his family had won the vacant home. The home was officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|Bomb {{engineering}} {{was carried}} out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests. By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia. As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty <b>hand-picked</b> regular officers.|$|E
5|$|President Davis {{met with}} his Confederate Cabinet {{for the last time}} on May 5, 1865, in Washington, Georgia, and officially {{dissolved}} the Confederate government. The meeting took place at the Heard house, the Georgia Branch Bank Building, with 14 officials present. Along with their <b>hand-picked</b> escort led by Given Campbell, Davis and his wife Varina Davis were captured by Union forces on May 10 at Irwinville in Irwin County, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially <b>hand-picked</b> the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} loss of the battle Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a <b>hand-picked</b> group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a <b>hand-picked</b> group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was <b>hand-picked</b> by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his <b>hand-picked</b> leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their <b>hand-picked</b> manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|Following the abdication of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia—and {{beyond it}} India—open to the Turkish Army. The War Office {{responded with a}} plan to send a force of <b>hand-picked</b> British {{officers}} and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. This force became known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character of Rudyard Kipling's novel Stalky & Co.. It arrived in Baku in August 1918. It was hoped that Dunsterforce could raise an army from the Christian Georgian, Armenian and Assyrian people who had supported the Russians and had historically feared the Turks. While Dunsterforce had some success the task proved beyond its ability.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous <b>hand-picked</b> {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In season eight, Lex {{is missing}} and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is put in}} charge as Lex's <b>hand-picked</b> successor. Tess wants Lex found, until Lex is {{revealed}} to have a surgically-implanted nano-transmitter in Tess's optic nerve. Wanting revenge, Lex uses a kryptonite bomb to have Lana's stolen bio-enhanced suit, designed to absorb and emit kryptonite radiation, absorb the radiation to de-activate the bomb and subsequently {{never be able to}} go near Clark again without fatal effects. Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) discovers Lex's location and uses a bomb to blow up Lex's travelling medical transport, seemingly killing him.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina again {{consulted}} Day on {{the prospective}} engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age difference was too great, although Bicknell {{was only two}} years older than Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sabrina the truth about the experiment, that she was <b>hand-picked</b> to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sabrina wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was born}} in Cincinnati in 1857. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War. William Taft {{attended}} Yale {{and was a member}} of Skull and Bones secret society like his father, and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's <b>hand-picked</b> successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves <b>hand-picked</b> a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{musical score}} of Sonic Generations was {{primarily}} composed by Jun Senoue, with contributions by Richard Jacques, Hideki Naganuma, Crush 40, and Cash Cash, among others. The soundtrack consists of remixed versions of past tracks, alongside new material {{written for the}} game. Several soundtrack albums were released alongside the game. History of the First Stage features music from the first levels of several Sonic franchise games. Sonic Generations: 20 Years of Sonic Music contains several tracks <b>hand-picked</b> by Sonic Team, and was sold with the collector's edition. The complete, three-volume soundtrack, Sonic Generations Original Soundtrack: Blue Blur, was released on January 11, 2012, under Sega's Wave Master label. It spans three discs and features 90 total tracks from both versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the <b>hand-picked</b> candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was <b>hand-picked</b> by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By {{the time that he}} became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers <b>hand-picked</b> to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{was chosen}} {{president}} pro tem of the Senate for the 1898 legislative session. On February 1, 1898, he sponsored a measure later called the Goebel Election Law. The law created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed by the}} General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties and were empowered to decide disputed elections. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving to Goebel; it was opposed even by some Democrats. Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Governor Bradley's veto, making the bill law. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially <b>hand-picked</b> {{the members of the}} Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats—W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Court of Appeals found it constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{first got}} the idea to stage what became the 1974 Music Festival from India during the Bombay {{sessions}} for his debut solo album, the 1968 film soundtrack Wonderwall Music, after hearing Shankar's orchestral work Nava Rasa Ranga. While in India in early 1974, Shankar and Harrison planned the venture, which consisted of a European tour by Shankar's <b>hand-picked</b> orchestra of Indian classical musicians, after which the ensemble would tour North America with Harrison and his band of Western musicians. For his orchestra, Shankar selected regular accompanists such as tabla player Alla Rakha and singers Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty; other established players including Shivkumar Sharma (santoor), Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute), Rijram Desad (percussion) and Kamalesh Maitra (tabla tarang); and musicians that went on to establish themselves internationally {{as a result of}} their participation, such as violinist L. Subramaniam and sarangi player Sultan Khan.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Walter Loving sought, and was granted, {{a medical}} {{disability}} due to worsening tuberculosis. He was replaced {{as director of}} the band by Pedro B. Navarro. Navarro had been with the PC Band since 1902, served as Loving's assistant conductor since 1904, and took over when Loving fell ill during the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition. He was succeeded by José Silos in 1918. During this period the quality of the band suffered and, in 1920, Loving returned to the Philippines to rebuild the group. As part of his long-term plan to ensure the future stability of the band, he <b>hand-picked</b> bandsman Alfonso Fresnido to succeed him. Fresnido was sent to Ohio to study conducting at the Dana Music Institute (now the Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University) before returning to take over the band from Loving, who retired a second time in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 {{threatened}} {{to derail the}} 1942 season, but most college teams played on, adjusting schedules to include military teams composed of players serving in the military. The Buckeyes opened the season by beating a Fort Knox team 59–0, followed by two more wins against Southern California and Indiana University. In the first AP Poll of the season, Ohio State was ranked best in the nation, {{the first time the}} school had achieved that mark. The 1942 team was the first composed mainly of players <b>hand-picked</b> by Brown, including Bill Willis, Dante Lavelli and star halfback Les Horvath. In the middle of the season, the Buckeyes lost to the University of Wisconsin after numerous players drank bad water and got sick. That was the team's only loss of the season, which culminated with a 21–7 victory over Michigan. The Buckeyes won the Western Conference and claimed their first-ever national title after finishing the season {{at the top of the}} AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{defeated}} both Democratic {{candidates in}} the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three <b>hand-picked</b> Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered {{on the brink of}} a possible civil war.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} AIF {{personnel}} also served in other theatres. Australian {{troops from the}} 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron provided communications for British forces during the Mesopotamian Campaign. They participated {{in a number of}} battles, including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army. A special force, known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Dunsterville, was formed from <b>hand-picked</b> British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and one party under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. Australian nurses staffed four British hospitals in Salonika, and another 10 in India.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{there were}} 92,000 Australian {{soldiers}} in France, 60,000 in England and 17,000 in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Small numbers were serving in other theatres.

5|$|Areobindus {{was murdered}} by Guntharic, but Artabanes secured {{guarantees}} of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic's service. In secret, however, he began planning to overthrow him. Soon after, Artabanes was entrusted, alongside John and Ulitheus, with an expedition against Antalas's Moors. He marched south, along with an allied Moorish contingent under Cutzinas. Antalas's men fled before him, but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back. According to Procopius, he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at Hadrumetum under Marcentius, but {{decided to return to}} Carthage and go on with his plan to assassinate Guntharic. Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time, confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends: even his Armenian unit of <b>hand-picked</b> and completely loyal veteran soldiers was not aware of it until the very last moment. Such a perfect concealment was achieved, not least thanks to the fact that during both planning and implementation stages of this assassination the communication between the exclusively Armenian conspirators was in their mother tongue, an incomprehensible language for other ethnic elements of the imperial army in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In August 1960, Clements {{met with}} Combs {{and told him}} he wanted to resign to work for the vice-presidential {{campaign}} of Lyndon Johnson. Combs called a press conference and announced that Clements' resignation would be effective September 1 and that he would be replaced by Henry Ward. The resignation {{was the end of the}} Clements faction of the state Democratic party. His split with Combs was so severe that he allied with his longtime foe, Happy Chandler, against the new Combs faction of the party. In the 1962 senatorial race, Clements opposed Wilson Wyatt's challenge to Senator Thruston Morton. Morton won re-election, ending Wyatt's political career. Chandler again sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1963. Clements appeared on stage with Chandler at a rally where Chandler claimed that Combs had arranged the truck deal to discredit Clements. Chandler hoped to damage Combs' reputation and, by extension, that of his <b>hand-picked</b> successor Edward T. Breathitt. His strategy was unsuccessful; Breathitt carried the primary and went on to win the general election. Clements' waning influence was evidenced by the fact that Breathitt carried Union County by a vote of 2,528 to 1,913.|$|E

25|$|Chamlong, {{strongly}} criticised for mishandling internal PDP {{politics in}} {{the last days of the}} Chuan-government, retired from politics and <b>hand-picked</b> Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.|$|E
25|$|Staged {{a second}} time in late 1988 at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, it lacked the cockeyed appeal of Theklas unusual setting, and the <b>hand-picked</b> Bristol cast and {{orchestra}} (for which much of the material was specifically crafted).|$|E
25|$|Surprised Democrats had {{expected}} Chief Justice Malone {{to win and}} did not run a serious candidate and only had a perennial gadfly nominee. Democrats quickly disqualified him and <b>hand-picked</b> Jefferson County Circuit Judge Bob Vance as his replacement.|$|E
