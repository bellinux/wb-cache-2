40|$|The {{formation}} of an oil drop from a single capillary in a continuous phase flowing perpendicular to the capillary opening has been studied numerically. The shear stress at the interface of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop,</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity inside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> and <b>the</b> pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> have been determined in {{a cross section of}} <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> formation area. <b>The</b> results show a maximum pressure in the continuous phase near the stagnation point and a maximum shear stress in both phases nearer the top of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> lowest pressures were found behind the top of <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> where <b>the</b> surrounding flow starts to separate from the interface of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> shear stress outside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> causes a drag which, together with the drag originated from the pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> promotes drop detachment...|$|R

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem <b>drops</b> <b>the</b> assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E

5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil <b>drops.</b> <b>The</b> paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
