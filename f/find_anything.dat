5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> {{suitable}} in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act, {{which created}} the National Register of Historic Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create review boards to function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer.

The Department of Conservation dispatched field surveyors to all Illinois counties to <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> that might qualify for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} of Dean O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death. However, Keith later informs Veronica that Nish’s alibi doesn’t check out for the Dean’s car {{but that it was}} likely true for Mindy’s car, putting her under suspicion.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, John Herbert and Arthur Clifford Price, having {{inherited}} the prosperous Price Brothers Limited after the 1924 {{death of their}} father, Sir William Price III, decided {{to build a new}} headquarters for the company in Quebec City. They did not <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> to their liking on Saint-Pierre street, at the time Quebec's main financial district, so decided on Saint-Anne street close to the City Hall. The design for the 16-floor building was awarded to Ross and Macdonald, a prestigious firm of architects based in Montreal.|$|E

The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} {{enough from}} {{the events of the}} previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only one there. She ventures upstairs to investigate; after failing to <b>find</b> <b>anything,</b> she accidentally fires her weapon, narrowly missing Peter. They bring Hughes in for questioning, and he refuses to give them a blood sample for their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E

5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house to <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> that {{might account for}} Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} of Drake's raid were significant to the Spanish. Rumors {{soon began to}} spread that the English had a settlement further north and were using the place {{as a base for}} piracy. This was confirmed by news from released Spanish prisoners that Drake had wanted to replenish the colony of Roanoke. Although the Spanish knew of Roanoke they could not find the English colony despite a number of military expeditions sent out. Menéndez came the closest reaching 37 degrees latitude but failed to <b>find</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{tensions}} {{between the two sides}} increased through the 1980s and 1990s as the house developed into a centre for radical left-wing activities.

The raid led to six arrests but since the police did not <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> illegal in the house they all were released without charges.|$|E

25|$|But {{his only}} signed {{pictures}} {{of this period}} are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It is difficult to <b>find</b> <b>anything</b> more coarse or misshapen than the Amphitrite, unless it is the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and Venus and Amor (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)—there is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type.|$|E
