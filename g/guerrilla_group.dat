5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group),</b> thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E

25|$|By 1974, another {{challenge}} to the state's authority and legitimacy {{had come from the}} 19th of April Movement (M-19), leading to a new phase in the conflict. The M-19 was a mostly urban <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group,</b> founded in response to an electoral fraud during the final National Front election of Misael Pastrana Borrero (1970–1974) and the forced removal of former president Gustavo Rojas Pinilla.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{large-scale}} operations {{proved to}} have little permanent effect on the guerrilla groups themselves, the reprisals instilled sufficient terror in the local population to deter cooperation with the guerrillas. Furthermore, in late 1943, pressed by both the Germans and rival leftist ELAS guerrillas, General Napoleon Zervas, the leader of EDES, the dominant <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group</b> in Epirus, reached a tacit agreement with Lanz and restricted his forces' operations against the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} Maoist model {{requires a}} strong, unified <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group</b> {{and a clear}} objective. However, some contemporary guerrilla warfare may not follow this template at all, and might encompass vicious ethnic strife, religious fervor, and numerous small, 'freelance' groups operating independently with little overarching structure. These patterns do not fit easily into neat phase-driven categories, or formal three-echelon structures (Main Force regulars, Regional fighters, part-time Guerrillas) as in the People's Wars of Asia.|$|E
25|$|Several guerrilla groups {{seeking to}} {{establish}} an independent Assamese state in northeast India have set up guerrilla bases in the forests of southern Bhutan, from which they launched cross-border attacks on targets in Assam. The largest <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group</b> was the ULFA (United Liberation Front of Asom). Negotiations aimed at removing them peacefully from these bases failed {{in the spring of}} 2003. Bhutan was {{faced with the prospect of}} having to strengthen its token army force to evict the guerrillas.|$|E

The arrest was carried out following a formal request by the U.S. government, which accuses Carvajal of ties to drug trafficking and to the FARC <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group.</b> On July 27, Carvajal was released after authorities decided he had diplomatic immunity, but was also considered persona non grata.|$|E
25|$|Colombia's {{government}} under president Andres Pastrana was undergoing peace {{negotiations with the}} largest <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group,</b> the FARC. but {{after four years of}} peace negotiations without cease fires, disapproval of Colombia's main parties grew. Violence was rampant. The FARC had, as they claimed, taken control of some 100 municipalities of Colombia out of 1093 at that moment, kidnappings were common and were {{among the highest in the}} world, as well as the assassination and crime rate. AUC was also gaining influence and expanding its massacres, and illicit drugs production, competing with FARC and ELN and other narcotraffickers.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{military}} intelligence units {{is not limited}} to gathering recon details, as it is further expanded to include an awareness of U.S. military training, as well as of its strategic plans and in general of many of the military aspects of the war in Colombia. FARC operatives that participate in these units usually are also intellectuals which can concentrate in studying military science, as another part of their service is to introduce newer weapons to the <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group.</b> The regular training given to all the FARC's commanders at certain ranks includes an overview of the new strategies and weapons found to be useful in the war.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group,</b> the Guevarist ERP, also {{opposed the}} Peronist right-wing. They started {{engaging}} in armed struggle, assaulting an important Army barracks in Azul, Buenos Aires Province on 19 January, {{and creating a}} foco (insurrection) in Tucumán, a historically underdeveloped province in Argentina's largely rural northwest. In May 1973 the ERP claimed to have extorted $1 million in goods from the Ford Motor Company, after murdering one executive and wounding another. Five months after the payment, the guerrillas killed another Ford executive and his three bodyguards. Only after Ford threatened to close down their operation in Argentina altogether, did Perón agree to have his army protect the plant.|$|E
25|$|Many Spanish escapees joined French Résistance groups; others formed {{their own}} {{autonomous}} groups which {{became known as}} the Spanish maquis. In April 1942, Spanish communists formed an organisation called the XIV Corps, an armed guerrilla movement of about 3,400 combatants by June 1944. Although the group first worked closely with the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), it re-formed as the Agrupación de Guerrilleros Españoles (Spanish <b>Guerrilla</b> <b>Group,</b> AGE) in May 1944. The name change was intended to convey the group's composition: Spanish soldiers ultimately advocating the fall of General Francisco Franco. After the German Army had been driven from France, the Spanish maquis refocused on Spain.|$|E
25|$|In December 1974, a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>group</b> {{affiliated}} with FSLN directed by Eduardo Contreras and Germán Pomares seized government hostages {{at a party}} in the house of the Minister of Agriculture in the Managua suburb Los Robles, among them several leading Nicaraguan officials and Somoza relatives. The siege was carefully timed to take place after the departure of the US ambassador from the gathering. At 10:50 pm, a group of 15 young guerrillas and their commanders, Pomares and Contreras, entered the house. They killed the Minister, who tried to shoot them, during the takeover. The guerrillas received US$2 million ransom, and had their official communiqué read over the radio and printed in the newspaper La Prensa.|$|E
50|$|By 1985, {{the major}} <b>guerrilla</b> <b>groups</b> (EPL, FARC-EP, M-19, and ELN) had come {{together}} under an umbrella organization {{known as the}} Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CNG).

While the CGSB did achieve some of its goals, its success was very limited. The CGSB's initiative led to the successful peace process with the M-19. The FARC-EP and ELN, on the other hand, decided to continue their struggle.|$|R
