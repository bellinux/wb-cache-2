5|$|In March 1826, a French-Canadian {{man named}} Methode, his Native American wife, and their {{children}} were gathering maple syrup in present-day Iowa, about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien, when they were murdered, apparently by a Ho-Chunk raiding party that had been passing through. The murderers evidently had no specific <b>grievance</b> with the victims, who were targets of opportunity. Two Ho-Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe turn over the murderers.|$|E

5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another <b>grievance</b> was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor.

5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary <b>grievance</b> was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|Between 135 BC and 71 BC {{there were}} three Servile Wars against the Roman state; the third, and most serious, may have {{involved}} the revolution of 120,000 to 150,000 slaves. Additionally, in 91 BC the Social War broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy, collectively known as the Socii, over the <b>grievance</b> that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Despite defeats such as the Battle of Fucine Lake, Roman troops defeated the Italian militias in decisive engagements, notably the Battle of Asculum. Although they lost militarily, the Socii achieved their objectives with the legal proclamations of the Lex Julia and Lex Plautia Papiria, which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical {{study of the}} administrative court of Saudi Arabia (Board of <b>Grievances).</b> Its aim is to evaluate the modem Board of <b>Grievances.</b> The study also investigates {{the nature of the}} Board of <b>Grievances,</b> that is, the extent to which its role is entirely administrative according to the Act of 1982, or also contains aspects of an appeal, review, or investigatory court. The study explores the legal nature and jurisdiction of the Board, the appointment, qualifications, and training of its members and processes for their removal or retirement, transfer, promotion, and discipline. It is argued that the Board's membership, jurisdiction and procedures all reflect historical, legal and constitutional factors; and that these influences affect the efficiency of the Board as a mechanism for the legal control of administration and of <b>grievances</b> against the government. The thesis seeks to identify major changes which would enhance the Board's role and strengthen its contribution {{to the rule of law}} in Saudi Arabia. The first part of the thesis consists of two chapters dealing with the historical, constitutional and legal framework within which the Board operates. Chapter 1 examines the law and constitutional background of Saudi Arabia. The main thrust of this chapter is to place the Board of <b>Grievances</b> within the constitutional and legal environment in which it operates, in other words within the history of the growth of the state itself. Chapter 2 examines the historical development of the Board of <b>Grievances</b> in Islam. The chapter also briefly compares the Islamic Board of <b>Grievances</b> with an institution that has interesting similarities, the Court of Chancery in English legal history. The four chapters of the second part examine the modern Board of <b>Grievances,</b> tracing its development since 1924, and its present jurisdiction, practice, and procedures. Chapter 3 discusses the modem development of the Board of <b>Grievances</b> in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this chapter is to explain the various stages of the development of the Board of <b>Grievances</b> as established in Saudi Arabia. Chapter 4 examines the composition and structure of the modern Board of <b>Grievances.</b> This chapter also discusses the status of the Board members as administrative judicial officers. Chapter 5 highlights the scope and limits of jurisdiction of the Board of. <b>Grievances.</b> Chapter 6 examines the rules of procedure of the Board of <b>Grievances</b> and its working practices. The concluding Chapter 7 refers to issues arising from the study in order to suggest some reforms necessary to improve the performance of the Board and to satisfy the expectation of the people.

5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term <b>grievance</b> for Pistrucci.|$|E
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main <b>grievance</b> was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary <b>grievance</b> being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E

5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. Many workers stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially expected {{to return to work}} on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. Nearly one-third of the African-American employees were non-union, and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were kept out of the stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-union African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main <b>grievance</b> against African Americans was that they were non-union and had been used by management as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
5|$|Turkey is {{a charter}} {{member of the}} UN, an early member of NATO, the IMF and the World Bank, and a {{founding}} member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's economy and diplomatic initiatives led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Turkey's current administration headed by president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has reversed many of the country's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey, such as Freedom of the Press, and a Legislative System of Checks and Balances. A set of standards for secularism in government, as first enacted by Atatürk have also diminished in favour of conservative religionist governance, to the <b>grievance</b> of much of the Turkish public.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's accomplishments as {{president}} included {{a resurgence of}} presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, energizing American naval power, and purging corruption in the Post Office, all during his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a <b>grievance.</b> The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E

40|$|The Treaty of Waitangi {{settlement}} process {{occupies a}} significant role in New Zealand. Though it aims to start the healing of historical <b>grievances,</b> the process has often created and deepened <b>grievances</b> because of its inability to respond to the dynamic relationships that exist between Māori. Over the course of several settlements, the Crown has demonstrated poor understandings of tikanga, the relationships between iwi and its own role in creating disputes and <b>grievances,</b> deepening the very wounds it wishes to heal. This paper reconceptualises the Crown’s obligations in order to respond to these concerns, focusing on the challenges presented where multiple iwi have interests in the same area of land (cross-claims). It argues that the Crown must act as an honest broker and facilitate the resolution of cross-claims.
