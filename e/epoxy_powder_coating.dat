50|$|Fusion bonded epoxy coating, {{also known}} as fusion-bond <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> and {{commonly}} referred to as FBE coating, is an epoxy-based powder coating that is widely used to protect steel pipe used in pipeline construction, concrete reinforcing bars (rebar) and {{on a wide variety of}} piping connections, valves etc. from corrosion. FBE coatings are thermoset polymer coatings. They come under the category of protective coatings in paints and coating nomenclature. The name fusion-bond epoxy is due to resin cross-linking and the application method, which is different from a conventional paint. The resin and hardener components in the dry powder FBE stock remain unreacted at normal storage conditions. At typical coating application temperatures, usually in the range of 180 to 250 C, the contents of the powder melt and transform to a liquid form. The liquid FBE film wets and flows onto the steel surface on which it is applied, and soon becomes a solid coating by chemical cross-linking, assisted by heat. This process is known as “fusion bonding”. The chemical cross-linking reaction taking place in this case is irreversible. Once the curing takes place, the coating cannot be returned to its original form by any means. Application of further heating will not “melt” the coating and thus it is known as a “thermoset” coating. The world's leading FBE manufacturers are Valspar, SolEpoxy (former Henkel/Dexter), KCC Corporation, Jotun Powder Coatings, Sherwin-Williams, 3M, Axalta Coating Systems, Akzo Nobel, BASF, Manifa Paints and Powder Coatings and Rohm & Haas.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens. When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections. Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens. Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux. The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours. In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light. Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum. An integrated pest management system is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} of several insulation options for such cooling plates. Different insulation systems were evaluated based on electrical, mechanical, ther­ mal, chemical and manufacturing properties as well as cost factors. Of these, the electri­ cal properties were experimentally examined. The core of the thesis was the experimental determination of the insulation resistance and dielectric breakdown voltage of different coating systems. These coatings can be grouped into anodization, a ceramic coating, polymer powder coatings, liquid paints and insulating films. The electrical tests performed showed that anodization, the ceramic coating, some powder coating systems and a coating process named e-coat do not suffice {{with regard to the}} two quantities under consideration. They experience a failure mech­ anisms referred to as dielectric breakdown. On the other hand, a number of insulating films, a silicon-based conformal coating and a 150 µm <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> system were found to be suitable for use on battery cooling plates. An approximate cost comparison of these final three coating methods was done to complete the project.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{correlation}} between the thermo-rheological properties of a thermosetting powder coating system with its surface structure build-up. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> systems, which displayed surface matting and surface wrinkling, were examined. Firstly, the evolution of the complex viscosity was correlated with the cure kinetic. Secondly, the structure build-up {{on the surface of the}} coatings was investigated with a combined SEM-CLA profilometry analysis at different stages of curing process for both EFB and CHDFB coating processes. Different finishes were found to characterize the films applied by using EFB and CHDFB coating processes as a result of the different way the film is heated by. Finally, a strict relationship of film morphology to the degree of conversion and to the evolution of the complex viscosity was found out for both EFB and CHDFB coating processes. The surface structure is built up after gelation point and continues to evolve after gelation with a full development of the film fine structure. Differences were observed in the surface structure build-up when different curing temperature was used, thereby indicating an influence of minimum viscosity on achievable finishing. These experimental results lead to further advances in a better understanding of the formation of surface topography and morphology of polymeric films. They also provide important indications for the settings of curing parameters in both EFB and CHDFB coating processes as well as for the development of new powder coating formulations. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> on the electrolytic {{galvanized steel sheet}} via electrostatic powder coating system. Normally, the film thickness and powder coverage of the coated powder is not optimum. It leads to non- protection of the parts from rusty and corrosion besides having many defects such as orange peel, rough surface, poor adhesion and inconsistencies of colour tone. In order to produce good coating quality, the processing parameters must be optimized. In this research, there have three variable parameters need to investigate. The variable parameters are total air volume, powder output and spraying distances. These parameters were screening to determine the significant effects to the coating quality. The screening result shows the spraying distance does not have significant effects and it was discarded. The experiments were carrying out to determine the optimum combination of powder output and total air volume. It is purposely to produce sample with good coating quality besides improved the first pass transfer efficiency (FPTE). All samples were tested using same processes that are pre-treatment, dry-off, powder spraying and curing. The method used to investigate the coating characteristic are thickness measurement, Buchholz indentation test, cross cut test, colour visual checking, particle cross-linking struture and surface profile analysis. The instruments {{used to evaluate the}} samples are coating thickness gauge, Buchholz indentor, multi blade cutting tools, spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and surface profiler. The experimental result shows the combination of 4. 0 m³/h of total air volume and 150 g/min of powder output produce good coated sample with optimum thickness and colour tone. It also has good particle crosslinking structure and surface profiler.

5000|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>Coating</b> {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is that the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a [...] "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts.

40|$|Powder {{coatings}} provide {{several advantages}} over traditional coatings: environmental friendliness, freedom of design, robustness and resistance of surfaces, possibility to seamlessly all-around coating, fast production process, cost-effectiveness. In {{the last years}} these benefits of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology have been adopted from metal to heat-sensitive natural fibre/ wood based substrates (especially medium density fibre boards- MDF) used for interior furniture applications. <b>Powder</b> <b>coated</b> MDF furniture parts are gaining market share already in the classic furniture applications kitchen, bathroom, living and offices. The acceptance of this product is increasing as reflected by excellent growth rates and an increasing customer base. Current efforts of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> industry to develop new powders with higher reactivity (i. e. lower curing temperatures and shorter curing times; e. g. 120 °C/ 5 min) will enable the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of other heat-sensitive substrates like natural fibre composites, wood plastic composites, light weight panels and different plastics in the future. The coating could be applied and cured by the conventional <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> process (electrostatic application, and melting and curing in an IR-oven) or by a new <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> procedure based on the in-mould-coating (IMC) technique which is already established in the plastic industry.
