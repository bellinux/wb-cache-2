2500|$|In 1999, a car {{accident}} with David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) leaves Erica's face disfigured. This storyline unintentionally mirrored a similar {{car accident}} Lucci was involved in, in 1966 which almost permanently scarred <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>Like</b> Erica, she needed plastic surgery. In the storyline, Erica and David fall in love while he helps her through her recovery. The obstacles designed to come between them are her continued feelings for Dimitri and his inability to fully give himself to a woman {{because of what happened}} to his father when he loved his mother too much. They become engaged to be married but Erica calls it off. She next falls in love with Chris Stamp (Jack Scalia). [...] "I really think that she found someone very special in Chris Stamp," [...] Lucci said. [...] "They are a pretty hot combination, and he seems strong and capable enough of being with her." [...] In the story, after becoming engaged to Chris, Erica cheats on him with Jack and Chris is killed. She and Jack marry in 2005. They form a family unit including all of their combined children. The union does not last, as they grow apart and Erica cheats on him with Jeff Martin.|$|E
60|$|The slight anxiety {{passed from}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a cloud. Her smile was {{positively}} brilliant.|$|E
60|$|A last {{gleam of}} her old energy flickered up in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> a dying flame.|$|E
6000|$|The woman nodded. [...] "And when I {{spoke about}} it and {{reminded}} 'er that she 'ad only just lost 'er pore husband, I thought she would ha' burst," [...] she said, severely. [...] "She sat down on that stair and laughed till the tears ran dowwn <b>'er</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> water." ...|$|R
60|$|Pauline rose {{suddenly}} to her feet. Her bosom was heaving, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> a white mask. Her hands were suddenly thrown high above her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{mountain}} showers don't last long," [...] {{the girl}} called back, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> shining <b>like</b> a rose. [...] "We'll get {{the sun in}} a few minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clear was {{the light}} of loveliness [...] That lit <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> rain; [...] And sad the mouth that uttered [...] Her immemorial strain.|$|E
60|$|Her rage got {{the better}} of her again, for a moment; but it passed over <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a spasm, and left her smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "'An' now'?' she sez, lookin' at him; an' the red paint stud lone on {{the white}} av <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a bull's-eye on a target.|$|E
60|$|The woman stared a moment; then a slow grin {{developed}} on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> so <b>like</b> to Haney's own that Bertha laughed. The lost sister was found.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> an open word [...] When {{brave men}} speak and choose, [...] The very colours {{of her coat}} [...] Were better than good news.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} {{clear as the}} sky, blue, empyrean, transcendent. They were dear, {{but they had no}} looking in them. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> a sun-worn stone.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} Maid lifted her helmet from her head, and so, uncovered, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> marble for whiteness, {{and her eyes}} shining like steel, made answer-- ...|$|E
60|$|Romola {{started from}} her seat. The colour {{had risen to}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a visible thought, and her hands trembled. In that moment her feeling towards Tito was forgotten.|$|E
60|$|They {{never turned}} away. She laid her hand upon her breast, murmuring the sacred name {{that had been}} read to her; and life passed from <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> light removed.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{feet like}} birds {{from far away}} [...] That linger and light in doubt; [...] And <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> a window [...] Where a manâ€™s first love looked out.|$|R
60|$|What had happened? He glanced back. Irene {{was very}} close to the architect, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> not <b>like</b> the <b>face</b> he knew of her. He hastened up to his son.|$|R
60|$|He {{was leaning}} forward {{watching}} <b>her,</b> his <b>face</b> intense <b>like</b> a spark.|$|R
60|$|Her way {{of smiling}} enchanted him. The smile always began far {{down in her}} eyes and flowed outward to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a {{sparkling}} brook stealing out of shadow into sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the little}} darling," [...] cried Miss Rosetta, all her old maidishness and oddity falling {{away from her}} like a garment, and all her innate and denied {{motherhood}} shining out in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a transforming illumination. [...] "Oh, the sweet, dear, pretty little thing!" ...|$|E
60|$|Once Electa boxed Christopher's ears. Eunice, who was {{knitting}} by the table, stood up. A {{resemblance to}} her mother, never before visible, {{came out in}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a brand. She lifted her hand and slapped Electa's cheek deliberately twice, leaving a dull red mark where she struck.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was radiant <b>like</b> gold, as she sat thinking.|$|R
6000|$|Gudruda {{turned and}} walked into the hall and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> the <b>face</b> of death. Men saw her, and Asmund asked why she wore so strange a mien. Then Gudruda sang this song: ...|$|R
60|$|Tell me {{not that}} any goes Safe by that enchanted place; Eros dwells with Anteros In {{the garden of}} <b>her</b> <b>Face,</b> Where <b>like</b> friends who late were foes Meet the white and crimson Rose.|$|R
60|$|Left {{alone with}} her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> one who was {{floating}} away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the stream. She put {{the shadow of a}} hand to her lips again, and recalled her.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when she}} looked at him, dumbly, half-guessing, half-understanding, apologizing perhaps, anyhow saying as he had said, [...] "It's none of my fault," [...] {{straight}} and beautiful in body, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a shell within its cap, then he knew that cloisters and classics are no use whatever. The problem is insoluble.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' said Hermione, lifting <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a rhapsodist, 'there CAN be no reason, no EXCUSE for education, {{except the}} joy and beauty of {{knowledge}} in itself.' She seemed to rumble and ruminate with subterranean thoughts for a minute, then she proceeded: 'Vocational education ISN'T education, it is the close of education.' ...|$|E
60|$|Felix and I couldn't {{keep our}} eyes off her. Crimson-cheeked, shining-eyed from <b>her</b> haste, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> a rose of youth. But when the Story Girl spoke, we forgot {{to look at}} Felicity.|$|R
60|$|And oh, {{it was so}} wonderful, she was dazed. The song ended, {{she stood}} with a dazed, happy <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> one just coming awake. And the fard on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> seemed <b>like</b> the old night-crust, the bad sleep. New and {{luminous}} she looked out. And she looked at Aaron with a proud smile.|$|R
60|$|She {{held them}} up before me, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> shining <b>like</b> {{the return of}} life, with a happy welcome; and my heart beat {{to see and hear}} her as of old it was wont to do.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{having given}} her word like a man, she and Ursula entered the frail craft, and pushed gently off. The two men stood {{watching}} them. Gudrun was paddling. She knew {{the men were}} watching her, and it made her slow and rather clumsy. The colour flew in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a flag.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him again, with the same supplication of {{powerful}} love, and that same transcendent, frightening light of triumph. In view of the delicate flame which {{seemed to come from}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a light, he was powerless. And yet he had never intended to love her. He had never intended. And something stubborn in him could not give way.|$|E
6000|$|Honeymoons, after all, are {{matters of}} conjecture, and what {{proportion}} of them contain disenchantments {{will never be}} known. Honora lay awake {{for a long time}} that night, and the poignant and ever recurring remembrance of her husband's remark sent the blood to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a flame. Would Peter, or George Hanbury, or any of the intimate friends of her childhood have said such a thing? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she failed to grasp the {{significance}} of my words. Then the color died slowly out of <b>her</b> cheeks. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> the <b>face</b> of an old woman. Fear had come suddenly, and she was haggard.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{hair was}} shining, and her brows were shining too; [...] <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> herself, <b>her</b> mouth {{pleasant}} and sweet. [...] She is the pride, and I {{give her the}} branch, [...] She is the shining flower of Ballylee.|$|R
60|$|A nice {{chance he}} would stand against {{the man who would}} tell <b>her</b> that <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>like</b> a fresh blush rose, that her hair was a {{wandering}} sunbeam imprisoned by her smiles, and her eyes like two evening stars.|$|R
