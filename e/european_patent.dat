25|$|The {{opposition}} procedure before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) is a post-grant, contentious, procedure intended to allow any <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|E
25|$|The same {{principles}} should constrain {{the composition of}} a Board of Appeal in opposition appeal proceedings vs. its composition in examination appeal proceedings in relation respectively to a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> and the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application {{that gave rise to}} that patent.|$|E
25|$|The {{filing of}} an {{international}} application results in an international search performed by a patent office, accompanied with a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application. An applicant may also request an international preliminary examination performed by a patent office. The PCT does not provide that the searches and examinations are to be performed by one central patent office, as the WIPO does not perform searches and examinations. In contrast, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC) places the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) in charge of performing searches and examinations for <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications.|$|E

50|$|The Agreement {{applies to}} <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> granted on or after 1 May 2008. The new {{language}} regime however already applied for Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom to <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> granted on or after 1 February 2008. Germany had some {{trouble with the}} implementation of the London Agreement. The original implementation bill was flawed due to miscalculations of the date of entry into force of the new translation requirements for <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> designating Germany. A new implementation bill was then published on 11 July 2008. The old translation requirements are no longer applicable in Germany retroactively as of 1 May 2008.|$|R

25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{opposition}} proceedings is to give opponents, such as competitors, the opportunity to challenge the validity of a granted <b>European</b> <b>patent.</b> Opponents may also challenge {{only some of the}} claims of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> (although this is in practice rather unusual), therefore limiting the framework of the opposition to the challenged claims.|$|E
25|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office {{estimated}} in 2005 {{that the average}} cost of obtaining a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around €32,000. Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.|$|E

50|$|On 14 April 2010, the Court of Appeal of Paris, France, issued 24 similar court decisions, holding that, since France has {{ratified}} the London Agreement, no translation in French {{needed to be}} filed at the French Patent Office (INPI) with respect of <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> maintained as amended after opposition proceedings, and that this applied also to <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> maintained as amended for which the original mention of grant has been published prior to the entry into force of the London Agreement. The French Court of Cassation upheld these decisions in November 2011.|$|R
50|$|Terso Solutions employs 48 people. The company holds 17 United States <b>patents,</b> 2 <b>European</b> <b>patents,</b> and 3 Japanese patents. Joe Pleshek {{has been}} CEO of Terso Solutions since 2008.|$|R

25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The notice of opposition to a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an opposition fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Bulletin. Opposition Divisions of the EPO are responsible for the examination of oppositions. The opposition procedure may involve multiple opponents. According to the EPO, a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> was once opposed by a record number of 27 opponents.|$|E
25|$|Forgent also {{possesses}} a similar patent {{granted by the}} <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office in 1994, though {{it is unclear how}} enforceable it is.|$|E
5000|$|The {{enforcement}} of <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> is therefore {{characterized by a}} fragmented system with [...] "variegated national approaches towards patent-related litigations and (...) the possibility of having opposite decisions (and hence outcome) in case of parallel litigations." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} joint patent designation-renewal {{behavior}} of the EPO patent applicants during 1978 to 1996, using both nonparametric technique and a parametric model. The <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> through the EPO are substantially more valuable than patents through the national route. Value distributions of the patents are highly skewed, {{and even more so}} for the value distributions of the EPO patent families. The value of patent rights increases with the economics size of the country and has a modestly increasing returns to scale. Model estimation also reveals significant institutional differences across different EPO member countries in patent protections and quantifies them. <b>European</b> <b>Patents,</b> Private Value of Patents, Patent Renewal, Patent Application...|$|R

25|$|The {{opposition}} has effect on all designated {{states in the}} <b>European</b> <b>patent.</b> Decisions by Opposition Divisions, like any other final decisions of first instance divisions, are appealable.|$|E
25|$|For instance, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO), {{acting as}} ISA and IPEA, is not {{be obliged to}} search, by virtue of Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT, or examine, by virtue of Article 34(4)(a)(i) PCT, any {{international}} application {{to the extent that}} the EPO considers that such application relates to subject matter which does not comply with the provisions of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention to such an extent that it is not possible to carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the claims. The EPO acting as ISA or IPEA in the PCT procedure is therefore not obliged to search or examine some PCT applications when not equipped to do so.|$|E
25|$|A Swiss patent {{application}} was filed on imanitib and various salts on in April 1992, {{which was then}} filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> offices issued patents listing Jürg Zimmermann as the inventor.|$|E

25|$|A <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> (EP1369126A1) in 2003 by Bork records {{a method}} used for {{prevention}} of cancers {{and for the}} curative treatment of cancers and precancers such as DNA-mismatch repair deficient (MMR) sporadic tumours and HNPCC associated tumours. The idea is to use immunotherapy with combinatorial mixtures of tumour-specific frameshift mutation-derived peptides to elicit a cytotoxic T-cell response specifically directed against tumour cells.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the {{academic}} and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting software patents for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the integer point method of linear programming. He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation.|$|E
5000|$|The Unified Patent Court {{agreement}} establishes several {{bases for}} the use of patented information without permission of the patent holder. These bases are applicable to <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> with and without unitary effect. The exceptions, given in Article 27, provide amongst others for: ...|$|R
50|$|The EPC {{provides}} {{however the}} possibility {{for a group of}} member states to allow <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> to have a unitary character also after grant. Until now, only Liechtenstein and Switzerland have opted to create a unified protection area (see Unitary patent (Switzerland and Liechtenstein)).|$|R
5000|$|In Switzerland, {{the court}} has {{exclusive}} jurisdiction {{with regard to the}} Swiss/Liechtenstein unitary patents, whether these unitary <b>patents</b> are <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> or [...] "national" [...] patents, in questions of validity and infringement disputes, preliminary measures and enforcement of decisions made under its exclusive jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|Otsuka's <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> EP0367141 {{which would}} have expired on 26 October 2009, was {{extended}} by a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) to 26 October 2014., The UK Intellectual Property Office decided on 4 March 2015 that the SPC could not be further extended by six months under Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. Even if the decision is successfully appealed, protection in Europe will not extend beyond 26 April 2015.|$|E
25|$|Software patents in Europe: According to the FSFE, {{software}} patents for Europe {{are currently}} being pushed forward actively by a lobby gathering around the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> office and the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents {{the interests of the}} largest US companies.
