5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. The original idea belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; {{the only part of the}} original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a trolleybus in order to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island has 80 {{kilometres}} of shoreline {{but only}} small {{parts of the}} shoreline are easily accessible. The island's perimeter is embodied by sharp cliff faces, making many of the island's beaches difficult to <b>get</b> <b>to.</b> <b>Some</b> of the easily accessible beaches include Flying Fish Cove (main beach), Lily Beach, Ethel Beach, and Isabel Beach, while the more difficult beaches to access include Greta Beach, Dolly Beach, Winifred Beach, Merrial Beach, and West White Beach, which all require a vehicle with four wheel drive and a difficult walk through dense rainforest.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> {{of the items}} and {{progress}} through the game, Bart must use equipment such as rockets and cherry-bombs, which are bought with coins that can be collected by getting rid of aliens. Bart {{is controlled by the}} player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels are familiar to fans of The Simpsons and some of the television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call to the bartender Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens do not want. The game also includes some minigames.|$|E

Anyhow, it's a cinch that I've got that open-air bed {{convention}} beat to a finish." ...|$|R

50|$|First {{version of}} Frontera {{operated}} in single process, {{as part of}} custom scheduler for Scrapy, using on-disk SQLite database to store link states and queue. It was able to crawl for days. After <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> noticeable volume of links it started to spend {{more and more time}} on SELECT queries, making crawl inefficient. This time Frontera is developed under DARPA's Memex program and included in its catalog of open source projects.|$|R

In such long voyages, men <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> knowledge of each other's temperament and disposition, and, of a sooth, I think well of both, in this Señor Pinzon." ...|$|E

[...] "The rains have brought the grass up, and as likely as not they may halt when they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> good {{pastures}} and wait till the others join them. It is not likely that all that gang came from one place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{had done}} the same," [...] Jack said. [...] "I have luckily got a {{sovereign}} in my pocket, for I was going to pay Joe Scales for those six light canvas trousers he made me. Well, three pounds between us is not bad; and I have got four or five shillings loose, which will do, I hope, until we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where we can change our gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what it is," [...] added Dave, {{and then}} went on quickly: [...] "We'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> these <b>to</b> <b>some</b> safe place and then make sure that they'll never be stolen again." ...|$|R

I expect he has got {{strongly}} posted, or he would have been wiped out long ago; that is what would happen to us if they were to make us out and spy our numbers afore we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where we and Harry's outfit can help each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The road to Fondi, {{which you}} are about to travel, is one of the places most noted for their exploits. It is {{overlooked}} from some distance by little hamlets, perched upon heights. From hence, the brigands, like hawks in their nests, keep on the watch for such travellers as are likely to afford either booty or ransom. The windings of the road enable them to see carriages long before they pass, so that they have time to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> advantageous lurking-place from whence to pounce upon their prey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, gentlemen, {{if one of}} {{you will}} take the ribbons we will be moving on. I will get up beside him, and I will trouble any {{of you who have}} got Colts to take your places up behind; there ain't no chance of another attack to-night, still, we may as well look out. Now, sir, if you will take your place inside we will take you on until we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where your arm can be looked to. You will hear from the {{directors}} of the bank as to this night's work." ...|$|E

6000|$|Hartley {{could listen}} no longer. The fate of Menie Gray, {{connected}} {{with such a}} man and such a woman, rushed on his fancy in the most horrid colours, and he was struggling through the throng to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where he might collect his ideas, and consider {{what could be done}} for her protection, when a black attendant touched his arm, {{and at the same time}} slipped a card into his hand. It bore, [...] "Miss Gray, Mrs. Montreville's, at the house of Ram Sing Cottah, in the Black Town." [...] On the reverse was written with a pencil, [...] "Eight in the morning." ...|$|E

'Spoken like a man,' said he; 'is there aught which I may do for thee in England? though, by the Mass, I {{may not be}} here {{very long}} myself, for, as I understand, I am to be {{entrusted}} with the command of an expedition that is fitting out against the Indians, who have ravaged the plantations of our settlers. It will be good to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> profitable employment, for such a war, without either fighting or plunder, I have never seen. I give you my word that I have scarce fingered silver {{since the beginning of}} it. I would not for the sacking of London go through with it again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must be moving, Nelly. Here are {{the marks}} where we {{scrambled}} {{up the bank}} last night. If the Indians take it into their heads to search the shore both ways, as likely enough they may do, they will be sure to see them. In the first place let us gather a stock of berries, {{and then we will}} get into the boat again and paddle along under this arcade of boughs till we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where we can land without leaving marks of our feet. If the Indians find the place where we landed here, they will suppose that we went off again before daylight." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{a portion}} of the Muslims from the various regions of India were trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Pakistan, <b>some</b> faced attacks from Hindu and Sikh groups, during their journeys, that {{involved}} snatching of money, and jewellery of their wives and daughters.|$|R

60|$|Roger laughed bitterly {{again and}} went out. It was sunset. There was no {{work to do}} that night except to milk the cows, and his little home boy could do that. He felt a glad freedom. He put his hand in his pocket to see if his beloved Wordsworth was there and then he took {{his way across the}} fields, under a sky of purple and amber, walking quickly despite his limp. He wanted to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> solitary place where he could forget Aunt Catherine and her abominable {{suggestions}} and escape into the world of dreams where he habitually lived and where he found the loveliness he had not found nor could hope to find in his real world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{should say}} that {{the first thing to}} do is to go up through the gorge above and see whether there is any place that could be better defended than this. If we find such a spot, of course we could move to it; if not, we shall have to settle whether to go up the gorge till we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> place where the mules can climb out of it, or stay here and fight it out. By camping on the stream at a point where it could not be forded, and making a breast-work with the bales, stones, and so on, I think we could {{certainly}} beat off any attack by daylight, but I admit that we should have no chance if they should make a rush during the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|So that Voltaire {{will have}} to languish: [...] "Wrong, yes;--and sick, nigh dead, your Majesty! Ah, could not one <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> Country Lodge near you, 'the MARQUISAT' for instance? Live silent there, and see your face sometimes?" [...] [In--OEuvres de Frederic--(xxii. 259-261, 263-266) are Four lamenting and repenting, wheedling and {{ultimately}} whining, LETTERS from Voltaire, none of them dated, which have much about [...] "my dreadful state of health," [...] my passion" [...] for reposing in that MARQUISAT," [...] &c.;--to one of which Four, or perhaps to the whole together, the above No. 2 of Friedrich {{seems to have been}} Answer.
