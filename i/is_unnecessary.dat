5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E

5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a {{multitude}} of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some life forms are {{more capable of}} suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering animals <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi {{was not only a}} source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E
40|$|In learning, a {{semantic}} or behavioral U-shape {{occurs when a}} learner first learns, then unlearns, and, finally, relearns, some target concept (on the way to success). Within the framework of Inductive Inference, previous results have shown, for example, that such U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary</b> for explanatory learning, but are necessary for behaviorally correct and non-trivial vacillatory learning. Herein we focus more on syntactic U-shapes. This paper introduces two general techniques and applies them especially to syntactic U-shapes in learning: one technique to show when they are necessary and one to show when they <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> The technique for the former is very general and applicable to a much wider range of learning criteria. It employs so-called self-learning classes of languages which are shown to characterize completely one criterion learning more than another. We apply these techniques to show that, for set-driven and partially set-driven learning, any kind of U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> Furthermore, we show that U-shapes <b>are</b> not <b>unnecessary</b> in a strong way for iterative learning, contrasting an earlier result by Case and Moelius that semantic U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary</b> for iterative learning...|$|R

5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it <b>is</b> <b>unnecessary</b> to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
