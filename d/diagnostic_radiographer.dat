40|$|In paediatrics, {{the risks}} {{associated}} with ionising radiation should be a major concern, due to children's higher susceptibility to radiation effects. Measure entrance skin dose (ESD) in chest and pelvis X-ray projections and compare the results with the 'European guidelines on quality criteria for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographer</b> images in paediatrics' in order to optimise radiological practice. ESD values were obtained using an ionisation chamber Diamentor M 4 KDK (PTW) in 429 children, who underwent chest X-ray or pelvis X-ray in a Computed Radiography system. In {{the first phase of the}} study, data were collected according to protocols used in the department; in a second phase different tube voltage values were used according to patient weight. A third phase was carried out, only for chest X-ray, using the exposure parameters of phase 2, plus activating lateral ionisation chamber. Three paediatric radiologists blindly assessed image quality of chest X-ray, using a validated assessment available in the 'European guidelines on quality criteria for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographer</b> images in paediatrics'. Considering all the patients submitted to chest X-ray, the average ESD was 0. 22, 0. 16 and 0. 08 mGy, for phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For pelvis X-ray, the average ESD decreased from 1. 18 mGy in phase 1 to 0. 78 mGy in phase 2. Dose optimisation was achieved.

Factors that were considered to contribute to job satisfaction and in turn result in organisational commitment are remuneration, workload, working conditions, professional support and career development. Background: Statistics indicate that there are more radiographers employed by the private sector in comparison to the public sector. This could affect the delivery of effective x-ray services within the public sector hospitals in Gauteng. The Gauteng province could be the one worst affected by the unequal distribution of radiographers, since the majority of private hospitals are situated within this province. Aim: The aim of the study is to determine the factors that contribute to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers</b> leaving the public sector to work for the private sector in Gauteng. Materials and methods: The study utilised a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design to ascertain the factors that contribute to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers</b> leaving the public sector. A self- developed questionnaire was hand delivered to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers</b> across 22 private hospitals within the Gauteng province.

Methods: This review utilises data from oral history interviews undertaken {{as part of a larger}} study documenting the oral history of the diagnostic radiography profession in the United Kingdom as recounted by 24 participants. Results: The results are presented as illustrative of various aspects of the role of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographer</b> including the initial choice of diagnostic radiography as a profession, the endemic use of particular terminology, the nature of the encounter in diagnostic radiography (including that of sectional imaging) and whether the role is really patient-centred. Conclusions: The article concludes by suggesting that distancing from the patient is mediated by the need for physical touch in order to position the patient for radiography and also makes the suggestion that those opting for diagnostic radiography as a career may do so because they want a profession which is more distanced from the patient and that, even where this is not the case initially, individuals are socialised into adopting the ‘feeling rules’ of the profession.

40|$|Purpose: The {{standards}} of performance of healthcare professionals are now well defined and used to determine health professional curricula. Empirical research evidence exists in medicine and nursing which explores how well these curricula prepare their students for clinical practice {{but not in the}} radiography profession. This research aims to determine how well prepared newly qualified radiographers were for clinical practice and to identify strengths and weaknesses in their preparedness to inform curriculum development. Methods: A postal questionnaire and semi-structured interview were used to obtain data from newly qualified diagnostic radiographers and their work-based supervisors. The questionnaire assessed graduate preparedness against a number of items drawn from published documents which define UK radiographic practice. Statistical analysis, using ANOVA and Wilcoxon, examined differences between the groups’ perception of preparedness. A sample of graduates and their work supervisors were interviewed to explore preparedness. Results: There were significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) between; the preparedness scores of the graduates and supervisors, with supervisors rating the graduates higher than the graduates themselves; subscales of teamwork (p ≤ 0. 05), personal attributes (p ≤ 0. 05) and digital skills (p ≤ 0. 01). No {{significant differences were found between}} graduates employed in their training hospital and those employed elsewhere. Interview data revealed perceived areas of graduate strength, weaknesses and areas for curriculum development. Suggestions for improvement to the methodology were identified for exploring preparedness in other health professional programmes.

(Radiography (Diagnostic)) In {{order to}} meet the needs of the country South African radiographers need to become multi skilled <b>radiographers.</b> Empowering <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers</b> with pattern {{recognition}} skills to enable them to comment on images could address the problem in many South African departments where a shortage of radiologists’ results in delayed reports or no reports to referring doctors. The research assessed the ability of qualified <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers</b> in two Gauteng Government Hospital’s to apply pattern recognition and provide a comment on a radiograph after training in musculoskeletal pattern recognition. The study employed a pre- and post-test model with an intervention which comprised training of radiographers in musculoskeletal pattern recognition. The post- test results showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of identifying abnormal images and the comments provided were more complete than before training. Thus the intervention was successful in improving the ability of the radiographers to recognize normal and abnormal images, however, the training would need to be more extensive for an accurate comment to be provided on musculoskeletal images...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} set out {{to develop}} one or more conceptual models of diagnostic radiography based on {{the ways in which}} clinical radiographers themselves viewed their skills. The report analyses the historical relationship between radiographers and radiologists and the limited attempts at theory development prior to this research. This context is set against selected literature from nursing metatheory. This comparison is made since radiography had in part developed from the nursing profession and the historical and gendered background of both professions may be seen to be similar. •The methodology is largely qualitative and the use of computers for qualitative data analysis is discussed in some detail. The data collection was completed in three major phases- a diagnostic phase; a theory development phase and an applications phase, utilising several brainstorming groups and two questionnaires as well as action research in the third phase. In the diagnostic (first) phase of the research categories representing parts of the radiographic process were derived. Two models (or theoretical frameworks) were developed and their various concepts were explored and refined. In the second phase of theory development the research was extended to develop a statement {{of the role of the}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographer</b> and several concepts from the model were explored. In the final phase, the concept of holism was explored together with the relevance of the models for the education of student radiographers. In the final sections of the report there is a detailed evaluation of the potential impact of the models including a reflexive analysis. The conclusions are that the models provide a valid conceptual representation of the radiographic process and philosophy and that they have a role to play in education of student radiographers...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} radiography {{curriculum and}} the process of its enactment are under researched in the United Kingdom. To date, there have been no published studies which have investigated the curriculum and the role of radiography educators from the multiple perspectives of radiography students, university radiography educators and clinical radiography educators, that is, a radiography education community. Accordingly, this study describes the perceptions and experiences of a radiography education community in relation to three research questions: 1. How does a radiography education community conceptualise the radiography knowledge and skills required of a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographer?</b> 2. How does a radiography education community conceptualise the role played by university based and clinically based radiography educators in helping the radiography student acquire radiography knowledge and skills? 3. How does the community in this study compare with Lave and Wenger’s theoretical constructs of a situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation and Communities of Practice (CoP) ? The epistemological foundation of the study is constructivism and the overarching methodology is a case study conducted within a single higher education institution and three of its associated clinical practice partner settings. The primary data collecting method comprised semi-structured interviews, supplemented by a critical review of germane literatures, government policy and the curriculum guidance provided by the relevant professional and statutory bodies. The theoretical framework in which the study is situated is based upon Lave and Wenger’s theories of situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation and communities of practice. The findings of the study reveal a radiography education community which is lacking any unifying pedagogic discourse. In particular, there is an absence of opportunities for cross-community working, especially in collaborative curriculum development {{and the process}} of its enactment. This is further compounded by the community’s narrow interpretation of what a curriculum should comprise. Currently there is a clear focus on knowledge content and curriculum as a product which fails to take into account praxis and the social context in which learning takes place. These findings have been summarised by a representation of the enacted curriculum as compared with the ‘ideological’ function of a radiography curriculum. Specific developments required of the curriculum include: (i) placing a greater emphasise on the vocational relevance of radiography knowledge; (ii) gaining a better understanding of tacit radiography knowledge; (iii) ensuring greater familiarity with the curriculum and (iv) enhancing the standard of clinical supervision. The radiography education community in this study evidences both convergence and divergence with Lave and Wenger’s theoretical constructs of situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation and community of practice. Within the context of radiography education the study also highlights the consequence of power relationships, the complexity of learning in and across multiple communities of practice and the importance of individual learner biographies, all of which are underdeveloped in Lave and Wenger’s theoretical discourse. These findings have been summarised in a proposed theoretical model for a radiography education community of practice. Three specific pedagogic and managerial inferences may be drawn from this study which will require staff development and consideration of how the diagnostic radiography programme is managed across the community. Firstly, context, process and praxis need to be carefully considered in the collaborative development, design and implementation of the curriculum. Secondly, the university and clinical educators need to reflect on their own learning and teaching skills by engaging more fully with pedagogy. Thirdly, communication across the radiography education community of practice must be improved...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Government {{initiatives}} {{such as the}} NHS Plan, the NHS Key Skills Framework and the NHS Career framework place communication at {{the centre}} of effective patient care, and role/career development. All advocate a patient-centred {{approach to dealing with}} patients, through open communication styles that encourage patients to become active participants in their care. Previous research, that has investigated communication in diagnostic radiography, demonstrated a preference for practitioner-centred, rather than patient-centred approaches to communication, however, there is little evidence to suggest why this should be the case or how a more patient-centred approach might be encouraged. The present study therefore sought to explore factors that influence communication in diagnostic radiography, with the view to understanding the barriers to patient-centred care. Method: Semi-structured group interviews took place with 12 radiographers, across two NHS trusts, with the aim of understanding their communication with patients and the factors that influence it. An open coding approach was used to analyse the data. Results: Four attitude categories were identified as influencing the communication used by <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiographers.</b> 1. Characteristics of the radiographer. 2. Characteristics of the patient. 3. The need to produce a diagnostic image. 4. The need to keep the department running.

Data was gathered from four students who participated in a focus group. This informed semi structured interviews with a further eight students who were interviewed prior to starting work and three times over the following twelve months. All the participants had undertaken a BSc (Hons) Diagnostic Radiography at the same higher education institution. Four main themes were generated from the data; experience, fitting in, identity and supporting the transition. A high proportion of clinical education, balanced with theoretical input had developed the participants to be autonomous, reflective practitioners. However, they did find it difficult when required to take responsibility for, and assess students. During the transition process their awareness of departmental culture increased as did their professional identity. The participants wanted tailored support and found that they could ask any colleagues for advice and support and found peer support useful. An excellent practice of organised scaffolding support was identified which can be adapted for use in different areas. This helped the participants build experience and confidence.

Extended semi-structured interviews with six participants (mean experience in diagnostic radiography = 3. 5 years) were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Findings highlight that participants’ recurrently-cited lack of confidence around their knowledge of dementia, and regular treatment of the condition as a ‘generic’ thing in practice, had sometimes damaged clinical interaction, particularly when the participant was feeling institutional time pressures. Education for new professionals was seen as lacking in both quantity and context-relevance, with implications for professional confidence and ethical practice.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} is the injection, ingestion or inhalation of a radiopharmaceutical {{for the purpose}} of diagnosis or therapy. It shares imaging synergies with both planar / general x-ray and to computed tomography (CT) in its acquisition methods.

Most of the respondents were audited on a regular basis with peer review being more prevalent than review by radiologist. Reporting radiographers were actively engaged in reporting related CPD with study days and activities in journals being more popular and e-learning the least preferred. The ability of reporting radiographers to undertake both reporting and image acquisition roles means they are a versatile workforce that has a positive impact on service delivery. Reporting radiographers are highly motivated to maintain their skills, develop their knowledge base and extend their role...|$|R
40|$|The {{operating}} theatre {{is an area}} {{of practice}} that newly qualified <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Radiographers</b> find challenging. Interprofessional education (IPE) and simulation are becoming widely used in healthcare education in order to prepare students for practice. Failures in interprofessional communication are well-documented with poor communication an established cause of medical error and negative health outcomes. Socio-historical issues like imbalances in power and status are particularly prevalent in the operating theatre environment, and add complications to interprofessional working. As part of an action research study to develop and pilot an interprofessional simulation experience for Operating Department Practitioner (ODP) and Diagnostic Radiography (DRAD) students. Diagnostic Radiography students took part in a simulation in the mock operating theatre on the university campus with an ODP student, ODP and Diagnostic Radiography lecturers. A purposive convenience sample of 48 second year Diagnostic Radiography students participated in the simulation. Following the simulation students were asked to evaluate the session using Padlet and later reflect on the impact of the experience on practice. The simulation was a positive experience. The timing and organisation of the simulation is important for the students {{to get the most out}} of the experience. There are benefits of being immersed in a high fidelity simulation and the realism plays a role in preparing students for real life experiences...|$|R
40|$|The aim: The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effect of occupational stress and organizational commitment on <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>radiographers</b> in rendering quality service. Background: In the past two years radiography staff turnover at the public and private health organizations has increased by 45 % and 50 %. Increased occupational stress and burnout are some of the main reasons for staff leaving the organization. Limited studies were found on occupational stress amongst <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>radiographers</b> and no studies could be found on organizational commitment amongst <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>radiographers</b> at the time of conducting the study. The link between organization health services and patient outcomes is rarely tested empirically. Materials and method: It was a descriptive correlational study. The sample comprised 123 radiographers who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: There was a 97 % response rate. Organization commitment was moderate towards a tendency of low. Sources of occupational stress, namely workload and role conflict were high, whilst social support and role ambiguity were low. Radiographers relied on problem-solving mechanisms to cope with stress. Therefore the level of occupational stress experienced was generally moderate, but with a slight tendency towards high. Discussion: There was a relationship between level and sources of occupational stress. No relationship was found between a low level of organizational commitment and a high level of occupational stress. A relationship was found between sources, levels of occupational stress and organizational commitment. Thus, the level of service delivery is affected by organizational commitment and occupational stress experienced by radiographers. Conclusion and recommendations: The overall context within which an organization functions has an effect on radiographers’ quality of working life and this directly impacts on the behaviour of the radiographer during a service encounter. Therefore, from an organizational perspective it is important to create a positive working environment for radiographers and to improve their quality of working life. The overall function of the organization would benefit were management to shift from an authorative to a participative style. Workload and role conflict could be reduced by having protocols in place to minimize the variation in standard of the quality of work done. Dissertation (MRad) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.
