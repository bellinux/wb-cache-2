50|$|With the {{geothermal}} plants situated at Hengill - an active volcanic area - emissions of H2S hydrogen sulfide and CO2 carbon dioxide are released naturally from the area. Harnessing the geothermal resources {{has increased the}} concentration levels of those emissions with {{the expansion of the}} Hellisheiði Plant in recent years. ON Power has worked to reduce those emissions by injecting H2S and CO2 back into the bedrock. The process dissolves H2S in condensate water and injects it back into the high temperature <b>geothermal</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Once injected, water-rock reactions taking place in the high temperature <b>geothermal</b> <b>reservoir</b> will mineralize the H2S. This method continues to be tested at industrial scale at the Hellisheiði Power Plant since early 2014.|$|E

30|$|Although coproduced and {{independent}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> {{seem to be}} very similar for modeling purposes, their initial states (and thus, model initialization methods) differ. This research demonstrates benefits of initializing numerical models as quiescent systems with a proper temperature distribution (quiescent period is a period during which the reservoir experiences no injection or production, and it might range from 100 to millions of years). The thermal profile of coproduced <b>geothermal</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> however, is distorted by oil and gas production, and initialization with the quiescent period would not provide the correct temperature distribution for a coproduced project. This study focuses on geopressured brines, and therefore, we assume no forced convection (due to injection or withdrawal of geofluid) prior to heat harvesting.|$|R

In addition, such downhole instruments need to be robust, chemically resistant and present a high level of accuracy. These requirements exceed even that of the aerospace and automotive industries. Mechanical instruments and observation of material processes, such as melting, corrosion and deformation have been used with success in the high temperature geothermal environment, but these methods can only be applied to a limited amount of physical parameters and lack the accuracy needed for proper analysis of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Hig...|$|R

Well-established methodologies such as Fourier analysis and comparison against analytical solutions are simply not applicable to nonlinear systems.
