5|$|The {{river is}} {{important}} for its dragonfly communities, with a strong population of Scarce Chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of White-legged <b>Damselfly.</b> Red-eyed <b>Damselfly</b> is also found. The river is also important for aquatic plants, including Loddon Pondweed.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's Odonata fauna {{is quite}} {{different}} from that of Britain, with many fewer breeding species, but one additional species not found in Britain, Irish <b>Damselfly</b> Coenagrion lunulatum – see List of Odonata species of Ireland for more information.|$|E
50|$|The photo to {{the right}} shows the mating embrace that <b>damselflies</b> exhibit. Please note {{that these are not}} dainty <b>damselflies,</b> {{they are more likely to}} be common blue <b>damselflies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Argiinae are a {{subfamily}} of <b>damselflies</b> in {{the family}} Coenagrionidae, the pond <b>damselflies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Synlestes is a genus of <b>damselflies</b> in {{the family}} Synlestidae.Species of Synlestes are very large <b>damselflies,</b> {{metallic}} green to dark bronze or black in colour with white, yellow or orange markings.Unlike many other <b>damselflies,</b> they spread their wings when resting. They are endemic to eastern Australia where they inhabit streams.|$|R
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas <b>damselfly</b> nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|The Itchen Navigation {{supports}} a rich flora and fauna, and one {{benefit of the}} 5-year grant-funded restoration project has been the regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document this. Annual reports on the populations of birds, bats, otters, water voles and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies have been produced, with occasional reports on other aspects, while the Environment Agency has produces fisheries reports. As part of the project, a number of engineering works {{have been carried out}} to stabilise the banks, and trees have been cut back {{to reduce the amount of}} shade and encourage the growth of marginal vegetation. In the case of the water vole survey, this has been concentrated on the sections where work has been carried out, whereas the butterfly, <b>damselfly</b> and dragonfly survey has tended to cover the whole navigation. Vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along the banks. The project has tried to avoid the installation of revetments, as the vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing the banks, but where a revetment is necessary to combat erosion, it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften the edge.|$|E
5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings {{are one of the}} few veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with the wings held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with the wings held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held in this way the wings fit neatly along the top of the abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families the wings are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) the wings are held in the typical <b>damselfly</b> resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the leading edge of the wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in the wings. Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
50|$|Griseargiolestes is a genus of <b>damselflies</b> in {{the family}} Megapodagrionidae.They are medium-sized, black and green {{metallic}} <b>damselflies</b> with pale markings, endemic to eastern Australia.|$|R
50|$|Austrosticta is a genus of <b>damselflies</b> {{belonging}} to the family Isostictidae.It is endemic to northern Australia.Species of Austrosticta are medium-sized <b>damselflies,</b> dull grey-brown in colour.|$|R
50|$|The Euphaeidae are {{a family}} of <b>damselflies</b> in the order Odonata {{sometimes}} called Epallaginidae. They {{are commonly known as}} gossamerwings. It is a small family of <b>damselflies</b> with around 70 species. They commonly occur in Old World tropics. They are large and mostly metallic-coloured. They look similar to species of <b>damselflies</b> in the family Calopterygidae.|$|R
25|$|In September 2015, a new <b>damselfly</b> {{species of}} the genus Heteragrion (Odonata : Zygoptera) from Brazil was named Heteragrion brianmayi in honour of him.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{molecular}} phylogenetic analysis {{confirmed that}} the African <b>damselfly</b> Coryphagrion grandis, previously often classified within Megapodagrionidae or in a monotypic family Coryphagrionidae, belonged within family Pseudostigmatidae, close to genus Mecistogaster, as was proposed already ten years before. This finding suggests that the family dates back to before {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam. Water plants include water forget-me-not, bogbean and purple loosestrife. Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of <b>damselfly</b> and dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|The Agriocnemidinae are a {{subfamily}} of the Coenagrionidae {{family of}} <b>damselflies.</b> <b>Damselflies</b> in this subfamily {{are very small}} in size. The five genera contain 63 species.|$|R
40|$|This is a male swamp spreadwing (Lestes vigilax) {{perched on}} a plant stem just inches above {{the surface of a}} pond. The spreadwings are {{somewhat}} atypical <b>damselflies.</b> They possess the relatively small bodies and slender tails of <b>damselflies</b> but they the hold their wings partially apart while at rest; most <b>damselflies</b> hold their wings together while at rest.

50|$|<b>Damselflies,</b> both nymphs and adults, are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predators {{including}} birds, fish, frogs, dragonflies, other <b>damselflies,</b> water spiders, water beetles, backswimmers and giant water bugs.|$|R
25|$|Another female {{tactic to}} counter {{coercion}} {{is to try}} to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males. Other species that practice mate avoidance are Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, a species of <b>damselfly,</b> who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} damselflies, the young—known as naiads, nymphs, or larvae—are carnivorous. The most {{ubiquitous}} prey {{in the tree}} holes they inhabit are mosquito larvae, but they will also feed on tadpoles, syrphid fly and chironomid fly larvae, and other odonate (dragonfly and <b>damselfly)</b> naiads. The three leaflike caudal lamellae {{at the end of}} the abdomen, which serve as gills, are broad and elaborately folded, an adaptation to intermittent low oxygen availability in its habitat. Each lamella has a conspicuous white spot, making Megaloprepus easy to distinguish from other tree-hole damselflies.|$|E
25|$|N. papillator is soft bodied, {{covered with}} small spines and has six legs. John C. Conroy {{examined}} 13 males and 43 females, and recorded mean male lengths of 0.46mm (range: 0.397-0.504mm) and mean female lengths of 0.563mm (range: 0.525-0.641mm); Ruth Marshall's original description differed slightly with {{males and females}} recorded as 0.6 and 0.78mm respectively. It has been recorded {{at a depth of}} 5 metres. Larvae of the Eastern forktail <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura verticalis), larvae of skimmer dragonflies in the genus Libellula and adult water mites of the genus Limnesia have all been observed predating N. papillator.|$|E
50|$|Archiargiolestes is a genus of <b>damselflies</b> in {{the family}} Megapodagrionidae.Species of Archiargiolestes are small, black {{metallic}} <b>damselflies</b> with pale markings, endemic to south-western Australia,where they inhabit swampy areas.|$|R
5000|$|Diphlebiidae is {{no longer}} {{recognised}} as a biological family.It was the name given to a small family of <b>damselflies,</b> the azure <b>damselflies,</b> with species in two genera: Diphlebia and Philoganga. [...] Diphlebia is found in Australia and Philoganga is found in Southeast Asia. They are large and thick-bodied <b>damselflies.</b> They rest with their wings spread out. The Diphlebiidae were also known as Philogangidae.|$|R
50|$|Eurysticta is a genus of <b>damselflies</b> {{belonging}} to the family Isostictidae.It is endemic to northern Australia.Species of Eurysticta are small to medium-sized <b>damselflies,</b> with a pale brown or bronze colouring.|$|R
25|$|Developments in the 20th {{century have}} {{produced}} a marked contrast between the environments {{in the east and}} west of the island. The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve. Canvey Wick is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{at the site of the}} abandoned and incomplete oil refinery. The foundations of the 100 hectare (0.4 sq mile) site were prepared in the 1970s by laying thousands of tonnes of silt dredged from the Thames; the abandoned and undisturbed area has flourished as a haven for around 1,300 species of wildlife, many of which are endangered or were thought to be extinct; including the shrill carder bee, the emerald <b>damselfly</b> and the weevil hunting wasp.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), <b>damselfly</b> (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|E

50|$|Odonates {{are found}} {{on all the}} continents except Antarctica. Although some species of {{dragonfly}} have wide distributions, <b>damselflies</b> tend to have smaller ranges. Most odonates breed in fresh-water; a few <b>damselflies</b> in the family Caenagrionidae breed in brackish water (and a single dragonfly species breeds in seawater). Dragonflies are more affected by pollution than are <b>damselflies.</b> The presence of odonates indicates that an ecosystem is of good quality.
