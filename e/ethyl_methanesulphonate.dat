The overall percentages of male recombination detected in the second test cross progenies, in the three sets of experiments, were statistically {{the same as those}} in {{the first test}} cross progenies. Thus the enhanced male recombination caused by physical stress (with or without <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate)</b> was transmitted to next generation. Non-reciprocal male recombination was observed in dp b but not in b cn region in both first and second test cross progenies. Three abnormalities, (i) production of wild-type flies in majority over dp b cn type, (ii) Non-Mendelian segregation at dp b and cn loci and (iii) sex-ratio differences for dp b cn and + b cn types observed in test cross progenies of F 1 males of Drosophila melanogaster were transmitted to next generation when induced with 0 · 75 % <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> but not when these abnormalities were induced with physical stress. The data suggest possible association of non-reciprocal male recombination, segregation distortion and sex-ratio imbalance in Drosophila melanogaster.

40|$|International {{audience}} Ectocarpus {{has emerged}} as a model organism for the brown algae and a broad range of genetic and genomic resources are being generated for this species. The aim of the work presented here was to evaluate two mutagenesis protocols based on ultraviolet irradiation and <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> treatment using genome resequencing to measure the number, type and distribution of mutations generated by the two methods. Ultraviolet irradiation generated a greater number of genetic lesions than <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> treatment, with more than 400 mutations being detected in the genome of the mutagenised individual. This study therefore confirms that the ultraviolet mutagenesis protocol is suitable for approaches that require a high density of mutations, such as saturation mutagenesis or Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} and spectrum of morphological and physiological muta-tions obtained in M 2 and M 3 generations after sunflower immature embryos treatment with <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS) have been studied. Immature 9 - 10 and 14 - 15 -day-old embryos of two genotypes {{were treated with}} EMS at the concentration of 0. 02 % for 16 hours. Thirty-three types of mutation were found, described, and classified into the following groups: chlorophyll defi-ciency (3 types), cotyledon mutation (1), leaf mutations (6), stem mutations (9), inflorescence mutations (11), seed mutation (1) and physiological mutations (2). Differences were observed between genotypes for the spectrum and fre-quency of mutation. Mutation frequency after immature embryo treatment in the M 2 generation did not exceed the amount of mutations in M 3. At the same time, some mutations such as sterility, leaf venation, and different shapes of leaf lamina were unique for the M 3 generation.

40|$|Survival and {{reversion}} to T 4 r+ of bacteriophage T 4 rII AP 72 {{after treatment}} with <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> at 37 degrees or 45 degrees C were studied {{in relation to}} the extent and mode of alkylation of purines in DNA of ethylated bacteriophage. A single-burst technique was used for reversion assay. Survival was lower at 45 degrees C than at 37 degrees C at a given extent of ethylation of bacteriophage DNA, confirming that events subsequent to ethylation, probably depurinations, are the main cause of decreased survival. Reversion was positively correlated (approximately linearly except at low extents at 37 degrees C) with ethylation of bacteriophage DNA, showing that ethylation itself causes mutation. Following the concept that reversion results from G-C leads to A-T transition at a single site (Krieg, 1963 a,b) and the suggestion that O 6 -alkylation of guanine generates the miscoding base (Loveless, 1969), it was calculated that about one-third of induced O 6 -ethylguanines at this site would miscode to induce mutation...|$|E

40|$|Cellulose-negative mutants of Acetobacter xylinum {{have been}} isolated. Chemical {{mutagenesis}} induced a high frequency of such mutants without significant cell killing. Cellulose synthesis could be activated phenotypically {{in the majority}} of the mutants by antibiotics that block RNA or protein synthesis. Therefore these mutations are not in the structural genes coding for the enzymes involved in cellulose synthesis, but their nature is not known. All of the spontaneous cellulose-negative mutants and the mutants induced by <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> or nitrous acid reverted when grown statically, but about 10 % of the nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants did not. Growth experiments with mixed cultures of the wild-type and cellulose-negative mutants were used to analyse the biological function of cellulose in A. xylinum. The cellulose-producing wild-type has a strong selective advantage compared with the cellulose-negative mutants when grown statically. This is in agreement with the hypothesis (Schramm & Hestrin, 1954) that cellulose enables the cells to reach the surface of the liquid medium, where the supply of oxygen is abundant. Cellulose-negative mutants may be enriched in shake flask cultures because of selective aggregation of cellulose-producing cells...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{some recent}} advances {{in the understanding of}} nitrate assimilation in the model legume Lotus japonicus. First, different types of experimental evidence are presented that emphasize the importance of the root in the nitrate-reducing assimilatory processes in this plant. Secondly, the main results from an <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> mutagenesis programme are presented. In this programme, chlorate-resistant and photorespiratory mutants were produced and characterized. The phenotype of one particular chlorate-resistant mutant suggested the importance of a low-affinity nitrate transport system for growth of L. japonicus plants under nitrate nutrition. The phenotype of photorespiratory mutants, affected in all forms of plastid glutamine synthetase in leaves, roots, and nodules, indicated that plastid glutamine synthetase was not required for primary nitrate assimilation nor for the symbiotic associations of the plant (nodulation, mycorrhization), provided photorespiration was suppressed. However, the phenotype of these mutants confirmed that plastid glutamine synthetase was required for the reassimilation of ammonium released by photorespiration. Finally, different aspects of the relationship between nitrate assimilation and osmotic stress in L. japonicus are also discussed, with specific reference to the biosynthesis of proline as an osmolyte...|$|E

Genetic analysis and expression studies indicated that the mutation corresponded to the structural gene of the Adh- 1 locus on chromosome 4. Homozygous Adh- 1 null mutants lacked ADH- 1 activity in both pollen and seeds. Using an antiserum directed against ADH from Arabidopsis thaliana, which cross-reacts with ADH- 1 and ADH- 2 proteins from tomato, no ADH- 1 protein was detected in seeds of the null mutant. Northern blot analysis showed that Adh- 1 mRNA was synthesized at wild-type levels in immature seeds of the null mutant, but dropped to 25 n mature seeds. Expression of the Adh- 2 gene on chromosome 6 was unaffected. The potential use of the Adh- 1 null mutant in selecting rare transposon insertion mutations in a cross with "mutable" Adh- 1 tomato lines is discussed...|$|E

Furthermore, novel mutants were identified that were insensitive to the AAL-toxins at the seedling stage but toxin-sensitive and susceptible to fungal infection at mature stages. No AAL-toxin-insensitive insertion mutants were identified following a transposon mutagenesis procedure. Molecular mechanisms involved in host defence against A. a. lycopersici are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Plasmids were {{constructed}} to investigate homologous mitotic recombination in Drosophila cells. Heteroalleles containing truncated but overlapping {{segments of the}} bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) were positioned either on separate plasmids or as direct repeats on the same chromosome. Recombination reconstituted a functional lacZgene leading to expression of LacZ+activity detectable by histochemical staining. High extrachromosomal recombination (ECR) frequencies between unlinked heteroalleles were observed upon transient co-transfection into Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 (S 2) cells. Stably transfected cells containing the lacZ heteroalleles linked on a chromosome exhibited intrachromosomal recombination (ICR) frequencies two orders of magnitude lower than ECR frequencies.

Recombination products were characterized by multiplex PCR analysis and unequal sister chromatid recombination was found as the predominant mechanism reconstituting the lacZ gene. To investigate recombination in vivo imaginal disc cells from transgenic larvae carrying the reporter gene on the X chromosome were isolated and stained for LacZ+ activity.

In the short-term, both compounds produced dose-related toxic damage followed by a regenerative hyperplasia of the urothelium. At any given dose-level, the effects of MMS were more severe than those of EMS. Two years after administration of multiple doses of 2. 5 mg MMS or 7. 5 mg EMS the majority of animals had dose-related simple urothelial hyperplasias with occasional mild dysplasia.

Here we perform phylogenetic comparison of IND genes in Arabidopsis and Brassica to identify conserved regulatory sequences that are responsible for specific expression at the valve margin. In addition we have taken a comparative development approach to demonstrate that the BraA. IND. a and BolC.

Wild-type Arabidopsis produces an outer replum composed of about six cell files at the medial region of the fruits, whereas Brassica fruits lack this tissue. A strong loss-of-function braA. ind. a mutant gained outer replum tissue in addition to its defect in valve margin development.

40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} of native crops {{is a new}} and promising strategy to combat hunger in the developing world. Tef is the major staple food crop for approximately 50 million people in Ethiopia. As an indigenous cereal, it is well adapted to diverse climatic and soil conditions; however, its productivity is extremely low mainly due to susceptibility to lodging. Tef has a tall and weak stem, liable to lodge (or fall over), which is aggravated by wind, rain, or application of nitrogen fertilizer. To circumvent this problem, the first semi-dwarf lodging-tolerant tef line, called kegne, was developed from an <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS) -mutagenized population. The response of kegne to microtubule-depolymerizing and -stabilizing drugs, as well as subsequent gene sequencing and segregation analysis, suggests that a defect in the Î±-Tubulin gene is functionally and genetically tightly linked to the kegne phenotype. In diploid species such as rice, homozygous mutations in Î±-Tubulin genes result in extreme dwarfism and weak stems. In the allotetraploid tef, only one homeologue is mutated, {{and the presence of}} the second intact Î±-Tubulin gene copy confers the agriculturally beneficial semi-dwarf and lodging-tolerant phenotype.

Both γ and EMS treatment exhibited {{a reduction in}} survival rate, number of adventitious shoots, fresh weight and dry weight (DW). The γ- rays doses at 10, 20 and 40 Gy induced mutation in Bacopa monnieri leaf explants and five lines were obtained with increased in the bacoside A content. The lines obtained are D 15 (40 Gy) which produced maximum amount of bacoside A (22. 567 mg g- 1 DW) followed by B 11 (10 Gy), C 18 (20 Gy), D 17 (40 Gy) and B 6 (10 Gy) lines which accumulated 21. 051, 19. 320, 17. 163 and 14. 133 mg g- 1 DW respectively compared with control (13. 750 mg g- 1 DW).

40|$|We {{used the}} {{alkaline}} protocol of the modified plant comet assay for rapid detection of DNA damage in potato plants exposed to low (50 mmol l- 1), moderate (100 mmol l- 1) and high (200 mmol l- 1) NaCl stress in hydroponic conditions. DNA damage was measured as {{the values of}} percentage of DNA in heads and tails, and tail length. After 12 h treatments of the rooted cuttings with NaCl, a dose response increase in DNA damage was evident both in leaves and roots although the first two doses {{were not significantly different}} in leaves. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> was used for the comparison of induced DNA damage. When H 2 O 2 and phenol levels were examined, a dose response accumulation of stress metabolites was evident in both plant parts although leaves accumulated to a lesser degree. Low and moderate NaCl stress have potential to create DNA damage and induced stress metabolites while high NaCl stress has devastating effects on both DNA damage and oxidative stress parameters. Correlations between parameters were also evaluated with correlation network analysis. Plants exposed to high level of NaCl stress did not recover from the effects of NaCl after 4 h recovery period in dH 2 O. We assume that recovery of plants from these stressful conditions depends on the level of DNA damages. Therefore, measuring DNA damage or recovery from damage would help us determine whether the organisms exposed to more than one stress factors would recover or not...|$|E

Bragg {{led to the}} {{isolation}} of three non-nodulating mutants: nod 49, nod 772 and nod 139, {{as well as the}} supernodulation mutant nts 382. Mutants nod 49 and nod 772 are allelic to the naturally-occurring mutation rj 1 while nod 139 is non-allelic and represents a newly found gene conditioning non-nodulation in soybean. Using the standard reciprocal wedge grafting technique it was shown earlier that non-nodulation in mutant nod 49 is root controlled and supernodulation in mutant nts 382 is shoot controlled. Non-nodulation in mutants nod 772 and nod 139 (the newly found non-nodulation gene in soybean) is also root controlled. In addition, scions of nts 382 failed to alter the nodulation phenotype when grafted onto stocks of the non-nodulating lines. Lateral roots developing from the scion of nts 382 and Bragg exhibited supernodulation and the wild-type pattern of nodulation, respectively, indicating that the lesion(s) conditioning non-nodulation only affect the root in a localized manner. Physiological studies conducted on the mutants indicate that they are not altered in the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon when grown on nitrate, and a study of their nitrogen contents indicate that the anomaly in the non-nodulation mutants is clearly specific for the nodulation process. This was confirmed by assaying nitrate reductase (NR) under a range of conditions; it was observed that the non-nodulation mutants expressed inducible NR and constitutive NR activity {{in a manner similar to}} the wild type...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are stable pollutants, {{which can}} be found in almost every {{compartment}} of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They are very lipophilic and therefore have the potency of accumulating in the fat stores of animals. The mechanisms by which PCBs exert their adverse effects are still unclear. It is known that PCBs induce some important biotransformation enzymes, but their mutagenic properties are still controversial. The DNA breakage and clastogenic potency of a planar PCB 77 (3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl) was determined in vivo in fish, using the single cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay and the micronucleus test, on erythrocytes of the brown trout exposed for 3, 9 and 14 days to initial PCB concentrations of 780 and 918 pg/ml, dissolved in the water, Blood was taken by a caudal puncture and the erythrocytes were either deposited in an agarose gel (0. 6 %) for the comet assay or smeared directly on slides for the micronucleus test. Five fish were studied per treatment and 50 and 2000 erythrocytes per concentration and per animal were analysed for the comet assay and the micronucleus test respectively. <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS) at a concentration of 25 mg/l water was used as a positive control.

40|$|A {{gradient}} reversed-phase high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method using a C 30 column was developed for the simultaneous determination of astaxanthin, astaxanthin monoesters and astaxanthin diesters in the green algae Chlorococcum sp., Chlorella zofingiensis, Haematococcus pluvialis and the mutant E 1, which {{was obtained from the}} mutagenesis of H. pluvialis by exposure to UV-irradiation and <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS) with subsequent screening using nicotine. The results showed that the contents of total astaxanthins including free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters ranged from 1. 4 to 30. 9 mg/g dry biomass in these green algae. The lower total astaxanthin levels (16 mg/g dry biomass) were found in the green alga H. pluvialis and its mutant E 1. It is notable that the mutant E 1 is found to have considerably higher amounts of total astaxanthin (30. 9 mg/g) as compared to the wild strain of H. pluvialis (16. 1 mg/g). This indicates that UV-irradiation and EMS compound mutagenesis with subsequent screening using nicotine is an effective method for breeding of a high-producing astaxanthin strain of H. pluvialis. In addition, the green alga C. zofingiensis had a remarkably higher percentage of astaxanthin diesters (76. 3 % of total astaxanthins) and a remarkably lower percentage of astaxanthin monoesters (18. 0 % of total astaxanthins) in comparison with H. pluvialis (35. 5 % for diesters and 60. 9 % for monoesters), the mutant E 1 (49. 1 % and 48. 1 %) and Chlorococcum sp.

40|$|Abstract Background Rice {{is both a}} {{food source}} for a {{majority}} of the world's population and an important model system. Available functional genomics resources include targeted insertion mutagenesis and transgenic tools. While these can be powerful, a non-transgenic, unbiased targeted mutagenesis method that can generate a range of allele types would add considerably to the analysis of the rice genome. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes), a general reverse genetic technique that combines traditional mutagenesis with high throughput methods for mutation discovery, is such a method. Results To apply TILLING to rice, we developed two mutagenized rice populations. One population was developed by treatment with the chemical mutagen <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS), and the other with a combination of sodium azide plus methyl-nitrosourea (Az-MNU). To find induced mutations, target regions of 0. 7 – 1. 5 kilobases were PCR amplified using gene specific primers labeled with fluorescent dyes. Heteroduplexes were formed through denaturation and annealing of PCR products, mismatches digested with a crude preparation of CEL I nuclease and cleaved fragments visualized using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In 10 target genes screened, we identified 27 nucleotide changes in the EMS-treated population and 30 in the Az-MNU population. Conclusion We estimate that the density of induced mutations is two- to threefold higher than previously reported rice populations (about 1 / 300 kb). By comparison to other plants used in public TILLING services, we conclude that the populations described here would be suitable for use in a large scale TILLING project. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to DNA damage, cells initiate a complex DNA-damage response (DDR) that includes mechanisms of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, {{or in the}} cases of irreparable damage, apoptosis. Although regulation of the DDR has been extensively studied at the level of post-translational modifications and transcription, less is known about the role played by translational regulation. The data presented in this study describes the translational response and genome-wide translational profiles of human cells exposed to the DNA-damaging agents, <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS) and ionising radiation (IR). Exposure of HeLa cells to EMS caused a 60 % decrease in global protein synthesis, mediated by phosphorylation of the a-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF 2), whereas IR modulated global protein synthesis through changes in 4 E-BP phosphorylation. Polysome profiling by cDNA micro array was used to identify on a genome-wide scale the differential translation of mRNAs following exposure to EMS or IR. Functional analysis of the data revealed translational regulation of distinct subsets of genes that, in the most part, were unique to EMS or IR exposure. An enrichment of genes involved in the ER stress response was identified following exposure to EMS, whereas genes involved in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were identified following exposure to IR. These data suggest that translation of distinct subsets of mRNAs may be necessary to initiate appropriate stress responses following exposure to different types of DNA-damaging agents, and in agreement with previous studies (powley et al., 2009) implicates translational control as an important mechanism of the DRR.

40|$|To {{investigate}} tissue-specific {{relations between}} DNA adducts and mutagenesis in vivo, λlacZ transgenic mice were treated i. p. with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and <b>ethyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (EMS). In liver, bone marrow, and brain DNA from mice sacrificed at several time points after treatment O 6 -ethylguanine (O 6 -EtG) and N 7 -ethylguanine (N 7 -EtG) levels were determined {{as well as}} the mutant frequency (MF) in lacZ. In liver DNA of ENU- and DEN-treated mice, the bulk of O 6 -EtG was removed at 3 days after treatment, while the MF continued to increase thereafter. This suggests that O 6 -EtG is not the major premutagenic lesion in the liver. Indeed, sequence analysis of mutants showed only 24 % GC → AT transitions, consistent with the O 6 -EtG lesion, and 28 % TA → AT transversions, expected from O 2 -ethylthymine. In bone marrow after ENU treatment, a maximum mutation induction occurred at 3 days post-treatment, of which 43 % were GC → AT mutations and 22 % were TA → AT mutations. This suggests that in bone marrow O 6 -EtG may be a major premutagenic lesion at the 3 -day time point. In liver and bone marrow, EMS treatment gave rise to a high level of N 7 -EtG and a low level of O 6 -EtG but no increase in MF. No adducts or mutation induction were observed in bone marrow of DEN-treated mice. No MF increase was observed in the brain of either ENU- or EMS-treated mice, although O 6 - and N 7 -adducts were present...|$|E
