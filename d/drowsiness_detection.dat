40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>drowsiness</b> on-line <b>detection</b> system for monitoring driver fatigue level under real driving conditions, {{based on the}} data of steering wheel angles (SWA) collected from sensors mounted on the steering lever. The proposed system ﬁrstly extracts approximate entropy (ApEn) featuresfromﬁxedslidingwindowsonreal-timesteeringwheelanglestimeseries. Afterthat, this system linearizes the ApEn features series through an adaptive piecewise linear ﬁtting using a given deviation. Then, the detection system calculates the warping distance between the linear features series of the sample data. Finally, this system uses the warping distance to determine the drowsiness state of the driver according to a designed binary decision classiﬁer. The experimental {{data were collected from}} 14. 68 h driving under real road conditions, including two fatigue levels: “wake” and “drowsy”. The results show that the proposed system is capable of working online with an average 78. 01 % accuracy, 29. 35 % false detections of the “awake” state, and 15. 15 % false detections of the “drowsy” state. The results also conﬁrm that the proposed method based on SWA signal is valuable for applications in preventing trafﬁc accidents caused by driver fatigue...|$|R
40|$|Driver hypovigilance, often {{caused by}} fatigue and/or drowsiness, {{receives}} increasing {{attention in the}} last years; especially after it became evident that hypovigilance is a {{one of the major}} factor causing traffic accidents. Monitoring and detecting driver hypovigilance could contribute significantly to improve road traffic safety. This paper proposes fast methods to identify drowsiness and fatigue using respectively microsleep and yawning detections. In this study, the proposed scheme begins by a face detection using local Successive Mean Quantization Transform (SMQT) features and split up Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW) classifier. After performing face detection, the novel approach for eye/mouth detection, based on Circular Hough Transform (CHT), is applied on eyes and mouth extracted regions.

40|$|The {{detection}} of spontaneous behavioral events like short episodes of unintentional sleep onset during driving, {{which are usually}} called microsleep events, still poses a challenge. The analysis of {{only a small number}} of signals seems to be useful to detect such events on a second-by-second basis. Here we present an experimental investigation of 22 young drivers in our real car driving simulation lab. The experimental design was chosen to raise many micro-sleep events. A framework for adaptive signal processing and subsequent discriminant analy-sis was applied. In addition to the common estimation of Power Spectral Densities, the recent-ly introduced method of Delay Vector Variance is utilized in order to get an estimate if the signal has undergone a modality change or not during the microsleep event under analysis. The fusion of the outcomes of both methods applied to three different types of signals, to the Electroencephalogram, the Electrooculogram and to Eyetracking signals, by modern methods of Computational Intelligence, namely the Support Vector Machine, leads to high classifica-tion accuracies with mean errors down to 9 % for all subjects. It turned out that such low errors are only achievable in a relatively small temporal window around the onset of micro-sleep. Their prediction is feasible but with much higher errors.

40|$|Abstract. A {{combination}} of linear and nonlinear methods for feature fusion is introduced {{and the performance}} of this methodology is illustrated on a real-world problem: the detection of sudden and non-anticipated lapses of attention in car drivers due to drowsiness. To achieve this, signals coming from heterogeneous sources are processed, namely the brain electric activity, variation in the pupil size, and eye and eyelid movements. For all the signals considered, the features are extracted both in the spectral domain and in state space. Linear features are obtained by the modified periodogram, whereas the nonlinear features are based on the recently introduced method of delay vector variance (DVV). The decision process based on such fused features is achieved by support vector machines (SVM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural networks. For the latter also methods of metrics adaptation in the input space are applied. The parameters of all utilized algorithms are optimized empirically in order to gain maximal classification accuracy. It is also shown that metrics adaptation by weighting the input features can improve the classification accuracy, but only to a limited extent. Limited improvements are also obtained when fusing features of selected signals, but highest improvements are gained by fusion of features of all available signals. In this case test errors are reduced down to 9 % in the mean, which clearly illustrates the potential of our methodology to establish a reference standard of <b>drowsiness</b> and microsleep <b>detection</b> devices for future online driver monitoring...|$|R
30|$|Several studies {{relevant}} to current article such as characteristic of driving, <b>drowsiness</b> and fatigue <b>detection</b> {{have been evaluated}} by researchers. For instance, Shang et al. addressed to the driving characteristics analyzing cognitive state inside the brain. They used a relatively new method of multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate the brain activation in a driving simulator by independently manipulating the cognitive demand. Left brain plays an initiative role, while right brain closely follows towards the activation degree of left brain, so they proved {{that there is a}} balanced tendency of symmetrical activation between left and right brain (Shang et al. 2007). Besides, Schier (2000) recorded EEG from four sites of scalp during both two-lap and replay driving tasks. Power spectra were computed to produce values of relative alpha activity and an increase was found in alpha activity as a result. Furthermore Chin-Teng et al. (2005 a) suggested a system that combines EEG power spectra estimation, independent component analysis (ICA) and fuzzy neural network models to estimate drivers’ cognitive state in a dynamic virtual reality based environment. Also a relationship between driver’s style and driver’s ERP response was investigated (Chin-Teng et al. 2006). Power spectrum of ICA components and correlation between them was analyzed and Drivers were classified to aggressive or gentle based on the observed ERP difference. In addition EEG dynamics were studied in response to distraction during driving by event simulation, including unexpected car deviations and mathematics equations. Changes of EEG power spectra were measured and used to evaluate the brain dynamics in time and frequency domains (Chin-Teng et al. 2008).|$|R

Physiological signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG) and nonphysiological signals such as steering wheel related parameters {{have been investigated}} for <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> in previous researches. EEG has been deemed as a reliable way to detect drowsiness; while the accuracy of using ECG or steering wheel related parameters for <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> is {{not as high as}} that of EEG’s but they have the advantages of low cost and non-intrusive. This work is devoted to find out the possibility to enhance the accuracy of <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> based on the ECG and steering wheel related parameters. The correlation between EEG and ECG parameters and the correlation between EEG and steering wheel parameters for <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> are analyzed. If strong correlation between them are found it is possible to use the ECG and steering wheel related parameters to represent the EEG parameters which means the accuracy of <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> based on ECG and steering wheel parameters can be improved. Several parameters were chosen for the correlation analysis, the EEG parameters are the alpha, beta and theta band power, the ECG parameters are heart rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters and a parameter derived from Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), and the steering wheel related parameters are four variables derived from steering wheel movement, all of these parameters are most commonly used parameters for driver <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> in the literature. The results of the analysis showed that neither the ECG parameters nor the steering wheel related parameters have strong correlation with EEG parameters.
