40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{that describes the}} recruitment and growth of ovarian follicles was fitted to data on ovulation rate and the measurements of plasma estradiol collected at times during the estrous cycle for individual gilts. The {{method of least squares}} was used to obtain estimates of the parameters of the {{mathematical model}}. The estimated model parameters were the maximum estradiol production for a follicle, development of each follicle after commitment, and a function describing the initial estradiol production of committed follicles. The estimated parameters for each pig were classified by estrogen receptor (ER) genotype (AA or BB) and analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. There were differences between genotypes (P < 0. 05) for the parameter that described the initial distribution of individual follicles at recruitment. Gilts with <b>ER</b> genotype <b>BB</b> recruited follicles that varied more in size but had fewer very small follicles, indicating that the ER gene affects the relative estradiol secretion of the follicles at commitment.

50|$|The Sox {{played their}} final road trip of the season: they lost {{three out of}} four against the Royals and won two out of four against the Indians. The Sox played their final homestand of the season: the Sox lost two out of three against the Royals and won two out of three against the Blue Jays. In the opener of that series against the Blue Jays, Dylan Axelrod picked up his first major league win, going 6 IP, 3 H, 0 <b>ER,</b> 2 <b>BB,</b> 6 K in a 4-3 Sox victory. After the opener against the Blue Jays, the manager Ozzie Guillén called it quits as the White Sox skipper and he will manage the Miami Marlins under his {{four-year}} contract starting next season. The pitching coach Don Cooper took over as manager for the final two games of the season. The Sox would go on to finish the month of September with an 11-17 record and a third-place finish at 79-83 overall, suffering their losing season in third consecutive odd-numbered years. With a road record of 43-38, it is the first team in franchise history to end the season with a losing overall record but a winning road record.|$|R
50|$|On August 3, the White Sox {{played a}} split doubleheader at Detroit Tigers, which the Sox won 12-2 in {{afternoon}} game and lost 7-1 in night game. The afternoon game was a made-up game from May 17. The next day, Edwin Jackson made his White Sox debut against his former teammate, {{in which he}} had 7.0 IP, 9 H, <b>ER,</b> <b>BB,</b> 6 K. Jackson took his first win with the White Sox since moving from Arizona against Armando Galarraga, whose perfect game was lost by the blown call by an umpire on June 2. Jackson threw a no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays in St. Petersburg on June 25. Also on the same day, Chris Sale, who was the White Sox's 13th overall pick in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, was added to the roster as a relief pitcher. Sale was the first 2010 draft pick to be added to an MLB roster. After that game, the Sox were 37-13 (.740) over their last 50 games since June 8, the best record in MLB during that span. On the next day, {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Paul Konerko singled and Mark Kotsay hit a two-run home run which made it a 4-1 Sox lead. But in the bottom of that frame, Ryan Raburn hit a game-tying three-run homer off of Bobby Jenks which tied the game at 4-4. Then in the top of the 11th, Mark Kotsay hit a two-run triple on which Brent Lillibridge and Andruw Jones scored which made it 6-4 Sox lead. In the bottom of the 11th with two outs, Ryan Raburn, who hit a game-tying three-run homer in the ninth, grounded out with men on first and second to end game for a White Sox victory. Sergio Santos got his first major league victory after he pitched two innings following Jenks, who blew his third save of the season. In that series, the White Sox took three out of four from the Tigers in Comerica Park, even though Tigers had one of the best home records in the American League. On August 9 against the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards, it is the first time this season that the White Sox pitcher (J. J. Putz) allow a walk-off home run (to Brian Roberts) and lost 3-out-of-4 in a series with two walk-off extra-inning losses under the Orioles' new manager Buck Showalter. The Sox got four walk-off losses since the All-Star break and wee then 2-4 in walk-off games that season. For the Orioles, they led the American League in walk-off wins at 9, including three under Showalter. From August 10 to 12, the Sox lost the series against the Twins and fell to second place in the AL Central, one game back. Also the Sox lost the series at home for the first time since June 4-6 against the Indians, snapping their seven straight home series wins. During the time between series losses at home, the Sox were 20-3 while the Sox swept four opponents. From August 17-19, the Sox played a series against the rival Twins at Target Field when the Sox were three games behind the first-place Twins prior to the first game. In the first game, the former White Sox teammate Jim Thome hit a walk-off two-run homer off of Matt Thornton in the tenth inning to down the White Sox 7-6. In the second game, the Twins beat the Sox again 7-6 with the final batter out. And then in the third game, the Sox blew out the Twins 11-0 to avoid a sweep. The Sox snapped the Twins 9-game home winning streak and they snapped their five-game losing streak at Target Field. On August 29, The White Sox hosted Frank Thomas day at U.S. Cellular Field against the New York Yankees. Thomas' jersey was retired that day, along with his face put up on the legendary wall in right-center field next to Billy Pierce on his left and Carlton Fisk on his right, and also right under 'The Catch' logo. On August 30 against the Indians in Cleveland, in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Sox blew a three-run lead to tie the game at 6 thanks to his fourth blown save by Jenks. Then in the top of the eleventh inning, the Sox scored four runs, all with two outs, including Brent Lillibridge's second home run of the season. The Sox took the victory 10-6. They were now 2-1 when they had given up a three-run lead in the ninth. Also on that same day, Chicago acquired Manny Ramírez off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers. The White Sox finished with a record of 14-15 in August and 0-5 in walk-off games.|$|E
40|$|Like most kinetic chains in {{athletic}} performance, the baseball pitching motion {{begins with the}} muscles of the legs and continues progressively through the torso, shoulders, and arms. Similarities are noted between the baseball pitching motion and the kinetic chain employed in agility tests that involve acceleration, deceleration, and change of direction measures of agility. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to determine pre-season agility in NCAA pitchers and to relate these measures to regular season pitching performance. Methods: NCAA Division II pitchers (n= 10, age 20. 2 ± 1. 9 yrs., weight 83. 8 ± 10. 3 kg, height 1. 85 ± 0. 48 m) volunteered as study subjects. A previously described laser-timed 60 -yd shuttle run (“JJ Shuttle”) provided average speeds for four contiguous agility segments (S 1, S 2, S 3, and S 4 of 10, 10, 20, and 20 yds., respectively), as well as Total Shuttle Run (TSR). Statistical measures obtained from regular season games (n= 48), including Runs (R), Hits (H), Earned Runs (<b>ER),</b> Base-on-Balls (<b>BB),</b> and Strikeouts (SO), each normalized for innings pitched, provided evidence of game pitching performance. Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient determined the relationship of average agility speeds to pitching performance. Results: Analysis identified significant correlations (p 3 ̆c. 05) between S 1, S 2, and TSR and normalized SO (r= 0. 77, r= 0. 73, and r= 0. 87, respectively); S 3 and S 4 were insignificant (r= 0. 42 and r= 0. 59, respectively). Additionally, a significant correlation (p 3 ̆c. 05) was identified between S 3 and BB (r= 0. 67). Conclusion: Results {{of this study suggest that}} better agility may lead to selected improvements in game performance in NCAA Division II baseball pitchers...|$|R
40|$|Low {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) {{is a major}} risk factor for {{development}} of osteoporosis; increasing evidence suggests that attainment and maintenance of peak bone mass as well as bone turnover and bone loss have strong genetic determinants. We examined the association of BMD levels and their change over a 3 -year period, and polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor (ER), vitamin D receptor (VDR), type I collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin genes in pre-and perimenopausal women {{who were part of}} the Michigan Bone Health Study, a population-based longitudinal study of BMD. Body composition measurements, reproductive hormone profiles, bone-related serum protein measurements, and life-style characteristics were also available on each woman. Based on evaluation of women, ER genotypes (identified by PvuII [rr = 253] and XbaI [n = 248]) were significantly predictive of both lumbar spine (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and total body BMD level, but not their change over the 3 -year period examined. The VDR BsmI restriction fragment length polymorphism was not associated with baseline BMD, change in BMD over time, or any of the bone-related serum and body composition measurements in the 372 women in whom it was evaluated. Likewise, none of the other polymorphic markers was associated with BMD measurements. However, we identified a significant gene x gene interaction effect (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) for the VDR locus and PvuII (p 3 ̆c 0. 005) and XbaI (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) polymorphisms, which impacted BMD levels. Women who had the (-/-) PvuII <b>ER</b> and <b>bb</b> VDR genotype combination had a very high average BMD, while individuals with the (-/-) PvuII ER and BE VDR genotype had significantly lower BMD levels. This contrast was not explained by differences in serum levels of osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, or 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D. These data suggest that genetic variation at the ER locus, singly and in relation to the vitamin D receptor gene, influences attainment and maintenance of peak bone mass in younger women, which in turn may render some individuals more susceptible to osteoporosis than others...|$|R
