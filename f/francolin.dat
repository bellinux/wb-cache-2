40|$|Method to Capture Double-spurred <b>Francolins</b> (<b>Francolins</b> bicalcaratus Linnaeus, 1766) by Using a Net. A {{method to}} capture living and unharmed {{injuries}} double- spurred <b>francolins</b> (Francolinus bicalcaratus) is described. It consists of installing nets on a vegetation {{in which the}} signs of presence of <b>francolins</b> have been observed. Then, a beat is organized to orientate <b>francolins</b> in the nets direction. <b>Francolins</b> that are get in the nets cannot free themselves and have been recuperate by hunters.

5|$|The Djibouti <b>francolin</b> {{has been}} {{featured}} on two stamps: one in 1989 from Djibouti, and another from the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, {{which was what}} Djibouti was known as under French rule, in 1972.|$|E
5|$|There are 670 {{bird species}} in Rwanda, with {{variation}} between {{the east and}} the west. Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species, of which 26 are endemic to the Albertine Rift; endemic species include the Ruwenzori turaco and handsome <b>francolin.</b> Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, features savanna birds such as the black-headed gonolek and those associated with swamps and lakes, including storks and cranes.|$|E
5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the <b>francolin</b> are dying, {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E
40|$|Birds are {{hosts of}} the {{immature}} stages of several ixodid tick species (Theiler 1962) and consequent-ly {{could serve as}} a source of subsequent adult tick infestation for other hosts. This is particularly so for migrating birds (Hoogstraal, Kaiser, Traylor, Gaber & Guindy 1961), or species such as helmeted guinea-fowls, Numida meleagris, that on occasion can har-bour large numbers of immature ticks (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak, Spickett, Braack & Williams 1991). Two species of guineafowls and several spe-cies of <b>francolins</b> occur in South Africa and of these the ixodid tick burdens of helmeted guineafowls, Cape <b>francolins,</b> Francolinus capensis, and grey-wing <b>francolins,</b> Francolinus africanus, have been determined (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak et al. 1991; Horak & Boomker 1998). Similar data for crested <b>francolins,</b> Francolinus sephaena, or crest-ed guineafowls, Guttera pucherani, both of which occur in the northern and north-eastern regions of South Africa, have not been collected. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether crested <b>francolins,</b> which prefer thick cover and matted vegetation, play the same role as hel-meted guineafowls, which prefer thorny scrub and savanna veld, as hosts for the immature stages of ticks of veterinary importance.

5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entr√©es for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, <b>francolin,</b> quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E

40|$|The {{crop and}} gizzard {{contents}} of 105 Double-spurred <b>Francolins</b> (Francolinus bicalcaratus Linnaeus) {{shot in the}} wild by hunters in Zaria and its environs were examined. Thirty food-organisms (i. e., species or other taxa that served as food for the <b>francolins)</b> were isolated from the gut content of the birds. Brachiaria stigmatisata and Vigna ambacensis were the most frequent food-organisms, having {{been found in the}} guts of 64 (60. 95 %) of the birds. In {{terms of the number of}} individual food items consumed by the birds, Setaria pallide-fusca scored the highest with 9. 873 (22. 72 %) of the isolated food items. Gravimetrically, Sorghum bicolor was the most significant food-organism, accounting for 27. 50 % of the bulk of food items consumed.

500|$|The {{distinctness}} of {{this species}} {{has been described as}} weak by some authors, [...] although its status as a full species has been maintained.

500|$|This <b>francolin</b> prefers dense African juniper {{woodland}} with {{a closed}} canopy between [...] in elevation, and preferably on a plateau.

This <b>francolin</b> {{has been found}} in secondary woodland, box-tree woodlands (Buxus hildebrandtii), and acacia woodland (Acacia seyal). It is also known to venture into more open woodland and wadis following the breeding season. Much of the bird's African juniper forest habitat [...] has been damaged or destroyed due to human usage; the ability of this dead woodland to support the Djibouti <b>francolin</b> remains unknown, although some juveniles have been seen in it. It is believed that the birds are reacting to the destruction of their juniper habitat by trying to find habitat as close to it as possible.
