5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of when to apply microwaves <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> of porous media has created much interest {{over the past decade}} and still remains largely unanswered. To assist with the elucidation of this question, a model for <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> process has been constructed in which the dielectric properties are dependant on moisture and temperature. The complexity and cost involved in measuring the distribution of such quantities as moisture content, temperature, pressure, and power generated during a combined microwave/convective <b>drying</b> experiment highlight <b>the</b> need for mathematical modelling as an essential ingredient in the research of the topic. Numerical simulations can aid in the design and understanding of dryers and can indicate the effectiveness of <b>the</b> microwave energy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> process. <b>The</b> developed mathematical model can demonstrate not only the effects of the different functional relationships for the dielectric properties on <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> kinetics, but more importantly help in the decision of when to apply microwaves <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> process.

5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
