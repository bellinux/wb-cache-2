5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were {{broken by a}} sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.|$|E
5|$|In 1695, a {{three-way}} {{invasion of the}} Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo itself. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle.|$|E

5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita {{was sent}} to a {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path. Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, Moore {{signed a}} record deal with The Firm, a record label run by EMI. The singer's fifth studio album, Wild Hope, was {{released}} in June 2007. A departure from her previous style, Moore incorporated folk and acoustic music into the album. The album peaked at number thirty on the Billboard 200 chart {{and went on to}} sell about 109,000 copies in the US. In May 2009, Moore's sixth studio album, Amanda Leigh, was released through Storefront Recordings. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> musical style as Wild Hope, the album's title was taken from Moore's full name. It debuted at number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 and has sold 16,000 copies in the US, as of June 2009. The singles from Wild Hope and Amanda Leigh were commercially unsuccessful and failed to chart.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{of traffic}} {{patterns}} on Bømlo were undertaken by Hordaland Public Roads Administration in 1984. Based {{on it and}} other feedback, the agency stated that it preferred a pontoon bridge between Foldrøyholmen and Sørstokken, north of the ferry between Bømlo and Stord. It was estimated to cost NOK190 million, in addition to auxiliary roads for NOK40 million. In 1982, plans were launched for a fixed link to the mainland further south, which would include a bridge over Digernessundet, a causeway and low bridge across Spissøysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet. In addition, a tunnel {{would have to be}} built from Føyno to Sveio. This proposal was similar to the finalized Triangle Link. In 1985, an all-tunnel proposal, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route, was proposed. Hordaland Public Roads Administration stated that the proposals were unrealistic. The limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS (SBT) was founded in October 1986 by the municipalities of Bømlo, Stord, Fitjar and Sveio, Hordaland County Municipality and five banks.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} moving oil {{off of a}} tanker is similar to loading, but has some key differences. The {{first step in the}} {{operation}} is <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pretransfer procedures as used in loading. When the transfer begins, it is the ship's cargo pumps that are used to move the product ashore. As in loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure. Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation. While pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored. Under the direction of the person in charge, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Terang Boelan {{led to an}} {{increase}} in film production in the colony, many of the films <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> formula, including songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Before Terang Boelan, local studios had generally been unsuccessful in finding a formula popular with audiences, but the triple successes of Terang Boelan, Fatima, and Alang-Alang (Grass, 1939) revived the industry. Four new production houses were established in 1940, and actors and actresses previously attached to theatrical troupes entered the film industry, which was reaching new audiences. Most locally produced films released in the Indies were made between 1939 and the Japanese occupation in 1942. Meanwhile, in Malaya, the brothers Run Run and Runme Shaw, drawing inspiration from Terang Boelan and Alang-Alang success with Malay audiences, established Malay Film Productions in Singapore, where it became one of the more successful production houses.|$|E

5|$|The tour's {{production}} and staging {{consisted of a}} 60 foot tall rotating LED cuboid {{referred to as the}} 'Monolith', a treadmill runway and a secondary stage that stores and produces 2,000 gallons of water. The theme of the tour was described as <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album Lemonade, with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing a new chapter of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's {{production and}} Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener DJ Khaled on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, Parkwood Entertainment, such as the duo CHLOE X HALLE, who were relatively unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|While Mary Celeste {{prepared}} to sail, another brigantine, the Canadian , lay in nearby Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Her captain, David Morehouse, {{and his first}} mate Oliver Deveau, were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, {{it is likely that}} Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before Mary Celestes departure, dined together, but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. Dei Gratia departed for Gibraltar on November 15, eight days after Mary Celeste, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general route.|$|E

Sword of Mana was produced by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and largely developed by employees of Brownie Brown who had previously worked on the series for Square.|$|E
