5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal <b>interproximal</b> contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presentation}} of caries is highly variable. [...] However, {{the risk factors}} and stages of development are similar. [...] Initially, it may appear as a small chalky area (smooth surface caries), which may eventually develop into a large cavitation. [...] Sometimes caries may be directly visible. [...] However other methods of detection such as X-rays are used for less visible areas of teeth and to judge the extent of destruction. Lasers for detecting caries allow detection without ionizing radiation and are now used for detection of <b>interproximal</b> decay (between the teeth).

2500|$|A {{computer}} {{graphic representation}} of the projected teeth movements, [...] created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient [...] for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD-CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a photo-sensitive liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called <b>interproximal</b> reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|E
2500|$|The mouth {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of oral bacteria, but only a few specific species of bacteria are believed to cause dental caries: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species among them. Streptococcus mutans are gram-positive bacteria which constitute biofilms on the surface of teeth. These organisms can produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties essential for cariogenic bacteria. [...] As the cementum of root surfaces is more easily demineralized than enamel surfaces, a wider variety of bacteria can cause root caries, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces spp., Nocardia spp., and Streptococcus mutans. [...] Bacteria collect around the teeth and gums in a sticky, creamy-coloured mass called plaque, which serves as a biofilm. Some sites collect plaque more commonly than others, for example, sites with a low rate of salivary flow (molar fissures). [...] Grooves on the occlusal surfaces of molar and premolar teeth provide microscopic retention sites for plaque bacteria, as do the <b>interproximal</b> sites. Plaque may also collect above or below the gingiva, where it is referred to as supra- or sub-gingival plaque, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Interproximal</b> {{reduction}} (IPR) (also called <b>interproximal</b> enamel reduction, slenderizing, air rotor stripping (ARS) or reproximation) is {{the practice}} of mechanically removing enamel from between the teeth to achieve orthodontic ends, such as to correct crowding, or reshape the contact area between neighboring teeth.|$|E

50|$|A missing papilla {{is often}} visible {{as a small}} {{triangular}} gap between adjacent teeth. The relationship of interdental bone to the <b>interproximal</b> contact point between adjacent teeth is a determining factor in whether the interdental papilla will be present. If greater than 8mm exist between the interdental bone and the <b>interproximal</b> contact, usually no papilla will be present. If the distance is 5mm or less, than a papilla will almost always be present.|$|E

50|$|Contact with {{adjacent}} {{teeth in}} the same arch {{is referred to as}} <b>interproximal</b> contacts. The maxillary central incisors are one of only two types of teeth which has an <b>interproximal</b> contact with itself. The other type of teeth is the mandibular central incisors. In usually preferred and healthy states, the central incisors touch in the incisal third of the teeth. On the other hand, the contact between the central incisor and the lateral incisor is nearer the gingiva at the location between the incisal and middle thirds of the tooth's crown.|$|E

The next version of the V-Ring was the V3, introduced in 2008. Among other adjustments, this ring used glass fiber reinforced plastic to replace the V-Ring’s stainless steel tines.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{periodontal}} pocketing requires {{professional and}} at home intervention. At home treatment for periodontal pockets include meticulous and routine plaque removal by brushing and <b>interproximal</b> cleaning. Professional treatment includes routine dental visits for debridement, scaling and root planing. Clinical treatment goals are set to control the inflammatory disease by removal of coronal and subgingival plaque containing destructive pathogens. With the consistent and complete removal of biofilm, the infection can be arrested and healthy periodontium can be achieved.|$|E

50|$|Embrasures are triangularly shaped spaces {{located between}} the {{proximal}} surfaces of adjacent teeth. The borders of embrasures are {{formed by the}} interdental papilla of the gingiva, the adjacent teeth, and the contact point where the two teeth meet. There are four embrasures for every contact area: facial (also called labial or buccal), lingual (or palatal), occlusal or incisal, and cervical or <b>interproximal</b> space. The cervical embrasure usually is filled by the interdental papilla from the gingiva; {{in the absence of}} adequate gingival tissue a black angle, or Angularis Nigra is visible.|$|E
50|$|Abrasion is loss of tooth {{substance}} {{caused by}} physical means other than teeth. The term {{is derived from}} the Latin verb abrasum, which means ‘to scrape off’. It tends to present as rounded ditching around the cervical margins of teeth, commonly described as ‘shallow’, concave or wedge shaped notches. Causative factors have been linked to this condition and include vigorous, horizontal tooth brushing, using toothpaste with a too high RDA value, pipe smoking or nail biting. It has also been shown that improper use of dental floss or Toothpicks can lead to wear on the <b>interproximal</b> (in-between) surfaces of the teeth.|$|E

50|$|The col {{varies in}} depth and width, {{depending}} on the expanse of the contacting tooth surfaces. The epithelium covering the col consists of the marginal gum of the adjacent teeth, except that it is nonkeratinized. It is mainly present in the broad interdental gingiva of the posterior teeth, and generally is not present with those <b>interproximal</b> tissue associated with anterior teeth because the latter tissue is narrower. In the absence of contact between adjacent teeth, the attached gum extends uninterrupted from the facial to the lingual aspect. The col may be important {{in the formation of}} periodontal disease but is visible clinically only when teeth are extracted.|$|E
50|$|Communication {{with the}} oral {{environment}} is maintained via {{the opening of}} the periodontal pocket. However, if the opening of a periodontal pocket becomes obstructed, as may occur if the pocket has become very deep (e.g. with furcation involvement), then plaque and calculus are trapped inside. Food packing may also obstruct a periodontal pocket. Food packing is usually caused by failure to accurately reproduce the contact points when dental restorations are placed on the <b>interproximal</b> surfaces of teeth. Another potential cause occurs when a periodontal pocket is scaled incompletely. Following this procedure, the gingival cuff tightens around the tooth, which may be enough to trap the bacteria left in the pocket. A gingival retraction cord which is accidentally left in situ is an occasional cause of a periodontal abscess.|$|E

50|$|P. gingivalis {{has been}} {{associated}} with increasing the virulence of other commensal bacteria in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. P. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles were found to be necessary for the invasion of epithelial cells of Tannerella forsythia. P. gingivalis short fimbriae were found to be necessary for coculture biofilm formation with Streptococcus gordonii. <b>Interproximal</b> and horizontal alveolar bone loss in mouse models are seen in coinfections involving P. gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The role of P. gingivalis as a community activist in periodontitis is seen in specific pathogen-free mouse models of periodontal infections. In these models, P. gingivalis inoculation causes significant bone loss, which is a significant characteristic of the disease. In contrast, germ free mice inoculated with a P. gingivalis monoinfection incur no bone loss, indicating that P. gingivalis alone cannot induce periodontitis.|$|E
