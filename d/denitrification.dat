5|$|Archaea {{carry out}} many {{steps in the}} {{nitrogen}} cycle. This includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems (such as nitrate-based respiration and <b>denitrification)</b> as well as processes that introduce nitrogen (such as nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation).|$|E
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and <b>denitrification</b> and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and <b>denitrification)</b> strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of <b>denitrification,</b> sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Denitrification</b> is the {{reduction}} of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor {{in the place of}} oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. <b>Denitrification</b> happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen {{is removed}} through the {{biological}} oxidation of nitrogen from ammonia to nitrate (nitrification), followed by <b>denitrification,</b> {{the reduction of}} nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water.|$|E
25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through <b>denitrification.</b> While <b>denitrification</b> is encouraged in some treatment processes, <b>denitrification</b> often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluidized}} bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below {{so that the}} sand becomes fluidized â€“ behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, {{and so there is}} a large surface for aerobic <b>denitrification</b> bacteria. Therefore, the size of the filter can be modest.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide in {{biological}} {{systems can be}} formed by an enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitric oxide. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} endogenous nitrous oxide can be formed by the reaction between nitric oxide and thiol. Some authors have shown that this process of NO reduction to N2O takes place in hepatocytes, specifically in their cytoplasm and mitochondria, and suggested that the N2O can possibly be produced in mammalian cells. It is well known that N2O is produced by some bacteria during process called <b>denitrification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently, an {{association}} between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept {{is the assumption that}} bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, <b>denitrification</b> toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom.|$|E
25|$|One {{proposed}} solution to eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish populations, such as oysters. Oyster reefs remove nitrogen {{from the water}} column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of harmful algal blooms or anoxic conditions. Filter feeding activity is considered beneficial to water quality by controlling phytoplankton density and sequestering nutrients, which can {{be removed from the}} system through shellfish harvest, buried in the sediments, or lost through <b>denitrification.</b> Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation to was conducted by Odd Lindahl et al., using mussels in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine {{filtration}} with biological carbon reduction, nitrification or <b>denitrification.</b> BAF usually {{includes a}} reactor {{filled with a}} filter media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer {{at the foot of}} the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in anoxic mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.|$|E

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into various chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen {{can be carried}} out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the {{nitrogen cycle}} include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and <b>denitrification.</b> The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} constantly interchange {{between the}} atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or [...] "fixed", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, {{it is used to}} synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their own proteins and excrete nitrogenâ€“bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and <b>denitrification,</b> returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the Haber process is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogenâ€“bearing waste, when leached, leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine dead zones, as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during <b>denitrification,</b> attacks the atmospheric ozone layer.|$|E
500|$|Light is {{only able}} to {{penetrate}} the top [...] {{so this is the}} only part of the sea where plants can grow. The surface layers are often deficient in biologically-active nitrogen compounds. The marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include the fixation of nitrogen, its assimilation, nitrification, anammox, and <b>denitrification.</b> Some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters or near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Denitrification</b> {{requires}} anoxic {{conditions to}} encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) {{can do the job}} the most easily. Since <b>denitrification</b> is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an electron donor is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), sulfide, or an added donor like methanol. [...] The sludge in the anoxic tanks (<b>denitrification</b> tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge , and raw influent) e.g. by using submersible mixers in order to achieve the desired <b>denitrification.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Denitrification</b> is the {{utilization}} of nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] It is a widespread process {{that is used by}} many members of the Proteobacteria. [...] Many facultative anaerobes use <b>denitrification</b> because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential. [...] Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric iron (...) and some organic electron acceptors. [...] <b>Denitrification</b> involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to nitrite (...) , nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (...) , and dinitrogen (...) by the enzymes nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. [...] Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration. [...] Some organisms (e.g. E. coli) only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite. [...] Others (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans or Pseudomonas stutzeri) reduce nitrate completely. [...] Complete <b>denitrification</b> is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of <b>denitrification</b> (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important greenhouse gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce nitric acid, a component of acid rain. [...] <b>Denitrification</b> is also important in biological wastewater treatment where it is used {{to reduce the amount of}} nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.|$|E

2500|$|Many sewage {{treatment}} plants use axial flow pumps to transfer nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for <b>denitrification.</b> [...] These pumps are {{often referred to}} as internal mixed liquor recycle pumps (IMLR pumps).

2500|$|Over time, {{different}} treatment configurations {{have evolved}} as <b>denitrification</b> {{has become more}} sophisticated. [...] An initial scheme, the Ludzack-Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. [...] Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate {{as a source of}} oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This <b>denitrification</b> scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. [...] Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{photochemical}} processes involved are complex but well understood. The key observation is that, ordinarily, {{most of the}} chlorine in the stratosphere resides in [...] "reservoir" [...] compounds, primarily chlorine nitrate (...) as well as stable end products such as HCl. The formation of end products essentially remove Cl from the ozone depletion process. The former sequester Cl, which can be later made available via absorption of light at shorter wavelengths than 400nm. During the Antarctic winter and spring, however, reactions {{on the surface of}} the polar stratospheric cloud particles convert these [...] "reservoir" [...] compounds into reactive free radicals (Cl and ClO). The process by which the clouds remove [...] from the stratosphere by converting it to nitric acid in the PSC particles, which then are lost by sedimentation is called <b>denitrification.</b> This prevents newly formed ClO from being converted back into [...]|$|E
2500|$|Many sewage {{treatment}} plants use centrifugal pumps {{to transfer the}} nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for <b>denitrification.</b> [...] These pumps are {{often referred to as}} Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle (IMLR) pumps. [...] IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q.) [...] This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. [...] (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF.) [...] At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. [...] These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.|$|E
2500|$|Mouldboard ploughing, in {{cold and}} {{temperate}} climates, no deeper than 20cm, aerates the soil by loosening it. It incorporates crop residues, solid manures, limestone and commercial fertilisers along with oxygen. By doing so, it reduces nitrogen losses by <b>denitrification,</b> accelerates mineralization and increases short-term nitrogen availability for transformation {{of organic matter}} into humus. It erases wheel tracks and ruts caused by harvesting equipment. It controls many perennial weeds and pushes back the growth of other weeds until the following spring. It accelerates soil warming and water evaporation in spring because of the lesser quantity of residues on the soil surface. It facilitates seeding with a lighter seeder. It controls many enemies of crops (slugs, crane flies, seedcorn maggots-bean seed flies, borers). It increases the number of [...] "soil-eating" [...] earthworms (endogea) but is detrimental to vertical-dwelling earthworms (anecic).|$|E
2500|$|Intensive piggeries {{have been}} {{increasingly}} criticized in preference of free range systems. Such systems usually refer {{not to a}} group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems. Those that support outdoor systems usually do so {{on the grounds that}} they are more animal friendly and allow pigs to experience natural activities (e.g., wallowing in mud, relating to young, rooting soil). Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.) [...] They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as <b>denitrification</b> of soil and erosion. [...] Outdoor pig farming may also have welfare implications, for example, pigs kept outside may get sunburnt and are more susceptible to heat stress than in indoor systems, where air conditioning or similar can be used. [...] Outdoor pig farming may also increase the incidence of worms and parasites in pigs. Management of these problems depends on local conditions, such as geography, climate, and the availability of skilled staff.|$|E
2500|$|Agriculture in {{its many}} forms can both {{mitigate}} or worsen global warming. Some {{of the increase}} in CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddy fields, as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through <b>denitrification,</b> releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide. Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to sequester some of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Informed by the UNEP, [...] "griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Cattle and rice farms release methane, fertilized fields release nitrous oxide, and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide. [...] Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through <b>denitrification.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Denitrification</b> also {{becomes the}} key pathway for dissimilative nitrate reduction, {{which is the}} process in which nitrates are reduced from the soil, the former being highly toxic for living organisms. <b>Denitrification</b> tends to produce large amounts of by-products.|$|E
50|$|Aerobic <b>denitrification</b> {{tends to}} produce more nitrous oxide (N2O) than {{anaerobic}} <b>denitrification.</b> The nitrous oxide will in turn yield a highly reactive free oxygen radical, which reacts with and depletes ozone. Nitrous oxide also contributes to global warming.|$|E
50|$|Dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium {{is similar}} to the process of <b>denitrification,</b> though NO2âˆ’ is reduced farther to NH4+ rather than to N2, transferring eight electrons. Both denitrifiers and nitrate ammonifiers are competing for NO3âˆ’ in the environment. Despite the redox potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium being lower than <b>denitrification</b> and producing less Gibbs free energy, energy yield of <b>denitrification</b> may not be efficiently conserved in its series of enzymatic reactions and nitrate ammonifiers may achieve higher growth rates and outcompete denitrifiers. This is may be especially pronounced when NO3âˆ’ is limiting compared to organic carbon, as organic carbon is oxidised more 'efficiently' per NO3âˆ’ (as each molecule NO3âˆ’ is reduced farther). The balance of <b>denitrification</b> and DNRA is important to the nitrogen cycle of an environment as both use NO3âˆ’ but, unlike <b>denitrification,</b> which produces gaseous, non-bioavailable N2 (a sink of nitrogen), DNRA produces bioavailable, soluble NH4+.|$|E
50|$|In some {{wastewater}} treatment plants, {{small amounts of}} methanol, ethanol, acetate, glycerin, or proprietary products {{are added to the}} wastewater to provide a carbon source for the <b>denitrification</b> bacteria. <b>Denitrification</b> processes are also used in the treatment of industrial wastewater.|$|E
5000|$|N2O is an {{inorganic}} metabolite of the {{prokaryotic cell}} during <b>denitrification.</b> Thus, denitrifiers comprise the principal group of N2O producers, with roles played also by nitrifiers, methanotrophic bacteria, and fungi.
