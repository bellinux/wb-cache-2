25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R.

His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>by</b> itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this did}} not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending {{him for a few}} days to MGM in 1933 for his {{significant}} Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film Dancing Lady. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle Flying Down to Rio. In a review, Variety magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of Flying Down to Rio is the screen promise of Fred Astaire... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>by</b> himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.|$|E
