40|$|Aircraft <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> is {{typically}} reduced by optimizing an isolated aircraft component. The noise emission of this component is optimized with high-fidelity tools or wind tunnel measurements. However, if installed on-board {{of the aircraft}} the optimization {{may not have the}} desired effect on the total <b>noise</b> <b>impact</b> due to propagation effects or the interaction with other components. Hence, a method is presented, that derives noise reduction requirements for aircraft components based on the total aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>impact.</b> The method is implemented in a parametric aircraft noise prediction tool and applied to a reference aircraft. The aim is to use the noise requirements within conceptual aircraft design to obtain low-noise aircraft in a target-oriented way. Ultimately, this may be a first step towards a noise-to-design process...|$|R

On the one hand, {{we find that the}} interior noise is larger than <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> under accelerating state, due to the cabin poorly sealing. On the other hand, because of the poor isolation rate of the driver’s seat, the vibration acceleration on the driver’s seat is very great and affecting the driver’s comfort.

40|$|Tyre/road {{interaction}} is recognised {{as the main}} source of interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> for velocities over the 40 km/h. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) elemental approach has been adopted to predict the stochastic tyre vibration and hence the interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> due to this kind of excitation. The road excitation has been modelled from the spectral density of a common road profile, supposing the road to be an isotropic surface. A linear Winkler bedding connects the 3 D model of the tyre with the ground. The <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> has been evaluated by an elemental calculation of the radiation matrix of the tyre deformed by the static load on a concrete road. The noise inside the vehicle has also been calculated, using the transfer functions from the force transmitted to the hub and the noise inside the vehicle, which have been computed by a FEM model of a common car body. The simple formulation allows much quicker calculation than traditional nonlinear approaches, and appears to give results consistent with available measurements, although the effects of tyre rotation and of the nonlinearities in the contact model are yet to be quantified, and the method requires further experimental validation before practical application...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe warning {{effect of}} vehicle <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> for {{vulnerable}} users has recently emerged. Quieter cars could reduce pedestrians ability to travel safely.

First, we identified critical safety scenarios, considering the safety risks and strategies used by pedestrians. Then, we defined the type of vulnerable people, the minimal reaction times, and visual obstacles. The paper aims at characterizing different soundscapes, in order to choose psychoacoustic maskers and determine acoustic characteristics of a selection of vehicles.

Over the years the tool has evolved by extending the modelling scope and level of detail now making it a cornerstone of the complete acoustics management process. One key feature is that BRAINS handles <b>exterior</b> and interior <b>noise</b> predictions with the same model input data as basis thanks to an efficient computational framework. It interacts with the Bombardier acoustics source and material database and can also import data from specialised software such as TWINS. For <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> BRAINS is well positioned {{to be used for}} the emerging field of virtual acoustic authorisation as an alternative to physical testing.

40|$|International audienceDue to legislation, <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> targets {{have been}} {{continuously}} reduced {{in the last}} decades and a new normalsation for pass-by noise is expected. Thus, a numerical tool to predict the noise radiated from a vehicle in an early design stage is needed. Due to the large frequency range {{to be taken into}} account [100 Hz- 2. 5 kHz], the complexity of the domain to be simulated (partial enclosures, exterior field) and the number of DOFs to be considered, <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> simulation reaches the limits of standard deterministic method like FEM or BEM. In the frame of the European project VISPeR, a benchmark of several numerical methodologies aiming at <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> simulation has been conducted by the partners Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF), INSA Lyon, Ecole Centrale de Lyon (ECL) and Rieter. Simple test cases with different treatment configurations, the mock-up of an engine comprtment as well as a real engine compartment have been considered. Deterministic LF methods like indirect BEM and FEM/FEM were tested for their potential to be extended to higher frequencies with a descretisation criterion of lambda/ 6 and a realistic number of DOFs. The Patch Acoustic Impedance PAI method, developed at INSA Lyon and applied together with CRF, is aiming at coupling two uncoupled calculations (one interior, one exterior), thus offering a potential for optimisation. Energetic methods adapted rather for the HF range, like incoherent ray-tracing, applied by Rieter, and the "simplified energy method" SEM method, developed and applied at ACL-LTDS, have been tested. In the case of ray-tracing, the influence of various parameters (e. g. phase and diffraction) has been checked. The sensitivity to acoustic treatment configurations has also been evaluated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Exterior</b> <b>noise</b> {{testing is}} one of the main {{standardized}} quality controls required for developing the majority of vehicles. The combination of static tests and on-road measurements provides an essential key to undertaking a successful refinement process. Beamforming techniques using phased microphone arrays are one of the most common tools for localizing and quantifying noise sources across the vehicle body. However, the use of such devices can result in a series of well-known disadvantages regarding, for instance, their very high cost or transducer calibration problems. Virtual Phased Arrays (VPAs) are proposed as an alternative solution to prevent these difficulties providing the sound field is time stationary. Several frequency domain beamforming techniques can be adapted to only use the relative phase between a fixed and a moving transducer. Therefore the results traditionally obtained using large arrays can be emulated by applying beamforming algorithms to data acquired from two sensors. Simulations and experimental data presented in this paper introduce a first approach to use virtual phased arrays for assessing complex noise problems, such as vehicle <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> radiatio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSustained {{increase}} in air transportation {{as well as}} urban encroachment have generated noise critical situations around airports. Then the prediction of the <b>noise</b> <b>impact</b> resulting from new departure/arrival procedures and new traffic patterns at airports gains more importance. Until recently this estimation has been performed on statistical grounds through the segmentation of nominal aircraft trajectories.

To go beyond this limitation, a dynamical approach to <b>noise</b> <b>impact</b> estimation taking explicitly into consideration the operated 3 D+T aircraft trajectory, is proposed in this communication. This is achieved by taking profit of the differential flatness property of the flight guidance dynamics of transportation aircraft, which allows through inversion to compute the corresponding thrust and aerodynamic conditions which are also responsible for aircraft noise generation. In numerical grounds this is achieved by building a neural network device which produces ground noise levels histories along the trajectories flown by aircraft. The proposed approach is partially validated using for comparison noise levels estimated from the Integrated Noise Model (INM).
