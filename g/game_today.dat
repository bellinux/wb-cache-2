Wenger absolved Senderos of any blame for the two goals – [...] "it would be unfair" [...] – and believed Fàbregas showed why he was a capable replacement for Patrick Vieira, who left in the summer: [...] "He controlled the game and for me was outstanding."

As the landscape of women's soccer continues to evolve, we realize the unique opportunity before us." [...] Because of national team commitments and preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Solo made three appearances for the club, tallying a total of 261 minutes. Her goals against average was 0.344, she made five saves and had one shutout.

500|$|Michigan played {{its second}} {{game of the}} season at home against the team from Grand Rapids High School, (Now Grand Rapids Central High School [...] ). The game was played in halves of 20 and 10 minutes, and Michigan won easily by a score of 44 to 0. A {{newspaper}} account of the game described Michigan's performance as follows:"Michigan is now rapidly rounding into form and the team played a much stronger <b>game</b> <b>today</b> than a week ago. Several of the new men did some creditable work, and the interference at all times was excellent. Hazen Pingree, at half, made several brilliant runs, and Hannan, at full, punted very well. Bennett, Wombacher, Palmer and Farnham also showed up well in the line. Grand Rapids was never able to gain and the 'varsity scored as she pleased." [...] Michigan's lineup in the game was Palmer (left end), Giovanni [...] "Count" [...] Villa (left tackle), Fred Baker (left guard), John David Wombacher (center), John W.F.

[...] Gordie Howe was also impressed by Crosby, [...] "I met him and I've seen him play. Unless you put two guys on him, he'll kill you in a game". In 2016, Mario Lemieux praised his protégé for his ability to play both sides of the puck, [...] "I think he's more of a complete player. Defensively, I think he's improved a lot over the last couple of years." [...] On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Crosby was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. In that same year, Fox Sports ranked Crosby 15th on their [...] "21 greatest athletes of the 21st century (so far)" [...] list.

500|$|The third ODI saw {{a change}} of venue; the teams moving from Dhaka to the coastal town of Chittagong. England again made two bowling changes, seamers Shahzad and Liam Plunkett coming into {{the team with the}} injured Broad and spinner Tredwell making way. Bangladesh {{remained}} unchanged from the second ODI. The hosts won their first toss of the series, and put England into bat. Kieswetter bucked his natural game and played cautiously: when partner Cook was dismissed for 32 in the 13th over, he had scored 20 off 33 balls. The opener continued to accumulate runs carefully until he reached his half-century in the 33rd over. After passing the milestone, he began to score quicker, cutting and driving as he shared a 74-run partnership with Collingwood. He reached his century with a scampered run off Rubel Hossain, his first in international cricket, in his third ODI appearance. At 22 years and 97 days old, he became the second youngest England batsman to score an ODI century after David Gower. In contrast to the [...] "all-action" [...] style that had been expected from him, Kieswetter accrued his century with resolve, saying after the match that: [...] "In the first two games I wasn't quite aware tactically of how I was going to pace my innings, [...] helping the team win the <b>game.</b> <b>Today</b> I tried to pace myself a bit more, and try to get myself in more before playing big shots." [...] His dismissal soon after his century brought Wright to the crease with the freedom to make an aggressive cameo, notching 32 runs off just 13 balls to help England towards a total of 284.|$|E
500|$|Garland {{entered the}} season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's {{basketball}} roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in 2012–13, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on [...]500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against Manhattan. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with {{minutes left in the}} game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against Quinnipiac at the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, [...] "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the <b>game</b> <b>today</b> was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't do something, and then you learn from it and do better, so I am pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against Morgan State, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs VCU. His team's 10-point 2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to St. Bonaventure, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened the}} 2013–14 {{season with a}} home defeat to Aston Villa, which {{prompted}} boos from the supporters. The club's transfer inactivity over the summer was criticised, but Wenger assessed: [...] "We could have won the <b>game</b> <b>today</b> with {{the players on the}} pitch, I'm convinced of that." [...] In the final week of the transfer window, he re-signed Flamini and sanctioned the club record signing of Mesut Özil from Real Madrid, totalling £42.5 million. Wenger was instrumental in the latter deal; he phoned and spoke to the German in his native language, convincing him that a move to England would enhance his career. Arsenal's form thereafter improved and Aaron Ramsey's goalscoring spree elevated the team to first position by the New Year. Poor performances in the big games, however, blighted Arsenal's title credentials, with a 6–0 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge being described as [...] "a good hiding [...] you don't prepare all week to experience that." [...] The defeat marked Wenger's 1,000th match in charge of Arsenal. Arsenal consolidated fourth position in the league, and Wenger guided his team to FA Cup success, as they came from two goals down to beat Hull City in the final, and clinch Arsenal their first trophy in nine years. At the end of the season, Wenger signed another three-year extension to his Arsenal contract. He strengthened the squad by signing Alexis Sánchez from Barcelona in July 2014, and during the course of 2014–15, promoted Francis Coquelin and Héctor Bellerín into the first team. Wenger won his sixth FA Cup in May 2015, which placed him alongside George Ramsay as the most successful manager in the competition's history. Wenger further guided the club to improved league finishes in the following two seasons, finishing runners-up in the 2015–16 season.|$|E
500|$|Benfica ended March {{with their}} {{objectives}} intact, so April became a crucial month. After a ten-day international break, Benfica resumed {{competition with the}} Clássico at home against Porto on 1 April. The visitors scored first through Pepe in the 41st minute, but Benfica equalized in the 83rd minute with an own-goal from Lucho González. Santos attributed the draw to Porto goalkeeper Helton's performance, saying, [...] "Helton made three or four great saves. We were better {{in the second half}} and we deserved to win." [...] On the following Thursday, Benfica visited the Olímpic de Montjuïc to face Espanyol. The Spaniards pushed hard from early on and scored first through Raúl Tamudo in the 15th minute; shortly after the half-hour mark, Albert Riera made it 2–0 and in the second half, Walter Pandiani added a third goal. Benfica reacted; Nuno Gomes scored to make the score 3–1 in the 63rd minute. Two minutes later, Simão scored Benfica's second goal and the match ended in a 3–2 loss. Santos blamed the poor first half for the loss, saying, [...] "Like with Porto, we were lost in the first half, and let our opponent play." [...] On 9 April, Benfica played Beira-Mar at the Estádio Municipal de Aveiro. Beira-Mar surprised Benfica and imposed on them a 2–2 draw in a match that Santos had labelled [...] "title deciding". Santos accepted the result and commented, [...] "We have to think in Thursday match, because our <b>game</b> <b>today</b> was bad. Beira-Mar had a lot of merit. The title is now harder but we will not renounce it." [...] On 12 April, Benfica received Espanyol for the second leg of the quarter-finals. A slow first half contrasted with a high-pressure second, in which the woodwork and Gorka Iraizoz helped Espanyol defend the goalless draw, allowing Espanyol to proceed to the semi-finals.|$|E
