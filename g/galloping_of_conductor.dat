40|$|According to the <b>galloping</b> {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> iced <b>conductors,</b> the aerodynamic simulations {{were performed}} based on actual wind tunnel tests. Aeroelastic models of single and bundled conductors with a typical ice-coating section forms (crescent section) were set up. The simulation results were in good agreements with wind tunnel tests, {{and it showed}} that numerical simulation method can be used instead of wind tunnel tests. The wind attack angles have seriously affected the aerodynamic force <b>of</b> the iced <b>conductor.</b> The wake <b>of</b> vortex shedding for the iced single conductor was analyzed. As for the iced bundled conductors, sub-conductors at the downstream were seriously influenced by the ones at the upstream locations and the aerodynamic force of the sub-conductors at the downstream was lower than of those at the upstream. The negative slope of Nigol coefficient to the bundled conductors was larger {{than that of the}} single wire, but the absolute value of the amplitude was less than that <b>of</b> the single <b>conductor,</b> and the bundled conductors were more likely to gallop than the single ones. The Den. Hartog and O. Nigol mechanism were used to predict <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> iced <b>conductors,</b> which can be convenient for analyzing vibration <b>of</b> iced <b>conductors...</b>|$|R

The available conductor galloping monitoring methods often employ acceleration sensors {{to measure the}} conductor translations without considering the conductor twist. In this paper, a new sensor for monitoring <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> transmission lines based on an inertial measurement unit and wireless communication is proposed. An inertial measurement unit is used for collecting the accelerations and angular rates <b>of</b> a <b>conductor,</b> which are further transformed into the corresponding geographic coordinate frame using a quaternion transformation to reconstruct the <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conductor.</b> Both the hardware design and the software design are described in details.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Galloping</b> <b>of</b> power {{transmission}} lines {{is a low}} frequency self-oscillation with large amplitude. The aerodynamic effect on each sub-conductor <b>of</b> 4 -bundle <b>conductor</b> is different due to wake-flow-influence. In order to explore the reasons leading to galloping, a 3 -D model for {{power transmission}} line is built. A two-node quadratic beam element in 3 -D and a structure mass element are applied to establish the finite element model of iced 4 -bundle conductor in ANSYS software. Then dynamic transient response calculations are made on this model. According to the results, difference in vibration of sub-conductors and frequency coupling of torsional and transverse vibration can be confirmed. The simulation results illustrate the wake-flow-influence effect and the coupled motions effect on <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> 4 -bundle <b>conductor...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of transmission tower-line systems' progressive collapse performance is {{considered as a}} major research hotspot and significant project, due to {{the increasing number of}} wind-induced collapse accidents recently. In this study, the finite element models for single tower and transmission tower-line system were established to simulate wind-induced progressive collapse by birth-to-death element technique in ABAQUS/Explicit. The wind field, based on the Kaimal fluctuating wind power spectrum and harmonic superposition method, was constructed by MATLAB commercial software. The current research focuses on the dynamic behaviour and the mechanism of a typical transmission tower-line system progressive collapse under wind action with clear step-by-step description. The {{numerical simulation}} results demonstrated that transmission tower-line system collapse mechanism depended on the number, position and last deformation of damage elements. Since the <b>gallop</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> and ground lines were ignored in the single tower model, the transmission tower-line system model, which has higher computational precision than the single tower model, is relatively accurate and recommended strongly in the design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Galloping</b> <b>of</b> {{transmission}} lines creates some cyclic stresses in the conductor and accreted atmospheric ice covering the conductor, which {{may result in}} ice failure leading to shedding. Attempts {{have been made in}} this research to estimate these cyclic stresses and experimental tests have been conducted to study their effects on atmospheric ice. First, <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> an ice-covered <b>conductor</b> was simulated by appropriate modification of existing models for bare conductors submitted to galloping. Then, the results of simulation were applied as input for a new model developed using ABAQUS. Results show that the layers of atmospheric ice at the top and bottom <b>of</b> the <b>conductor</b> endure maximum stress. The results of experimental tests with increasing cyclic stress show that ice does not break during galloping at wind velocities below 4. 5 m/s. The tests under cyclic loads with constant amplitude reveal that the ice does not fail under stresses corresponding to wind speeds of 3 and 4 m/s, and sometimes fails under stresses arising at a wind speed of 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} {{force of}} iced-conductor {{is the driving}} force <b>of</b> <b>galloping,</b> its variation is depended on the aerodynamic character <b>of</b> iced <b>conductor.</b> The aerodynamic character <b>of</b> iced <b>conductor</b> is the key factor <b>of</b> <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> iced-conductor, but the result of theoretically analysis and numerical simulation isn’t suited for the requirement of transmission line project. In the paper, basing on the theoretically analysis and numerical simulation, the simulation tests in wind tunnel <b>of</b> crescent-shaped iced <b>conductor</b> is stetted up and put into practice, and then the systemic study is carried into execution. The result of research is indicated that there is a better coherence between the numerical simulation and experiment test, and the result of numerical simulation is the beneficial supplement to the experiment test. The result can not only provide the original date for the galloping analysis, but also validate the affectivity of numerical simulation, support the research of mechanism and control <b>of</b> <b>galloping...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} many reports {{recently}} on unanticipated galloping and collapse accidents of tower-line systems due to downburst wind with rainfall. Although wet downburst is characterized by high-velocity wind with rainfall, very little research work is involved with <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> high-voltage transmission line induced by the downburst wind with rainfall. Thus, this article proposes a preliminary theoretical study aiming to provide an analytical model of the high-voltage transmission line subjected to the downburst wind with rainfall to explain some phenomena observed from field measurements. Through wind or rain–wind tunnel experiments, we obtained aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the high-voltage <b>conductor</b> with different yaw angles and rainfall rates. Considering the variations of several factors such as wind velocity, rainfall rate, yaw angle, and attack angle, the proposed analytical model was created by finite element method and central differences with the obtained aerodynamic coefficients <b>of</b> the high-voltage <b>conductor.</b> The theoretical results accord well with the experimental data. The analytical model enables better comprehension <b>of</b> the <b>galloping</b> <b>of</b> the high-voltage transmission line subjected to the downburst wind with rainfall...|$|R
