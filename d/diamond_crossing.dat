5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station. Two new station buildings {{opened to}} replace it: a passenger station (the {{centerpiece of the}} new Depot Square) in {{the northeast corner of}} the junction, and a freight station in the southeast which replaced the formerly separate freight houses. In 1897, the junction of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the grade crossing. The old Stony Brook freight house and engine house were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over the junction in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various train movements across the complex junction.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> is an {{asterism}} in {{the southern}} constellation Carina. The <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> is composed of four bright stars: Beta, Theta, Upsilon and Omega Carinae. These four bright stars create an almost perfect diamond shape, hence the name [...] "Diamond Cross". The entire asterism is visible to all observers south of 20°N latitude. It bears {{a striking resemblance to}} Crux (The Southern Cross) and the False Cross, and, like them, it lacks a central star in its cross pattern, creating a diamond-shaped or kite-like appearance. Both the <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross</b> and the False Cross are sometimes mistaken for the true cross Crux, although the False Cross has always been a worse deceiver than the <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cross,</b> because most of its stars have approximately the same declinations as the stars of Crux.|$|R

25|$|The {{railroad}} junction at Englewood, where Metra (the former Rock Island) crosses Norfolk Southern (the former Pennsylvania) {{has long}} been a cause of delay. In March 2010 a $133 million reconstruction project was announced which improved operations by replacing the <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> between Metra and NS with an overpass for Metra. The project was completed in 2014.|$|E
25|$|A single lead {{junction}} is used where {{traffic density}} is lower, and moves {{one of the}} turnouts on the main line onto the branch. This may {{reduce the number of}} turnouts on the main line that are subject to wear. The <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> is a wearing component due to the gaps in the K-crossings, and this configuration eliminates the diamond.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest arrangement {{consists of}} two turnouts and a fixed <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing.</b> Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the curve radius is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km/h. This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space. Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point rodding of a single signal box.|$|E

25|$|While PATH once shared {{trackage}} {{with the}} PRR, this joint running and all interlocking connections to former {{lines have been}} cut, except for one <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> on a siding near the Hudson tower. Due to its relative isolation from the national rail network, PATH could potentially end {{its status as a}} railroad. However, this railroad status might prove valuable if PATH were to extend service along existing rail routes as normally transit lines are required to either run on separate rights of way or have time separation with FRA railroads.|$|E
500|$|South Groton, {{until then}} [...] "about a dozen farms of {{doubtful}} prosperity" [...] and hindered by its remoteness, was quickly {{transformed by the}} railroads. A new union station known as Groton Junction was constructed in 1848 {{just east of the}} <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing.</b> Like many large stations of that era, it had a massive arched trainshed, which spanned the Fitchburg mainline. Smaller secondary arches to either side were intended for the Stony Brook and the P, but that arrangement soon proved inconvenient. A temporary wooden building was used while the union station was being constructed, although some W trains used the Fitchburg tracks to reach the original station. The temporary station and the original station and freight house were moved and used for other purposes in town; the temporary station burned in the 1872 fire, but the other two buildings lasted at least into the 1890s.|$|E
500|$|Although Camp Devens {{opening in}} 1917 briefly {{increased}} traffic, competition from interurban streetcars (including {{a line on}} Central Street built around 1905) then automobiles in the early 20th century forced the B to discontinue service on marginal branch lines, as well as redundant routes built during years of intense competition between railroads. Passenger service on the lightly used Brookline & Pepperell ended in 1931 and on the P 1933. The Stony Brook, with its flatter grades than the W, became the preferred route for passenger and freight service to the north, particularly after a wye was constructed at North Chelmsford in 1930 allowing direct service to New Hampshire. Through Worcester-Portland local service ended in 1928; the <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> was removed, and part of Plow Shop Pond was filled in to create the southwest leg of the junction, thus finishing a wye [...] between the Fitchburg main and the line to Worcester. Passenger service ended on {{the northern part of}} the W in 1934, and part of the route to Nashua was outright abandoned within a decade.|$|E

500|$|Three more railroads {{followed}} in short succession. The Stony Brook Railroad opened from Ayer to North Chelmsford with service to Lowell in July 1848; it ran {{parallel to the}} Fitchburg for several miles east of downtown Ayer before branching to the northeast at Stony Brook Junction. [...] Located at the junction, Willows station (also known as Sandy Pond) {{was the only other}} train station in Ayer and served both the Stony Brook and the Fitchburg. The Worcester and Nashua Railroad (W) opened between Worcester and Ayer on July 3, 1848; an extension north to Nashua, New Hampshire on December 18, 1848 crossed the Fitchburg on a <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> and a connecting line was built on the southeast corner of the junction. The Peterborough and Shirley Railroad (P), opened in February 1848, crossed the northern section of the W at grade and ran to the northwest. It was leased to the Fitchburg before opening and fully acquired in 1860. The line had originally been intended to meet the Fitchburg Railroad in Shirley to the west, but the terminus was changed to Groton to connected with the W ...|$|E
2500|$|A double {{junction}} with a diamond can have its speed limit raised if the track centres are widened from say 4 m to say 12 m {{to allow for}} a fixed coarse-angled <b>diamond</b> <b>crossing</b> with fine-angled turnouts.
