25|$|Long Way to the Top was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part {{documentary}} {{on the history of}} Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. Episode 3: Billy Killed the Fish, broadcast on 29 August, featured interviews with Loyde, Michael Chugg (Thorpe's manager / promoter) and Thorpe. They described their Sunbury festival experiences and the development of pub rock in Australia. According to Chugg, an Aztec performance at Sydney's Bondi Lifesaver club in 1974 was so loud as to kill a tankful of tropical fish in an upstairs area–hence the <b>episode</b> <b>title.</b> During August 2002, promoters Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen with Thorpe as co-producer, organised a related concert tour, Long Way to the Top. Concerts included Thorpe performing with the 'original' Aztecs line-up in one set and the 'Sunbury' Aztecs in a second. Performances at two Sydney concerts in September were recorded, broadcast on ABC-TV and subsequently released on DVD in December.|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{that the}} use of both the [...] "Day After Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Into Infinity" [...] titles would confuse British audiences (as The Day After Tomorrow was to air not as a pilot, but as a special on UK television), the BBC edited the opening titles to delete the former. In any case, the removal of the <b>episode</b> <b>title,</b> [...] "Into Infinity", would have been more difficult; while the series title appears against a simple starfield, the <b>episode</b> <b>title</b> is {{superimposed}} on a moving model shot of the lift that transfers the Bowen and Masters families from Space Station Delta to Altares during the programme's opening scenes. Consequently, The Day After Tomorrow was listed in Radio Times magazine and other British media exclusively under the title of [...] "Into Infinity".|$|E
