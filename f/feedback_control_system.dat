25|$|While PID {{controllers}} {{are applicable}} to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, {{and do not}} in general provide optimal control. The fundamental difficulty with PID control {{is that it is}} a <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> with constant parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an observer without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> It compares the phases of two input signals and {{produces}} an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E
25|$|In Greece, a water {{clock was}} known as a clepsydra (water thief). The Greeks {{considerably}} advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person's life was at stake for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.|$|E

2500|$|Production of T3 and its prohormone {{thyroxine}} (T4) {{is activated}} by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is {{released from the}} anterior pituitary gland. [...] This pathway {{is part of a}} closed-loop feedback process: Elevated concentrations of T3, and T4 in the blood plasma inhibit the production of TSH in the anterior pituitary gland. As concentrations of these hormones decrease, the anterior pituitary gland increases production of TSH, and by these processes, a <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> stabilizes the amount of thyroid hormones that are in the bloodstream.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the system}} is {{originally}} open-loop unstable, feedback is necessary to stabilize the system. [...] Right-half-plane (RHP) poles represent that instability. [...] For closed-loop stability of a system, the number of closed-loop roots in the right half of the s-plane must be zero. Hence, the number of counter-clockwise encirclements about [...] must be equal {{to the number of}} open-loop poles in the RHP. [...] Any clockwise encirclements of the critical point by the open-loop frequency response (when judged from low frequency to high frequency) would indicate that the <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> would be destabilizing if the loop were closed. [...] (Using RHP zeros to [...] "cancel out" [...] RHP poles does not remove the instability, but rather ensures that the system will remain unstable even in the presence of feedback, since the closed-loop roots travel between open-loop poles and zeros in the presence of feedback. In fact, the RHP zero can make the unstable pole unobservable and therefore not stabilizable through feedback.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} a smart aircraft double panel for active vibroacoustic control. The control of the double panel vibration is implemented using Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) decentralised velocity feedback loops. The loops are applied via an array of electrodynamic force actuators and collocated velocity sensors. The actuators are located in an air cavity between the two panels such that they can react against the two panels. Two velocity sensors per actuator are used. Either sensor {{is located at the}} source and radiating panel footprint of an actuator. The error velocity is formed by subtracting weighted sensor outputs. In the introductory part of the thesis a survey of aircraft interior noise is given, and stateof- the-art passive and active noise control methods are presented. In Chapter two the mathematical model for the theoretical analysis of the smart double panel is formulated and a parametric study of passive sound transmission is performed using the mathematical model. In Chapter three the performance of decentralised <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> using absolute and relative velocity is analysed theoretically. In Chapter four the stability and performance of decentralised <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> using reactive actuators driven with weighted velocity error signals is analysed theoretically.
