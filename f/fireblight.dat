50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard <b>fireblight</b> (Erwinia amylovora), woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to woolly apple aphid. Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to collar rot and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.|$|E

The necessity of achieving early production in order to recover investment quickly requires fast tree growth, which may increase susceptibility to fire blight, especially with the cultivars and rootstocks now favored by the industry. Through this project we are studying the relationship between plant nutrition and fire blight severity {{and the effect of}} the new growth regulator “Apogee” on <b>fireblight</b> control on young trees. Our results to date indicate that different fertilization practices can have a small but significant effect on tree growth and on shoot blight severity. In general, the lower the nitrogen fertilization rate the lower the severity of <b>fireblight</b> infection; however, unfertilized trees have the poorest tree growth. The best combination of growth and the least severity of <b>fireblight</b> was with the high K treatment. The most promising results were with the new environmentally friendly growth regulator “Apogee”.

40|$|AbstractThe ams region, {{responsible}} for amylovoran {{synthesis of the}} <b>fireblight</b> pathogen Erwinia amylovora, contains the gene amsI encoding a 144 amino acid protein with homology to mammalian low molecular weight acid phosphatases [Bugert and Geider (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 15, 917 – 933]. A DNA fragment with amsI was cloned {{under the control of}} the lac promoter on a high copy number plasmid. The gene product of amsI is about 17 kDa in a protein expression system and had the enzymatic activity of an acid phosphatase. This is the first report about a low molecular weight acid phosphatase activity in prokaryotes. As part of the large ams transcript, expression of amsI was affected by the activator proteins RcsA and RcsB. Overexpression of amsI in E. amylovora caused a strong increase of acid phosphatase activity, but additionally a strong reduction in EPS synthesis, phenotypically similar to a mutation in the gene. The gene product may participate in changes of phosphorylation required for the biosynthesis of EPS such as recycling the lipid carrier diphosphate to the monophosphate form...|$|E
40|$|The {{exudation}} of gum-like bacterial masses from diseased regions is {{a frequent}} feature of <b>fireblight</b> [Erwinia arnylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al. ] and other bacterial plant diseases. Exudate usually appears on the plant surface as small globules, a spreading film, or occa-sionally as fine aerial strands (Eden-Green & Billing, 1972; Billing & Eden-Green, 1973) and may provide a source of inoculum when transported by wind or wind-blown rain. Emergence of exudate follows the development of extensive internal bacterial populations, sometimes before other disease symptoms (wilt or necrosis) appear (Gowda & Goodman, 1970). Since bacteria account for only about 20 % of the dry weight of exudate removed from plant surfaces, analysis of the substantial non-bacterial moiety is of interest {{in view of the}} physical properties involved in the formation of aerial strands and its possible role in disease physiology. METHODS Potted apple, pear and hawthorn plants were inoculated with Erwina amylovora by needle puncture of the stem below the tip of a growing shoot, or by cutting off the apices of recently unfolded leaves with scissors dipped in inoculum (Eden-Green, 1972).

40|$|The {{genetics}} of the {{two major}} exopolysaccharides of Erwinia amylovora, levan and amylovoran, were determined. Transposon mutants lacking levan synthesis were fully virulent on immature pears and showed retarded <b>fireblight</b> symptoms on shoots of pear seedlings. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 46. 6 kD, which is close to the molecular weight of the purified enzyme. Mutants deficient in amylovoran synthesis were non-pathogenic. The ams-genes, involved in synthesis of the acidic EPS, were mapped, and a DNA fragment of the region was sequenced. At least six genes seem to be involved in amylovoran synthesis. Among other possible factors, EPS-synthesis is regulated by the rcsA protein and by the sugar concentration in the environment. Lectin staining of the capsule confirmed the results about EPS production on plates and revealed loose association of EPS to cells in ooze of immature pears. The rcsA gene is also involved in regulation of levan synthesis. Levansucrase is expressed independently from the carbon source and secreted into the culture medium.

30|$|Present study {{highlights}} {{an unusual}} non-fluorescent hydroxamate broad spectrum siderophore (SID EGYII) activity from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801, a soil bacterial isolate, along with simple low cost effective siderophore bioassay. Detection of SID EGYII activity qualitatively was proved by masking this activity against Erwinia amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800, an indicator strain, in well-cut diffusion assay containing 100  µM FeCl 3. SID EGYII activity was expressed quantitatively as arbitrary units [Siderophore arbitrary units (SAU)] 380 SAU/mL against E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800. Maximal SID EGYII activity was achieved upon growing P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801 in PYB broth at 180  rpm for 24  h. SID EGYII displayed {{a broad spectrum}} antimicrobial activity against some human pathogens (i.e., Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts) and a <b>fireblight</b> plant pathogen. Interestingly, transformants of Escherichia coli JM 109 (DE 3)pSID/EGYII harboring P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801 plasmid demonstrated a perceivable antimicrobial activity against E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800. The broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the unusual non-fluorescent SID EGYII would underpin its high potential in targeting bacterial pathogens posing probable threats to human health and agricultural economy.

40|$|Exopolysaccharide (EPS) {{synthesis}} by Erwinia amylovora {{depends on}} environmental and genetic predispositions. To measure {{the amount of}} the acidic EPS amylovoran synthesized by E. amylovora cell cultures, a turbidity assay using cetylpyridinium salt was developed. The EPS produced by bacteria grown on solid media was additionally characterized by its water content. The amylovoran capsules were visualized in situ by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled lectin from Abrus precatorius, which reacts with the galactose residue of the EPS side chain. The staining and the turbidity assays were applied to suspension cell cultures or to cells from colonies and did not require any purification steps. Lectin staining was superior to electron microscopic (EM) techniques for visualization of capsules. For EM, the capsule was stabilized with polycationic ferritin. In contrast to lectin staining, {{only a small fraction of}} the cells was found to be EPS-coated in the EM assay. An increase in capsulation and in amylovoran production was found in conjunction with mutations in a ribosomal protein conferring resistance to streptomycin. Furthermore, the presence of sorbitol in the growth environment resulted in high synthesis of amylovoran. Cells in the stationary growth phase continued to produce amylovoran. Apparently, the strong dependence of the <b>fireblight</b> pathogen on capsules requires the capacity for EPS synthesis in all growth stages in order to escape plant defence reactions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>fireblight</b> {{pathogen}} Erwinia amylovora synthesizes {{two different}} types of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) when cultured in vitro, an acidic and a neutral compound. Neutral EPS was prepared from culture supernatants by cross-flow ultrafiltration and molecular washing, and purified by column chromatography. This material represented most of the crude EPS, which was produced in high-sucrose medium. It was entirely composed of fructose. The signals obtained from the EPS-preparation by 13 C-NMR spectroscopy were identical with those of levan from Aerobacter levanicum indicating a β- 2, 6 linkage of the sugar residues. The neutral component of the EPS was thus identified as levan (β- 2, 6 -d-fructofuranan). In the protein fraction associated with crude EPS, the levan polymerizing enzyme levansucrase (β- 2, 6 -d-fructan: d-glucose 6 -fructosyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 10) was detected. The enzyme was also produced at similar levels with several carbon sources by the bacterium. In polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis its molecular weight under completely denaturating conditions was 46 kDa, when purified to apparent homogeneity by membrane-exchange chromatography. However, in isoelectric focussing, the enzyme preparation produced two bands at pI 4 · 0 and pI 3 · 6, respectively. Both bands displayed enzyme activity in an in situ levansucrase assay.
