40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{that each of}} these expectations has played an important role. In the 1990 s, the decline in alcohol consumption across the developed part of the world was outstripped by a rise in total alcoholic intake in most developing nations, to the extent that total world demand increased by over 10 %. Not so for wine consumption which kept falling in the 1990 s, as it had done ever since its peak in the late 1970 s, {{at an annual rate of}} 1. 3 %. The trade numbers suggest, amongst other things, that the EU share of internal trade is diminishing (from 92 % in 1990 - 92 to 85 % in 1995 - 97, in value terms) along with its share of world exports (current EU 15 members would have made up 69 % of the reported value of trade in the early 1990 s and only 63 % five years later), thereby bringing the proportion of world trade imputable to purely <b>internal</b> <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> to drop from 63 % to 53 % (i. e. some 10 percentage points below levels enjoyed at the beginning of the decade, to represent just over half world exchanges in the mid-to-late 1990 s). And, the EU is shipping relatively less in just about every market (including its own) except Mercosur and Asia which is on the brink of becoming its second largest export market after North America...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we will {{study the effects of}} the {{construction}} of an internal market in Europe in 1992. The question to be answered is whether some regions in Europe have improved their positions in the <b>internal</b> <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> from a better exploitation of their comparative advantages (productivity, factors endowment, [...] .) and scale economies, as far as regions have two main reasons for trade: specialization in those activities they do the best and the exploitation of scale economies. The evolution of inter industrial trade will reveal whether the expectations of some qualified economist of a deeper specialization of northern European regions in human capital-intensive industries and in labour-intensive industries in the southern regions were correct. Besides, the development of intra industrial trade in this decade will prove if the benefits of scale economies were bigger in the south, where they were less exploited at the outset. Finally, we will also analyse the role of foreign direct investment (which can be observed as another way of exports and shares with trade the causal factors) in the reinforcement of specialization patterns across Europe. In this connection, we identify and analyse the evolution of trade patterns in Europe in the 1990 ´s through the utilization of Grubel-Lloyd index. Secondly, we utilize several indicators of comparative advantages (sectors average productivity, labour costs, human capital endowment, etc.) and of firms size to study whether they have also undergone some changes {{as a result of the}} internal market formation. Although the lack of regional data can make us formulate this analysis for countries rather than for regions, whenever necessary we will supplement it with the patterns of regional specialization within the countries, as far as the regional location of export industries can shed some light on this issue. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the world economy trend, the {{collapse}} in world trade in goods and services observed {{in the last quarter}} of 2008 intensified in the first quarter of 2009, but the trough in growth rates has likely been reached; positive quarterly growth rates are expected by the end of 2009. UE- 27 registered the slowest export growth of any region last year, with an expansion of just 0. 0 per cent, down from 3. 5 per cent in 2007. Import growth turned negative in 2008, falling by 1 per cent (+ 3. 5 per cent in 2007). If the 27 members of the European Union are considered collectively (excluding <b>internal</b> <b>EU</b> <b>trade),</b> the five leading exporters were the European Union (15. 9 per cent of world exports), China (8. 9 %), the United States (8. 1 %), Japan (4. 9 %) and Netherlands (3. 9 per cent). Exports from the EU were worth US$ 1. 93 trillion in 2008. Signs of recovery are not yet so clearly visible in the EU- 27 like in USA, in the last part of 2009. Each country has its own specific combination of weaknesses such as bursting housing bubbles, declining exports and damaged financial sectors. The eventual recovery is likely to be slow as rising unemployment will hit consumer spending. In the above mentioned conditions, GDP in the euro area is expected to contract 4. 8 % in 2009 and to show 0 % growth in 2010. The previous projections were for a 4. 1 % fall in 2009 and a 0. 3 % fall in 2010. The main factors with a positive influence, taken into consideration for revising up the projections for 2010 in euro area are: the strengthening growth in world trade which will help support a turnaround in exports, the governmental policy support and an easing of financial conditions adopted in some countries. exports, imports, world trade, recession, recovery, accession, integration share...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{convince}} the reader of the potential of a critical version of historical institutionalism (HI) as a theoretical perspective for <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> policy analysis.

The core concept in critical HI is ‘reactive sequencing’, conceiving of policy evolution as a chain of events produced by reactions and counter-reactions. This paper demonstrates that this is invaluable to understand contemporary <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> politics. Some examples of <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> policy decisions and its general strategic evolution since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round are given to show the value of critical HI. Finally, the external dimension of “Europe 2020 ” as the latest trade policy strategy is analysed from a critical historical institutionalist angle. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has affected the}} unit labour cost position of the Austrian manufacturing sector. Per-capita labour productivity declined by 10. 1 percent in Austria, while <b>EU</b> <b>trading</b> partners saw a drop in productivity of 11. 1 percent. At the same time, labour costs rose by 2. 0 percent in Austria, compared to an average decline of 1. 0 percent among the <b>EU</b> <b>trading</b> partners. Thus manufacturing unit labour costs increased by 13. 5 percent in Austria, while <b>EU</b> <b>trading</b> partners saw a rise in unit labour costs of 9. 8 percent. In {{the economy as a}} whole, unit labour costs rose by 4. 8 percent, more than the average of <b>EU</b> <b>trading</b> partners (+ 2. 7 percent) and of all trading partners (+ 3. 4 percent). These numbers must be considered with some caution. Policy measures to fight the crisis and their impact differed between countries.

40|$|The December 2015 {{reform of}} <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> mark law {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of a new exclusive right against goods in transit in Art. 9 (4) of the <b>EU</b> <b>Trade</b> Mark Regulation and Art. 10 (4) of the Trade Mark Directive. This new right raises complex questions of compliance with the international guarantee of freedom of transit set forth in Art. V GATT. In the light of the applicable international provisions, the status of the new right against goods in transit must at least be qualified as ambiguous. It is conceivable that it will be challenged on the ground that it leads to an unjustified impediment of international trade. As the new <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> mark legislation requires the application of Art. 9 (4) of the <b>EU</b> <b>Trade</b> Mark Regulation and Art. 10 (4) of the Trade Mark Directive in line with international standards, in particular Art. V GATT, courts will have to face the complexity of the international legal framework and develop workable solutions by applying an amalgam of EU and international law. The result of this exercise will show whether the potential corrosive effect of the new right can be kept within reasonable limits.

40|$|How has <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> policy {{responded to}} the {{protracted}} economic crisis starting in 2008 ? Unlike during the Great Depression of the 1930 s, politicians have not resorted to protectionist measures to try to contain the downturn. The response has been just the opposite, with the dominant discourse arguing that in times of austerity and private deleveraging, trade liberalisation is indispensable for restoring growth. Adopting a historical-institutionalist perspective, we argue that the crisis has had an asymmetric effect on {{the two most important}} subsystems of <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> policy. On the one hand, the EU took a leap forward on the path of bilateral free trade liberalisation by starting negotiations with the US, Canada and Japan. On the other hand, proposals to continue with permissive reforms for the adoption of trade defence easures and to give the EU more leverage vis-à-vis merging economies have been blocked. We thus conclude that <b>EU</b> <b>trade</b> policy after the crisis has shown asymmetric continuity, where the liberalisation trend has been resumed more radically while accompanying defensive reforms to ease the potential pain of liberalisation have run into a stalemate...|$|R
