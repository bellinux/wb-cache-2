5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Virginia Military Institute, Lansdale joined the United States Army Reserve. He was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the field artillery branch in 1933, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1937. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, {{a few months before}} the United States entered World War II, and was assigned to the Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military <b>intelligence)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War Department General Staff.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness and <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people of}} Rurutu, {{as well as}} the success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the Tahitian port of Papeete - exceptionally high trade volumes in light of the relatively small size of the island and its population.|$|E
5|$|More {{contentious}} {{than the}} lower house was {{the question of the}} upper house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by {{the lower house}}. James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10–1 by the delegates. Most delegates didn't question the <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Virginia Military Institute and Harvard Law School, Lansdale was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1933.

Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other agencies such as the FBI.|$|E
5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{returning}} to the United States following his service in Siberia, Eichelberger became Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (<b>Intelligence),</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippine Department on 4 May 1920. Like many officers {{in the aftermath of}} World War I, he was reduced in rank to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920, but was immediately promoted to major again the next day. Em had joined him in Vladivostok in March 1920, and the two first travelled to Japan before moving on to the Philippines. In March 1921, Eichelberger became head of the Intelligence Mission to China. He established intelligence offices in Peking and Tientsin, and met the President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He finally returned to the United States in May 1921, where he was assigned to the Far Eastern Section of the G-2 (Intelligence) Division of the War Department General Staff.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November the 57th Independent Battalion {{advanced}} {{against the}} TO in Veliki Miletinac (east {{of the area}} captured in Operation Swath-10), capturing the village the same day. The neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the following day, and on 12 November the HV captured the villages of Bastajski Brđani and Rekići. Two days later the TO counterattacked, killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten more, but the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski Brđani {{was made by the}} TO, reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles. It failed (despite being well prepared and supported by artillery) because the defending HV force was alerted by signals <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack and reinforced. The White Eagles lost 46 killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Combine are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that {{are the product of}} Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2. In addition to their role within the Half-Life series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in a shot in Seacoal, a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about youth unemployment in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silent. This piece was exhibited at the Laing Art Gallery in 2012 as part of the exhibition Futureland Now.|$|E
