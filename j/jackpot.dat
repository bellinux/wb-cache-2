5|$|Powerball is {{a drawing}} {{game in which}} players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins the <b>jackpot.</b> <b>Jackpot</b> amounts begin at $40 million and grow with each drawing in which the <b>jackpot</b> is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. The <b>jackpot</b> is pari-mutuel, meaning that if {{multiple}} tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total <b>jackpot.</b>|$|E
5|$|The largest {{win in the}} Virginia Lottery's {{history to}} date {{occurred}} on February 20, 2004, when retired truck driver J. R. Triplett of Winchester won a Mega Millions <b>jackpot</b> worth $239 million. Nine Mega Millions jackpots and one Powerball <b>jackpot</b> have been won in Virginia so far.|$|E

40|$|This {{report was}} {{commissioned}} by Gambling Research Australia (GRA) to {{examine the impact of}} EGM <b>jackpots</b> on player behaviour. Specifically, the research was devised to answer the question: “Do <b>jackpots</b> and linked <b>jackpots</b> increase the likelihood of risky gambling behaviour and gambling related harm, and to what extent do <b>jackpots</b> enhance the player experience?” A $ 250, 000 project budget funded research activities from November 2011 to December 2013. This report documents those activities, including summaries of: •Past literature related to the behavioural influences of EGM <b>Jackpots</b> • 3 experiments examining the motivating influence of common structural features of <b>jackpots,</b> including accumulation methods and payout mechanics • 1 experiment examining ‘jackpot expiry’, which is a new proposed player protection feature •An observational study that explores the influence of <b>Jackpots</b> on EGM gambling in real pubs and clubs in both Queensland and New South Wales [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive <b>Jackpot</b> wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The <b>jackpot</b> started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the <b>jackpot,</b> a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the <b>jackpot,</b> regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
5|$|Legler {{held the}} record {{for well over a}} year. As 2000 ended and 2001 began, the {{producers}} of Millionaire decided that it had been too long (71 games over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won, and instituted an accumulating <b>jackpot</b> which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a <b>jackpot</b> of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating <b>jackpot</b> that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the <b>jackpot</b> was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have answered his $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 <b>jackpot.</b> On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the final question for $10,000,000.|$|E

Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time {{over the next four years}} in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E
5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK <b>jackpot</b> win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E

During the episode, a technical error occurred during the final <b>jackpot</b> round of the show's Wilyonaryo segment which raised allegations within the media that the segment was, or could be, rigged by the producers. The incident prompted {{an investigation by the}} country's Department of Trade and Industry, and was also the catalyst of an on-air feud between Revillame and Joey de Leon, a personality from the rival GMA Network.|$|E
