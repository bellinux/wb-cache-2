5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high.

Although the boom of the mid-16th century <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> <b>the</b> town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E

He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44s.

5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in {{financial}} crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E

Attempts to complete and edit the opera were made by Ukrainian composer Mykhailo Verykivsky. Composer Myroslav Skoryk and poet Diodor Bobyr used the musical material of the unfinished opera to make a one act operetta; this premiered in 1977 at the Kiev State Opera and Ballet Theatre, one hundred years after Leontovych's birth. The North American premiere took place in Toronto on April11,2003.|$|E

5|$|Burgmeier's first {{role with}} Basel {{was to play}} in the Uhrencup as they {{defeated}} German-side FC Köln 2–1, to share the trophy with Zürich. Basel <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> previous season as runners-up in the league to Zürich on goal difference and so qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Burgmeier made his Basel debut in the competition as they defeated Kazakhstan's Tobol 3–1 on 13 July, before he was replaced by Scott Chipperfield. The second leg ended in a draw, sending Basel through. The second qualifying round draw gave Burgmeier a chance to return to Vaduz. He was a substitute in both games as his new team won on away goals. They went on to qualify for the group stages, in which they finished bottom of their division, with two points from four games. Burgmeier scored his first goal for his new club in a 4–2 away defeat against Sion, but again the side only ranked in the Championship behind Zürich, this time by one point. Their disappointment was offset by an extra time victory over Luzern in the final of the Swiss Cup.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wild}} card round of the playoffs, the Giants hosted Atlanta Falcons and won 24–2, with the Falcons' only score from a safety due to Eli Manning being flagged for {{grounding}} in the end zone. In the divisional round, the Giants were forced to play the defending champion Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field. The Packers <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> regular season with a league-best 15-1 record, including a 38-35 win against the Giants in Week 13. In addition, the Packers received a first-round bye, and thus this was their first playoff match. Despite these obstacles, the Giants handily defeated the Packers 37-20 {{to qualify for the}} NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers. With the score tied 17-17 in regulation, the Giants moved into field goal range in overtime and Lawrence Tynes, the hero of the 2007 postseason, kicked a 20-yard field goal to send them to Super Bowl XLVI, a rematch against the New England Patriots.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less at risk of bombing. Its musical department, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The concerts continued through air raids, and audiences often stayed in the hall until early morning, with musical entertainments continuing after the concerts <b>had</b> <b>finished.</b> <b>The</b> season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7 September 1940. On 8 December doors and windows of the hall were blown out by blast. After temporary repairs, concerts were continued; after further damage on 6 April 1941 repairs were again quickly made, and the hall re-opened within days.|$|E

5|$|Organised league {{football}} {{had been}} {{played in the}} West Riding of Yorkshire since 1894 in the West Yorkshire League, but no side from the county had played in the Football League. So on 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the Bradford Observer, met with Football Association representative John Brunt at Valley Parade, {{the home of the}} city's rugby league side Manningham Football Club, to discuss establishing a Football League club within Bradford. In May, Manningham's committee decided to swap codes from rugby to association football and so the Football League decided to invite Bradford City to join their league in a bid to introduce association football to the West Riding, the main sport in which was rugby league. The League voted in favour of replacing Doncaster Rovers, who <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> 1902–03 season in 16th position in the Second Division, with Bradford City even though Bradford had yet to play a single game.|$|E

The production closed on January 25, 2009, after over 1,500 performances. The touring production returned to Chicago for a special engagement at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from December 1, 2010 to January 23, 2011. In celebration of the musical's 10th anniversary, the tour played an eight-week return engagement, returning to the Oriental Theatre, from October 30 through December 21, 2013.|$|E
5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season {{in exactly the same}} way they <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary in the final two rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E
