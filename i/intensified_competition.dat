25|$|There {{were two}} major {{developments}} that <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> in Fulmer's market.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of more advanced states and <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> between them spurred {{on the development}} of advanced galleys with multiple banks of rowers. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the Mediterranean powers developed successively larger and more complex vessels, the most advanced being the classical trireme with up to 170 rowers. Triremes fought several important engagements in the naval battles of the Greco-Persian Wars (502–449 BC) and the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), including the battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, which sealed the defeat of Athens by Sparta and its allies. The trireme was an advanced ship that was expensive to build and to maintain due its large crew. By the 5th century, advanced war galleys had been developed that required sizable states with an advanced economy to build and maintain. It was associated with the latest in warship technology around the 4th century BC and could only be employed by an advanced state with an advanced economy and administration. They required considerable skill to row and oarsmen were mostly free citizens who had years of experience at the oar.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} the rivers Mersey and Irwell should be made navigable from the Mersey Estuary {{in the west to}} Manchester in the east was first {{proposed}} in 1660, and revived in 1712 by the English civil engineer Thomas Steers. The necessary legislation was proposed in 1720, and the Act of Parliament for the navigation passed into law in 1721. Construction began in 1724, undertaken by the Mersey & Irwell Navigation Company. By 1734 boats [...] "of moderate size" [...] were able to make the journey from quays near Water Street in Manchester to the Irish Sea, but the navigation was only suitable for small ships; during periods of low rainfall or when strong easterly winds held back the tide in the estuary, there was not always sufficient depth of water for a fully laden boat. The completion in 1776 of the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> for the carriage of goods. In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an Act to allow the construction of a ship canal between the mouth of the River Dee and Manchester at a cost of £1million, but [...] "the necessary forms not having been observed", it did not become law. In 1844 ownership of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation was transferred to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to The Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1.112million. The navigation had by then fallen into disrepair, its owners preferring instead to maintain the more profitable canal; in 1882 the navigation was described as being [...] "hopelessly choked with silt and filth", and was closed to all but the smaller boats for 264 out of 311working days.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{capitalist}} world economy, globalisation <b>intensifies</b> <b>competition</b> everywhere, {{both within and}} between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle {{with each other to}} provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.|$|R
30|$|The missing {{number of}} ACKs {{sometimes}} is not {{contributed to the}} losses of data packets but due to the conflict of data packets and ACKs in the channel in multi-hop wireless networks. ACKs from destination nodes will <b>intensify</b> <b>competition</b> to some extent, which also degrades TCP throughput.|$|R
30|$|First, {{imports and}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) as well as trade in technology serve as channels of technology diffusion. Second, imports, FDI and technology licensing contribute to <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition,</b> which can affect incentives for innovation. Third, exports can affect innovation as {{it serves as a}} learning opportunity and gives incentives for innovative activities [35].|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{the hotel}} served as lodging for {{servicemen}} who were stationed at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa. In the 1970s and 1980s, the aging hotel {{began to decline}} as changing travel patterns and <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> from newer beach-front motels caused significant losses.|$|E
50|$|The 1980s {{began with}} <b>intensified</b> <b>competition.</b> To {{cut costs and}} improve service, Essilor {{purchased}} four new plants in four years, in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Thailand. In France, new instruments facilitated the automation of the manufacturing process. Many distributors were acquired or merged with Essilor in Europe (Norway, Portugal) and in Asia (Burma, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam).|$|E
50|$|Events {{such as the}} Berlin Airlift, the {{detonation}} of {{the nuclear}} weapons by the Soviet Union, and {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War helped Melpar's business. In addition to military applications, technology began {{to play a role in}} nonmilitary areas. The US government had a pool of technical talent in its laboratories, and assumed an expanded role. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 further <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> with the Soviet Union.|$|E
40|$|Fresh waters cover < 1 % of the Earth’s surface, yet host around 10 % {{of known}} animal species. This {{biodiversity}} {{is threatened by}} a combination of factors, exacerbated by the position of rivers and lakes as landscape “receivers. ” Climate change will <b>intensify</b> <b>competition</b> for water with humans, causing further declines in freshwater biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a two-period {{model in which}} duopolists sell experience goods and practice behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD). We give general conditions for when firms should offer a lower price to existing customers (`pay-to-stay') or to new customers (`pay-to-switch'). We also demonstrate that unlike previous results, BBPD may <b>intensify</b> <b>competition</b> {{in the first period}} but weaken it in the second...|$|R
5000|$|Lost Planet 3 sold 27,503 PlayStation 3 copies on {{the first}} week of being on sale in Japan, the lowest sales debut out of the {{numbered}} installments of the series. Reporting on its fiscal year, Capcom described the game's sales as [...] "below expectations", [...] "due in part to <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> in the European and US markets".|$|R
50|$|On top of it, <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> started eating into Piltel's {{wireless}} market subscriber share. In 1998, competitors {{using the}} GSM standard started promoting {{the use of}} SMS, which has since become the most preferred communication method of the Filipinos. Before Piltel {{had the chance to}} add SMS facilities to its CDMA network, it was already deep into the red with Php4.1 billion worth of losses as of end-1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, with Glamorgan's batting much improved, {{the county}} rose to eighth and Mercer's superb bowling - highlighted by eight for 39 against Gloucestershire and {{the dismissal of}} Somerset for 59 and 77 on a sticky wicket at Cardiff Arms Park - put him in {{second place in the}} averages and won him a Cricketer of the Year nomination from Wisden in a year when an Ashes tour <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> for the honour.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} the Caravelle, {{which had been}} fashionably styled at launch, was looking dated, while the {{reduction}} and elimination of internal tariffs within the Common Market led to <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> in France for buyers of inexpensive sports cars, notably from Italy. [...] Between 1966 and 1967 annual production tumbled from 4,880 to 2,991. During 1968 only 1,438 were produced, and {{it was during the}} summer of that year that Renault withdrew the Caravelle.|$|E
50|$|By 1990, the {{construction}} of factory complexes to make ethylene-based products in the South Korea and Thailand was expected to increase supplies and reduce prices. In the long term, the Japanese petrochemical industry is likely to face <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> {{as a result of}} the integration of domestic and international markets and the efforts made by other Asian countries to catch up with Japan.|$|R
50|$|Accumulated {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} financial access promotes growth for enterprises through the provision of credit to both new and existing businesses. It benefits the economy in general by accelerating economic growth, <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition,</b> as well as boosting demand for labor. The incomes {{of those in the}} lower end of the income ladder will typically rise hence reducing income inequality and poverty.|$|R
25|$|In open-access {{resources}} {{like fish}} stocks, {{in the absence}} of a system like individual transferable quotas, the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who want to increase catch to do so effectively by taking someone else' share, <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition.</b> This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there was}} no further free land for {{development}} in the Christian Quarter. In the same period, the Suez Canal had opened and many Christians travelled to the Holy Land. This led to <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> between the European powers for influence in Jerusalem. France built hospitals, a monastery, and hostels for visitors outside the Old City adjacent to the Christian quarter - an area which became known as the French area. The Russians located themselves in the nearby Russian Compound.|$|E
50|$|Dominica's small {{manufacturing}} sector {{is almost entirely}} dependent on agriculture, and the island has built {{up a handful of}} successful industries specializing in soaps and other agricultural byproducts. The largest manufacturer is Dominica Coconut Products, controlled by Colgate-Palmolive, which produces soap from coconuts. The factory has an agreement to sell an estimated 3 million bars of soap each year to Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Dominican soap is also exported throughout the region, but has recently encountered <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> from other regional producers, especially in the important export markets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|The {{rising costs}} {{and fall in}} profits were largely {{attributed}} to the <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> with John Jacob Astor and the HBC and the disruptions in the European market caused by the French Revolution. At first the NWC had collaborated with Astor, to avoid the East India Company's monopoly, and they shared {{some of the same}} trade routes to China. Over time, American pressure at their shared Pacific trading post on the mouth of the Columbia River was applied to the NWC in a subtle but systematic fashion, and to retain his freedom, McGillivray contemplated negotiating with the East India Company.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, IAG {{share price}} has fallen 9% since it {{reported}} its interim result. The insurer's net {{profit for the}} six months to December fell 10% to $579m due to <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> and a jump in natural disaster claims.Disaster claims of $421m exceeded the company's expectations by $71m, mainly on account of $165m in claims following Brisbane's November hail storm - the worst seen in 30 years.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, amid <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> {{as other}} Japanese and foreign banks consolidated, Sumitomo {{announced}} its merger with Sakura Bank to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The merger was approved in June 2000 and combined Sakura's strong retail operation and eastern Japan presence with Sumitomo's strong wholesale operation and western Japan presence. The merger created the world's third-largest banking {{group at the}} time, after Deutsche Bank and the pending merger that would form Mizuho Bank.|$|R
5000|$|The Reichstag {{election}} of September 1930 transformed the country's political landscape, with the National Socialist ("Nazi") party increasing {{its share of}} the popular vote from 2.6% to 18.3%, which under the country's multi-party system left it as the second largest party in the Reichstag. Right wing extremism was suddenly mainstream and at the Berliner Tageblatt the publisher's proprietor, Hans Lachmann-Mosse, who had taken over from his father-in-law, mandated a turn towards the right for the newspaper. [...] The business was also in financial trouble thanks to poorly timed investment decisions and <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> from the by now openly anti-Semitic Hugenberg Group.|$|E
50|$|After 1913, Danish cinema {{began to}} lose its leading {{foothold}} in the film industry, with foreign companies having <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> {{in the production of}} feature-length films. Danish cinema had also begun to suffer from a lack of imagination and a willingness to take creative risks on the part of Danish producers. Independent producer Benjamin Christensen had great success with the spy film Det hemmelighedsfulde X (The Mysterious X or Sealed Orders, 1914) and the crime drama Hævnens Nat (Blind Justice or The Night of Revenge, 1916), both of which are major works {{in the history of the}} Danish cinema; he would later direct several films in Sweden and Hollywood.|$|E
5000|$|Recent contractions in the {{availability}} {{of public and private}} research funding have <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> for fewer resources among universities. This trend has amplified the need for research development assistance and interventions at universities in order to enhance research excellence and competitiveness. [...] These services have not traditionally been offered through university-sponsored research and projects offices that administer the submission of grant proposals and research funds management. In response to these challenges, research development is increasingly becoming a standard practice at universities, particularly research universities (defined, by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, as universities that place a high priority on research and rely heavily on extramural funding).|$|E
30|$|Zopounidis and Doumpos (2002) found that, {{during the}} last decades, the {{globalization}} of financial markets, the <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> among firms, financial institutions, and organizations {{as well as the}} rapid economic, social, and technological changes have led to increasing uncertainty and instability in the financial and business environments. Zopounidis et al. (2015) argued that the increasing complexity and volatility of the global financial system determined the increasing use of sophisticated analytic techniques for analyzing financial data and supporting financial decisions.|$|R
40|$|The {{coming of}} the Single European Market in 1992 is <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> among leading cities for investment, jobs and services. The {{deployment}} of information technology {{is central to the}} profound structural changes that are affecting Europe's cities as a result. In this Comment the author surveys the range of strategies being developed to boost the local economy and public service provision. Government action will be necessary, he warns, to offset the potential intensification of social and regional disadvantage. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{delivery of}} medical services may be pursued by <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> among health care insurers. This paper develops {{a model of}} regulated competition among health care insurers. It shows that increasing competition may foster efficiency-raising activities, reduce insurer profits and lower health care costs. However, it may also increase the variability of consumer premiums and increase risk-type specific selection activities by insurers as the government will generally lack information on the risk characteristics of the insured. ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} major {{developments}} that <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> in Fulmer's market.Firstly, {{organizations such as}} Harwell, which had been fully government funded, were seeking contracts from industry to make good their declining government income.Secondly by 1969, following the Robbins Report(1963) on higher education, nine completely new universities had been founded and the ten existing Colleges of Advanced Technology had been converted into full universities.Robbins found that in the existing universities, teachers spent {{a third of their}} time on teaching and rather less than a third on research.He recommended that [...] "The balance between teaching and research in the universities should in general be maintained."The net effect was a huge expansion of R&D facilities in universities, funded by their block grants, and they were naturally keen to supplement their incomes with contracts using these facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Alaska Airlines also faced {{increased}} competition from low-cost carriers. One carrier that competed with Alaska was MarkAir. Since it began operating in 1984, competition {{had been reduced}} because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline {{in the fall of}} 1991, it <b>intensified</b> <b>competition</b> with Alaska. The airline offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; {{for the first time in}} 20 years, it posted a loss of [...] million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth [...] billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.|$|E
50|$|All {{these events}} only <b>intensified</b> <b>competition.</b> When Thomas Douglas {{convinced}} his fellow shareholders in the Hudson's Bay Company to grant him the Selkirk Concession, it marked {{another in a}} series of events that would lead to the demise of the North West Company. The Pemmican Proclamation, the ensuing Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, and its violence, resulted in Lord Selkirk arresting William McGillivray and several North West Company proprietors. He ordered the seizure of their outpost property in Fort William and charged them in the deaths of 21 people at Seven Oaks. Although this matter was resolved by the authorities in Montreal, {{over the next few years}} some of the wealthiest and most capable partners began to leave the North West Company, fearful of its future viability. The form of nepotism within the company too had changed, from the strict values of Simon McTavish to something that was harming the business in both its costs and morale of others.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} peak-load pricing by duopolists that maximize profit (not social welfare). We compare price levels and profits across peak-load versus uniform pricing regimes. Our main {{result is that}} the introduction of peak-load pricing can plausibly reduce prices by making price competition more severe and thereby reducing profits. This result suggests that competing firms may engage in collusion by not committing to peak-load pricing. Therefore, from the regulator's perspective, it will be desirable to encourage firms to engage in peak-load pricing to <b>intensify</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|R
