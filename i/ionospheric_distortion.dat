Their morphologies are sometimes very laterally extensive, parabolic or hyperbolic, and apparently deep, but they can also appear horizontal and shallow. Aided by a geological map of the Ma'adim Vallis region, the morphological, locational and temporal characteristics of the reflections have been studied individually in an attempt to constrain their origin. While some may be subsurface reflections based on their shallow morphologies and correlation with the Eridania Planitia basin network, all of the reflections are ambiguous to some degree, displaying characteristics that do not allow a definite subsurface- or possibly ionospheric-sourced mechanism to be proposed for their creation.

Two major propagation delay distortion sources are considered: the ionosphere and multipath. Initial analysis shows that the ionospheric delay errors can be reduced to being comparable to the receiver impairments (when the error due to multipath is low) and the maximum multipath error (under low <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions)</b> can be reduced to half a meter. Under extremely high <b>ionospheric</b> delay <b>distortions,</b> the multipath delay error envelope, with the proposed technique, will suffer no change in the magnitude of the error except that the spatial characteristics are different. The underlying idea of the proposed technique is that difference in the phase delays of the E 5 a and E 5 b signal tracking is simply the slope of the phase response over the entire band and hence represents the group delay at the E 5 center frequency of 1191. 795 MHz. The group delay which appears as the code phase error for the E 5 signal tracking, can thus be compensated except for the occurrence of higher order errors. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{accuracy}} of L-band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) differential interferometry (InSAR) on crustal deformation studies is largely compromised by ionosphere path delays on the radar signals. The ionosphere effects cause severe <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion</b> such as azimuth streaking and long wavelength phase distortion similar to orbital ramp error. Effective detection and correction of ionospheric phase distortion from L-band InSAR images are necessary to measure and accurately interpret surface displacement. In this paper, we investigate the performance im-provement of L-band InSAR interseismic deformation measure-ments in southern California through the joint correction of both ionosphere noise and orbital error. Our results show that this method can effectively remove orbit and ionosphere phase distor-tions. In comparison with in situ GPS measurements, the achieved InSAR measurement accuracy is improved from ∼ 30 mm to ∼ 10 mm by the proposed joint correction method. We show that, after the joint correction, the remaining atmosphere noise can be further mitigated through stacking, leading to an RMS error of ∼ 4. 7 mm/year in resultant line-of-sight velocity, as com-pared with ∼ 11. 3 mm/year before the correction. Our results demonstrate that the proposed joint correction technique provides a promising way to jointly correct orbital and ionospheric artifacts in L-band InSAR studies of crustal deformation.

40|$|The use of L-band InSAR {{data for}} observing the surface {{displacements}} caused by earthquakes {{can be very}} beneficial. The retrieved signal is generally more stable against temporal phase decorrelation with respect to C-band and X-band InSAR data, such that fault movements also in vegetated areas can be observed. Also, due to the longer wavelength, larger displacement gradients occurring particularly close to the ruptures can be measured. A serious draw back of L-band data {{on the other hand}} is that it more strongly reacts to heterogeneities in the ionosphere. The spatial variability of the electron content causes spatially long wavelength trends in the interferometric phase, distorts the surface deformation signal therefore impacts on the earthquake source analysis. A well-known example of the long-wavelength distortions are the ALOS- 1 InSAR observations of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. To mitigate the effect of ionospheric phase in the modelling of earthquake sources, a common procedure is to remove any obvious linear or quadratic trend in the displacement data that may have been caused by ionospheric phase delays. Additionally, remaining trends may be accounted for by including so-called ambiguity (or nuisance) parameters in the modelling. The introduced <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion,</b> however, is only approximated arbitrarily by such simple ramp functions with the true ionospheric phase screen unknown. As a consequence, either a remaining ionospheric signal may be mistaken for surface displacement or, the other way around, long-wavelength surface displacement may be attributed to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion</b> and is removed. The bias introduced to the source modelling results by the assumption of linear or quadratic ionospheric effects is therefore unknown as well. We present a more informed and physics-based correction of the surface displacement data in earthquake source modelling by using a split-spectrum method to estimate the ionospheric phase screen superimposed to the interferogram. This method is based on the dispersive nature of the ionosphere and separates the ionospheric component of the interferometric phase from the non-dispersive component related to topography, ground motion, and tropospheric path delay. We study the ionospheric bias on the fault modelling results in a real-data case study of a non-complex earthquake rupture using the ionospheric phase screen estimations and the uninformed ramp removal in comparison. The test earthquake is the March 24 2011 Myanmar earthquake (Mw 6. 8), which is covered by ALOS- 1. Here, the coseismic interferograms of both ascending and descending tracks show significant ionospheric distortions. We use the standard formulations of rectangular dislocations in an elastic half-space and run fully non-linear optimizations of the first-order fault parameters. We complement the optimization with a Bayesian model parameter uncertainties estimation to quantify the modelling bias in source model estimation with arbitrarily trend-corrected L-band displacement data compared to the correction based on the estimated ionospheric phase screen.

Here we explore one aspect of this new type of ionospheric measurement, the differential refraction of celestial source pairs as a function of their angular separation. This measurement probes variations in the spatial gradient of the line-of-sight total electron content (TEC) to 0. 001 TECU/km accuracy over spatial scales of under 10 km to over 100 km. We use data from the VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS; Cohen et al. 2007, AJ 134, 1245), a nearly complete 74 MHz survey of the entire sky visible to the Very Large Array (VLA) telescope in Socorro, New Mexico. These data comprise over 500 hours of observations, all calibrated in a standard way. While ionospheric spatial structure varies greatly from one observation to the next, when analyzed over hundreds of hours, statistical patterns become apparent. We present a detailed characterization of how the median differential refraction depends on source pair separation, elevation and time of day. We find that elevation effects are large, but geometrically predictable and can be "removed" analytically using a "thin-shell" model of the ionosphere. We find significantly greater ionospheric spatial variations during the day than at night. These diurnal variations appear to affect the larger angular scales to a greater degree indicating that they come from disturbances on relatively larger spatial scales (100 s of km, rather than 10 s of km).

40|$|We {{describe}} an improved method {{to estimate the}} Total Electron Content (TEC) of the Mars ionosphere from the echoes recorded by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) (Picardi et al., 2005; Orosei et al., 2015) onboard Mars Express in its subsurface sounding mode. In particular, we demonstrate that this method solves {{the issue of the}} former algorithm described at (Cartacci et al., 2013), which produced an overestimation of TEC estimates on the day side. The MARSIS signal is affected by a phase distortion introduced by the Mars ionosphere that produces a variation of the signal shape and a delay in its travel time. The new TEC estimation is achieved correlating the parameters obtained through the correction of the aforementioned effects. In detail, the knowledge of the quadratic term of the phase distortion estimated by the Contrast Method (Cartacci et al., 2013), together with the linear term (i. e. the extra time delay), estimated through a radar signal simulator, allows to develop a new algorithm particularly well suited to estimate the TEC for solar zenith angles (SZA) lower than 95 ° The new algorithm for the dayside has been validated with independent data from MARSIS in its Active Ionospheric Sounding (AIS) operational mode, with comparisons with other previous algorithms based on MARSIS subsurface data, with modeling and with modeling <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion</b> TEC reconstruction.

40|$|Low {{frequency}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) configurations {{play an important role}} in monitoring forests and ice sheets on global scales. They provide the ability to image systematic large areas at high spatial and temporal resolution, while at the same time they allow to penetrate into the forest and ice volume providing information about the vertical structure of such media. However, at lower frequencies spaceborne SAR measurements are affected by the presence of the ionosphere, i. e., a dispersive, anisotropic and spatial as well as temporal inhomogeneous partial plasma, located in the upper part of Earth's atmosphere. The ionospheric layer is characterised by an anisotropic (spatial and/or temporal) variation of the refractive index that affects intensity, polarisation as well as (phase and group) velocity of the transmitted and received SAR pulses passing through. In consequence, the amplitude and phase of the finally obtained (complex) SAR images are distorted impacting intensity, polarimetric and interferometric SAR measurements. The ionosphere can be characterised in terms of the Total Electron Content (TEC), which stands for the integrated number density of the free electrons along the propagation path. A consistent theoretical framework, required for describing the ionospheric impact (by means of TEC) on intensity, polarimetric and interferometric SAR observables, has been established in this thesis that allows to reveal the interconnection between the ionospheric impact on the individual elements of different SAR observation spaces. A variety of techniques have been developed and proposed to compensate the effects, induced by the ionosphere by estimating the distortion on a single SAR image parameter (e. g. focus, contrast, geometry, or polarimetric signature) and correcting the associated SAR observable. Common to all these techniques is the fact that only the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion</b> on a (small) subset of the available observation space is considered, while the remainder of the redundant and synergetic information is ignored. As a result, the achieved performance depends strongly on the ionosperic conditions as well as on the SAR system parameters. In this thesis an innovative integrated ionospheric compensation approach, that maximizes the exploited information, has been developed. An accurate high (spatial) resolution TEC map is obtained by combining the distortion estimates of a larger set of conventional, polarimetric and/or interferometric image parameters that is then used to compensate the ionospheric impact with in-creased accuracy and robustness across the whole observation space. This leads to optimized correc-tion results for a wide range of ionospheric conditions (including scintillations) and SAR system parameters. The proposed methodology has been implemented and assessed by means of a large set of single image or interferometric quad-polarimetric ALOS-PALSAR data and simulated BIOMASS P-band data covering a wide range of ionospheric conditions. The achieved performance is critically analysed and discussed in terms of ionospheric conditions and system or data parameters and then projected on different spaceborne SAR scenarios...|$|E

These observations detect strong signals such as S wave and surface waves (Kouba, 2003; Larson et al., 2003; Irwan et al., 2004; Ohta et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2007; Davis and Smalley, 2009; Shi et al., 2010), as well as relatively weaker seismic phases such as P waves (Avallone et al., 2011). Seismic phases arriving later than surface waves have been rarely reported. Although it has been confirmed that arbitrarily large seismic signals are recorded with high-rate GPS (Bock et al., 2004), we assess here the lower limit of signals from earthquakes that can be recovered from high-rate GPS records. Benefits of exploiting high-rate GPS in earthquake source studies include the ability to detect arbitrarily large dynamic ground motions that do not clip {{in the presence of}} strong ground motion and accurate recording of ground displacements without needing to doubly integrate acceleration records of strong-motion seismometers (Graizer, 2010). As a result, high-rate GPS records are now routinely used in studies of earthquake source parameters and rupture process independently of, or jointly with, seismological observations (Miyazaki et al., 2003; Ji et al., 2004; Bilich et al., 2008; Yokota et al., 2009; Avallone et al., 2011; Yue and Lay, 2011; Bock et al., 2011; Crowell et al., 2012). Though whole waveforms of high-rate GPS records have been employed in modeling earthquake source processes, it is not certain whether the wiggles following surface waves are true ground-motion signals or contamination from GPS signal propagation effects such as multipath or <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortion.</b> Accordingly, very few phases following the arrival time of surface waves have been confirmed on high-rate GPS records, primarily because of the inherently lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Identification and retrieval of the weaker secondary arrivals from high-rate GPS records would further confirm capability of GPS in recording ground motions, and thus lead to improved broadband seismograms via collated GPS and seismometers (Bock et al., 2011). Among the later arrivals, the seismic phase ScS is expected to be strong due to the complete reflection at the core–mantle boundary between the solid mantle and the liquid outer core where shear waves disappear. Moreover, ScS is far behind surface waves at close distances (less than 20 °) where contamination of the surface-wave coda is weak. Here, we present a record section of seismograms retrieved from high-rate GPS from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake wherein we observe a weak but coherent seismic phase that we associate with ScS.

Therefore, we conclude that joint observations of ASKAP with other multi-view sites using "cluster-cluster" techniques would improve the outcomes of the high spatial resolution component of ASKAP applied to astrometric projects, achieving higher precision for many more targets, and with lower detection thresholds. Also very wide-field VLBI mapping becomes a possibility. Looking to the future, this would {{contribute to the development of}} new techniques that are relevant for future high resolution observations with the SKA.

40|$|Low-frequency radio {{astronomy}} {{is limited by}} severe <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions</b> below 50 MHz and complete reflection of radio waves below 10 - 30 MHz. Shielding of man-made interference from long-range radio broadcasts, strong natural radio emission from the Earth's aurora, {{and the need for}} setting up a large distributed antenna array make the lunar far side a supreme location for a low-frequency radio array. A number of new scientific drivers for such an array, such as the study of the dark ages and epoch of reionization, exoplanets, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, have emerged and need to be studied in greater detail. Here we review the scientific potential and requirements of these and other new scientific drivers and discuss the constraints for various lunar surface arrays. In particular we describe observability constraints imposed by the interstellar and interplanetary medium, calculate the achievable resolution, sensitivity, and confusion limit of a dipole array using general scaling laws, and apply them to various scientific questions. Whichever science is deemed most important, pathfinder arrays are needed to test the feasibility of these experiments in the not too distant future. Lunar low-frequency arrays are thus a timely option to consider, offering the potential for significant new insights into a wide range of today's crucial scientific topics. This would open up one of the last unexplored frequency domains in the electromagnetic spectrum. Comment: 36 pages, many figures, accepted for publication by New Astronomy Review...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} {{are set to}} measure the 21 -cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The common denominator of these experiments are the large data sets produced, contaminated by various instrumental effects, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions,</b> RFI and strong Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. In this paper, {{the first in a}} series, we present the Data Model that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) EoR Key Science Project (LOFAR EoR KSP). Using this data model we simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band, taking properly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions (e. g. direction-dependent gains, complex gains, polarization effects, noise, etc). We then apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense, assuming that the calibration errors are random Gaussian variates at a level consistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the LOFAR Core Station 1. Our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric measurement affect the quality of the calibrated data, how errors correlate and propagate, and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies. We present results of these simulations and the inversion process and extraction procedure. We also discuss some general properties of the coherency matrix and Jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration problem of aperture synthesis arrays. We conclude that even in the presence of realistic noise and instrumental errors, the statistical signature of the EoR signal can be detected by LOFAR with relatively small errors. A detailed study of the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental models will be considered in the future. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|The active {{broadband}} (1 kHz- 100 MHz) tripole antenna now envisaged to {{be placed}} on the European Lunar Lander located at the Lunar South Pole allows for sensitive measurements of the exosphere and ionosphere, and their interaction with the Earths magnetosphere, solar particles, wind and CMEs and studies of radio communication on the moon, that are essential for future lunar human and science exploration. In addition, the lunar South pole provides an excellent opportunity for radio astronomy. Placing a single radio antenna in an eternally dark crater or behind a mountain at the south (or north) pole would potentially provide perfect shielding from man-made radio interference (RFI), absence of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions,</b> and high temperature and antenna gain stability that allows detection of the 21 cm wave emission from pristine hydrogen formed after the big bang and into the period where the first stars formed. A detection of the 21 cm line from the moon at these frequencies would allow {{for the first time a}} clue on the distribution and evolution on mass in the early universe between the Epoch of Recombination and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A single lunar radio antenna would also allow for studies of the effect of solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) on the solar wind at distances close to earth (space weather) and would open up the study of low frequency radio events from planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, which are known to emit bright (kJy-MJy) radio emission below 30 MHz (Jester & Falcke, 2009). Finally, a single radio antenna on the lunar lander would pave the way for a future large lunar radio interferometer; not only will it demonstrate the possibilities for lunar radio science and open up the last unexplored radio regime, but it will also allow a determination of the limitations of lunar radio science by measuring the local radio background noise.

40|$|Ionospheric {{propagation}} {{effects can}} have {{significant impact on}} the signal properties of low-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. Recently, theoretical analyses of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions</b> in low-frequency SAR signals have indicated a multitude of effects that are likely to affect the quality of SAR, interferometric SAR (InSAR), and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data [1 - 6]. Methods have been developed that are able to detect ionospheric effects in SAR data {{on a wide range of}} spatial scales and allow high resolution ionospheric mapping with high accuracy [3], [4], [7]. NASA’s Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission carries a spaceborne L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multiple polarizations to provide information on solid earth deformation, terrestrial vegetation structure, and ice dynamics. Besides providing improved performance and reliability of SAR for monitoring surface deformation, the L-band carrier frequency provides a means for mapping properties of the ionosphere with high spatial resolution and unprecedented spatial coverage. This paper describes the performance and benefits of DESDynI for ionospheric mapping. Specifically, we quantify the type, sensitivity, and accuracy of ionospheric measurements derived by a DESDynI-like system. We also analyze the achievable spatial and temporal sampling of ionospheric constituents at different areas on the globe and assess the value of the derived information for specific ionospheric research topics. After summarizing the physical origin of ionospheric signals in SAR data, Section 2 introduces several methods for extracting ionospheric information from DESDynI data. For each method, information on the measurement principle is provided and the range of extractable ionospheric parameters is determined. A first concept for an optimized ionospheric processor is shown that extends the performance of existing technology by maximizing the exploited information and increasing estimation robustness. An error analysis of the presented technology is shown in Section 3, where achievable accuracies of ionospheric measurements are analyzed for different retrieval methods. In Section 4 the benefit of SAR-based ionospheric data for ionospheric research is evaluated. In examples we examine its value for analyzing turbulent ionospheric processes in polar and equatorial regions, and for evaluating the structure of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) at various spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Galileo {{is a civil}} space based {{navigation}} system that will provide positioning and timing services with different levels of accuracy, integrity and availability. In combination with tropospheric delay and multipath, wave propagation effects in the ionosphere reduce the performance of Galileo. Since the used L-band signals may suffer ionospheric range errors up to about 100 meters, a proper modelling and mitigation of propagation effects is required. Whereas multi-frequency users take benefit of the dispersive nature of the ionosphere, single frequency users will apply an ionospheric model to estimate the range error for correction. Combining the phase measurements at two different frequencies, ionospheric range errors may be first-order corrected. For achieving full gain of the high precision GALILEO service, higher order propagation effects {{have to be taken}} into account. Due to the availability of more than two frequencies, new options of mitigating higher order effects exist. As learned from GPS, small scale irregularities of the electron density in the ionosphere may cause severe degradation of L-band signal strength causing occasionally loss of lock. Consequently, the signal availability is reduced. Localized severe spatial gradients and rapid changes of ionization may violate ionospheric error bounds in space based augmentation systems such as the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) or local Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS). Safety of Life (SoL) applications require reliable detection of ionospheric threats, otherwise loss of system integrity results. To reliably detect <b>ionospheric</b> <b>distortions</b> as required by the system is a challenging task for ionospheric scientists in monitoring, modelling and predicting the ionospheric behaviour. Fortunately, GALILEO itself offers new opportunities for monitoring and studying ionospheric effects in an unprecedented matter. In combination with dual frequency signals transmitted by other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS and GLONASS, the number of available data increases enormously both for ground and space based sounding techniques. Besides the high precision of GALILEO signals also the availability of a third frequency offers new possibilities for improved estimation of the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere. The high potential for ionospheric sounding by GNSS techniques is demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|The ionospheric {{delay of}} global {{navigation}} satellite systems (GNSS) signals typically is compensated {{by adding a}} single correction value to the pseudorange measurement of a GNSS receiver. Yet, this neglects the dispersive nature of the ionosphere. In this context we analyze the <b>ionospheric</b> signal <b>distortion</b> beyond a constant delay. These effects become increasingly significant with the signal bandwidth and hence more important for new broadband navigation signals. Using measurements of the Galileo E 5 signal, captured with a high gain antenna, we verify that the expected influence can indeed be observed and compensated. A new method to estimate the total electron content (TEC) from a single frequency high gain antenna measurement of a broadband GNSS signal is proposed and described in detail. The received signal is de facto unaffected by multi-path and interference because of the narrow aperture angle of the used antenna which should reduce the error source of the result in general. We {{would like to point}} out that such measurements are independent of code correlation, like in standard receiver applications. It is therefore also usable without knowledge of the signal coding. Results of the TEC estimation process are shown and discussed comparing to common TEC products like TEC maps and dual frequency receiver estimates...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} dispersion equation for electromagnetic waves in a hot magnetized collisionless plasma has shown that, in a current-free <b>ionospheric</b> plasma, the <b>distortion</b> of the electron distribution function reproducing the downward flow of a thermal electron component and the compensating upward flow of the suprathermal electrons, which {{are responsible for the}} resulting heat flux, can destabilize quasi-electrostatic ion sound waves. The numerical analysis, performed with ion densities and electron temperature taken from the data recorded by the Interkosmos- 24 (IK- 24, Aktivny) satellite, is compared with a VLF spectrum registered at the same time on board. This spectrum shows a wide frequency band emission below the local ion plasma frequency. The direction of the electron heat flux inherent to the assumed model of VLF emission generation is discusse...|$|R
40|$|Detecting and {{characterizing the}} Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn via the redshifted 21 -cm hyperfine line of neutral {{hydrogen}} will revolutionize {{the study of}} the formation of the first stars, galaxies, black holes and intergalactic gas in the infant Universe. The wealth of information encoded in this signal is, however, buried under foregrounds that are many orders of magnitude brighter. These must be removed accurately and precisely in order to reveal the feeble 21 -cm signal. This requires not only the modeling of the Galactic and extra-galactic emission, but also of the often stochastic residuals due to imperfect calibration of the data caused by <b>ionospheric</b> and instrumental <b>distortions.</b> To stochastically model these effects, we introduce a new method based on `Gaussian Process Regression' (GPR) which is able to statistically separate the 21 -cm signal from most of the foregrounds and other contaminants. Using simulated LOFAR-EoR data that include strong instrumental mode-mixing, we show that this method is capable of recovering the 21 -cm signal power spectrum across the entire range k = 0. 07 - 0. 3 h cMpc^- 1. The GPR method is most optimal, having minimal and controllable impact on the 21 -cm signal, when the foregrounds are correlated on frequency scales ≳ 3 MHz and the rms of the signal has σ_ 21 cm≳ 0. 1 σ_noise. This signal separation improves the 21 -cm power-spectrum sensitivity by a factor ≳ 3 compared to foreground avoidance strategies and enables the sensitivity of current and future 21 -cm instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array to be fully exploited.
