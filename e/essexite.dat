A vast literature is devoted to the structural position of Late Pliocene–Quaternary volcanism of this region. The geological structural position of earlier Late Miocene–Early Pliocene volcanogenic formations remains much less studied. Discovered among the latter are a few occurrences of alkaline-subalkaline rocks that differ sharply from typical island arc formations [12]. They are situated in a region with mafic [V. I. Shul’diner et al., 1981] continental crust and gravitate toward the western flank of the Eastern Kamchatka volcanic belt, which part of the modern island arc system. The well-known solitary occurrence on the eastern flank of the belt in the immediate vicinity of the seismic focal zone [13] has been supplemented by new finds [14, 15, 16]. The occurrences are represented by flows, nappes, and sills of alkaline and subalkaline basalt confined to the basal terrigenous portion of the Late Miocene–Quaternary volcanogenic cross section and also comagmatic subvolcanic dikes, sills, and small stocks of teschenites, <b>essexites,</b> camptonites, and trachydolerites, which are bedded among older sequences of the island arc accretion basement and comprise the root feeder system of volcanic structures [4, 14...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pyroxene}} {{content is}} mostly clinopyroxene, generally augite, but {{small amounts of}} orthopyroxene may also be present. If the amount of orthopyroxene is more than 95% of the total pyroxene content (5% or less clinopyroxene content), then the rock is termed norite. On the other hand, gabbro has more than 95% of its pyroxenes {{in the form of}} the monoclinic clinopyroxene/s. Intermediate rocks are termed gabbro-norite. The calcium rich plagioclase feldspar (labradorite-bytownite) and pyroxene content vary between 10-90% in gabbro. If more than 90% plagioclase is present, then the rock is an anorthosite. If on the other hand, the rock contains more than 90% pyroxenes (often both are present), it is termed pyroxenite. Gabbro may also contain small amounts of olivine ("olivine gabbro" [...] if substantial amount of olivine is present), amphibole and biotite. The quartz content in gabbro is less than 5% of total volume. 'Quartz gabbros' or monzogabbros are also known to occur, for example the cizlakite at Pohorje in northeastern Slovenia, and are probably derived from magma that was over-saturated with silica. <b>Essexites</b> represent gabbros whose parent magma was under-saturated with silica, resulting in the formation of the feldspathoid minerals nepheline, cancrinite, and sodalite as accessory minerals rather than quartz. (Silica saturation of a rock can be evaluated by normative mineralogy). Gabbros contain minor amounts, typically a few percent, of iron-titanium oxides such as magnetite, ilmenite, and ulvospinel.|$|R
40|$|Monchique is a {{sizeable}} subvolcanic?laccolith, unusual among alkaline complexes in invading sediments and lacking apparent connection with either rifting or orogeny; it may however {{relate to the}} opening of the North Atlantic (age = 76 m. y.). The intrusion is predominantly miaskitic syenite, varying irregularly from foyaite to pulaskite with fine-grained nepheline-poor margins but showing no rhythmic or cryptic layering. Minor rock-types include early masses of olivine-free kaersutite-theralites (berondrites) and <b>essexites,</b> bodies of igneous breccias, malignite and agpaite, veins of foyaite-pegmatite and shonkinite, and dykes of lamprophyres and peralkaline tinguaite. Coeval dykes outside the main intrusion include quartz-trachytes, normal (olivine-bearing) basanites and amphibole—picrites. The whole suite may have derived from a basanitic parent under moderately oxidizing conditions. Geochemistry is apparently continuous along the trend Berondrite-Essexite-Foyaite (Malignite) -Pulaskite-Quartz trachyte. As far as Foyaite this parallels the normal oceanic basanite-phonolite trend with major and trace elements and minerals (except olivine) behaving as in normal fractionation; the absence of nepheline-monzonites, creating a Daly Gap, may merely reflect high fractionation efficiency. The apparent evolution across the thermal barrier in Ne-Ks-Qtz, with a reversal in some major element trends, however, can be explained neither by fractionation nor country-rock assimilation. The enigmatic pulaskites cannot be related directly to the foyaites but might have formed from the same parent under lower pressure conditions; they themselves fractionated to the peralkaline tinguaites. The quartz-trachytes probably originated where foyaite magmas lost alkalis to the siliceous country-rocks, became oversaturated, and then fractionated feldspars. Liquid immiscibility might explain some anomalous monzonitic rocks but otherwise contributed little to the evolution of the complex...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Specimens of {{trachyte}} {{obtained on}} a recent visit to the Kaiserstuhl are compared with similar potassium-rich rocks from carbonatite complexes in Africa. Two new chemical analyses are given, in which the values for alkalis (Na 20 1 - 21, K~O 12 - 63; Na 20 0. 92, K 20 12. 18 %) are of interest. I N April 1965, the author was privileged to visit West Germany on an interchange scheme sponsored by the British Council, and was able to examine some of the classic areas of alkaline igneous activity associated with the Rhine graben. The Kaiserstuhl represents a dis-sected volcano of Miocene age, situated {{in that part of the}} graben where Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments are down-faulted between the pre-dominantly crystalline massifs of the Vosges and the Schwarzwald. The complex has been mapped and described in detail in recent years by Wimmenauer (1957, 1959 a, 1959 b, 1959 c, 1962 a, 1962 b, 1963, 1966) and the results of further studies by a team of workers have been pub-lished by Euratom (van Wambeke, 1964). Volcanic rocks, which are preserved on the flanks of the complex, comprise tephrites, tephritic agglomerates and phonolitic tufts, lim-burgite, and subordinate nephelinite. In the central part of the complex, intermittent exposures in the thick blanket of loess reveal an intrusive complex consisting of a variety of <b>essexites</b> with phonolites, and an area of carbonatite that occupies approximately 1 Km 2. The intrusive silicate rocks of the centre in many places form dyke-complexes, but several bosses or plugs of phonolite penetrate the intrusive centre, the volcanic rocks of the flanks, and the surrounding sediments. The carbonatite occurs as a number of apparently contiguous diapiric bodies emplaced in the silicate rocks of the centre.

50|$|The subvolcanic and {{intrusive}} rocks {{of the central}} Kaiserstuhl are plutonic equivalents of the erupted material (<b>essexite,</b> carbonatite and coarse-granular phonolite). Several local terms which do not carry official status with the International Union of Geological Sciences {{have been used for}} different varieties of the {{intrusive rocks}}. Of major scientific interest is the consolidated carbonatite near Altvogtsburg und Schelingen. It is a quite rare volcanic rock, which crystallized from a carbonate magamatic melt rather than a silicate one. Given its unusual composition for an igneous rock, the magmatic nature of the carbonatite was not proposed {{for a long time and}} remained doubtful subsequently. An alternative interpretation was that it was a metamorphically altered sedimentary rock, examples of which can be found nearby. Only in the 1950s and 1960s did research prove that it was a carbonatite; one of the clues was identification of the eruptive carbonatites found in the western part of the Kaiserstuhl. The carbonatite contains the niobium rich pyrochlore; attempts to mine the carbonatite rock for niobium were carried out in the middle of the 20th century, but the amount turned out to be too small to be economical.|$|E
50|$|Rocks of {{this class}} also occur in Brazil (Serra de Tingua) {{containing}} sodalite and often much augite, {{in the western}} Sahara and Cape Verde Islands; also at Zwarte Koppies in the Transvaal, Madagascar, São Paulo in Brazil, Paisano Pass in West Texas, United States, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The rock of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, is a mica-foyaite rich in albite and aegirine: it accompanies granite and <b>essexite.</b> Litchfieldite is another well-marked type of nepheline-syenite, in which albite is the dominant feldspar. It is named after Litchfield, Maine, United States, where it occurs in scattered blocks. Biotite, cancrinite and sodalite are characteristic of this rock. A similar nepheline-syenite is known from Hastings County, Ontario, and contains hardly any orthoclase, but only albite feldspar. Nepheline is very abundant {{and there is also}} cancrinite, sodalite, scapolite, calcite, biotite and hornblende. The lujaurites are distinguished from the rocks above described by their dark color, which is due to the abundance of minerals such as augite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and other kinds of amphibole. Typical examples are known near Lujaur on the White Sea, where they occur with umptekites and other very peculiar rocks. Other localities for this group are at Julianehaab in Greenland with sodalite-syenite; at their margins they contain pseudomorphs after leucite. The lujaurites frequently have a parallel-banding or gneissose structure. Sodalite-syenites in which sodalite very largely or completely takes the place of nepheline occur in Greenland, where they contain also microcline-perthite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and eudialyte.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of glacial erratics derived from two small, adjacent, distinctive outcrops of essexlte near Lennoxtown, Central Scotland. Analysis of till samples has revealed that rock fragments and sand-size particles of <b>essexite</b> are absent up-ice of the <b>essexite</b> outcrops and scarce in a down-ice direction. Using dry stone walls as random samples of glacially transported stones, classic erratics train patterns {{of the distribution of}} erratics from both outcrops have been derived. The close spacing of Joints on one outcrop has led to the rapid disappearance of its erratics in the walls with distance from the source due to glacial crushing. Crushing is also shown by a size reduction of erratics from the other outcrop in the walls in a down-ice direction. Measurement of size and morphometric properties of <b>essexite</b> erratics has revealed that crushing is the dominant and abrasion a subsidiary process in glacial transport, whilst abrasion is dominant for particles that have undergone fluvioglacial and beach transport. Roundness appears to be the best measure differentiating between processes acting in the glacial, fluvioglacial and beach environments. Tests of compressive strength and experimental abrasion of <b>essexite</b> have been carried out to aid interpretation of the results. Tlll-particle preferred orientations, striae and the long axes of ice-moulded features snow a similar direction to that of the major axis of the train. From the evidence available it is suggested that the <b>essexite</b> wall stones underwent englacial transport in the lower layers of the last active ice and were deposited as an ablation mantle. A position of transport {{at the base of the}} ice is invoked for <b>essexite</b> particles in the till. The lateral spreading of <b>essexite</b> erratics down-ice of the source is attributed to divergence of basal ice flow around subglacial obstacles...|$|E
