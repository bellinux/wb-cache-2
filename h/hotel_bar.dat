It quickly established a reputation for luxury, with clients including royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway, who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the <b>hotel,</b> <b>Bar</b> Hemingway, is devoted to Hemingway. L'Espadon is a world-renowned restaurant, attracting aspiring chefs {{from all over the world}} who come to learn at the adjacent Ritz-Escoffier School.

25|$|On April 3, 2009, Scottish {{football}} players Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor were permanently {{banned from the}} Scottish national squad for showing the V sign while {{sitting on the bench}} during the game against Iceland. Both players were in their <b>hotel</b> <b>bar</b> drinking alcohol after the Scottish defeat to The Netherlands until around 11am the next morning, meaning that both of the players breached the SFA discipline code before the incident as well, but the attitude shown by the V sign was considered to be so rude that the SFA decided never to include these players in the national line-up again. Ferguson also lost the captaincy of Rangers {{as a result of the}} controversy. McGregor's ban was lifted by then SFA manager Craig Levein and he returned to Scotland national squad in 2010.|$|E
