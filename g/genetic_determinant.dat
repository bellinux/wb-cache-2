50|$|As the {{extracellular}} {{concentration of}} 5-HT is {{regulated by the}} activity of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), the gene SLC6A4 encoding this protein represents an important potential candidate gene for AD risk. Using a meta-analysis approach, Feinn et al. found evidence for an association of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) with AD, but the overall effect size estimated by odd ratios was found weak. As expected in a complex condition like alcohol dependence, the disagreement in the association between AD and 5-HTTLPR likely reflects the impossibility for a single <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> to explain the whole of the risk.|$|E
5000|$|In 1896, Patrick and Gilbert {{observed}} that during {{a prolonged period}} of sleep deprivation, sleepiness increases and decreases with a period of approximately 24 hours. In 1918, J.S. Szymanski showed that animals are capable of maintaining 24-hour activity patterns {{in the absence of}} external cues such as light and changes in temperature. In the early 20th century, circadian rhythms were noticed in the rhythmic feeding times of bees. Extensive experiments were done by Auguste Forel, Ingeborg Beling, and Oskar Wahl to see whether this rhythm was due to an endogenous clock. Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer isolated the first clock mutant in Drosophila in the early 1970s and mapped the [...] "period" [...] gene, the first discovered <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> of behavioral rhythmicity. Joseph Takahashi discovered the first mammalian circadian clock mutation (clockΔ19) using mice in 1994. However, recent studies show that deletion of clock does not lead to a behavioral phenotype (the animals still have normal circadian rhythms), which questions its importance in rhythm generation.|$|E

50|$|Interested in the {{mechanism}} by which LPS activates mammalian immune cells, Beutler used TNF production as a phenotypic endpoint to identify the LPS receptor. Identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning of the mammalian Lps locus, which had been known since the 1960s as a key <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> of all biological responses to LPS. Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals, demonstrating {{that one of the}} mammalian Toll-like receptors, TLR4, acts as the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex. The TLRs (of which ten are now known to exist in humans) are now widely known to function in the perception of microbes, each detecting signature molecules that herald infection. These receptors also mediate severe illness, including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection. They are central to the pathogenesis of sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011.The positional cloning of Lps was completed in 1998. Beutler thereafter continued to apply a forward genetic approach to the analysis of immunity in mammals. In this process, germline mutations that alter immune function are created through a random process using the alkylating agent ENU, detected by their phenotypic effects, and then isolated by positional cloning. His work disclosed numerous essential signaling molecules required for the innate immune response, and helped to delineate the biochemistry of innate immunity.|$|E

An hly-specific probe (plasmid pAN 215) was used to detect homologous fragments in the strains analyzed by the Southern blotting technique. It was found that all 10 strains contain sequences that hybridize against the probe (greater than 85 % homology) and thus contain hly genetic determinants very similar to those found on Hly plasmids.

The mutants are still partially sensitive to chloramphenicol and have a lowered growth rate, compared to the wild type strain, in rich medium without chloramphenicol. The genetic analysis described here indicates that chloramphenicol resistance is inherited as a cytoplasmic determinant that is not exchanged during conjugation.

Both the pattern and the level of fecal excretion of the cVDPV strains resemble those of wild-type poliovirus type 1.

40|$|PSORS 1, near HLA-C, is {{the major}} <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> of psoriasis. We present genetic and {{structural}} evidence suggesting a major role for the HCR gene at the PSORS 1 locus. Genotyping of 419 families from six populations revealed that coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms of HCR formed a conserved allele HCR*WWCC that associated highly significantly with psoriasis and with the HLA-Cw 6 allele in all populations. Because of strong linkage disequilibrium between HLA-Cw 6 and HCR*WWCC, the two genes could not be genetically distinguished by this sample size. However, the variant HCR allele was predicted to differ in secondary structure from the wild-type protein. HCR protein expression in lesional psoriatic skin differed considerably from that observed in normal skin. These results provide strong evidence for the HCR*WWCC allele as a major <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> for psoriasis, probably by a mechanism impacting on keratinocyte proliferation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis, titled ‘Genetic and pharmacogenetic {{determinants}} of cardiovascular disease’ is divided in three sections. In section one the <b>genetic</b> <b>determinants</b> of coronary restenosis are explored. In the first genome-wide association study on this condition, in the <b>GENetic</b> <b>DEterminants</b> of Restenosis study, we describe a novel locus on chromosome 12 possibly associated with restenosis. Furthermore, by using several analysis tools on this data, we describe multiple biological pathways and genes {{that are likely}} associated with restenosis. In section two, we focus on genetic factors involved in three other (cardio) vascular diseases. We explore the role of DNA repair genes in myocardial infarction and stroke and the <b>genetic</b> <b>determinants</b> of dialysis shunt failure. Section three is on pharmacogenetics. In particular, {{we were interested in}} genetic variation involved in aspirin and clopidogrel resistance. We validated two genetic polymorphisms associated with recurrent thrombotic events during treatment with these agents in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. Genetic research is a fast developing field of research. By increasing our knowledge on the molecular background of diseases, genetics potentially could lead to more personalized treatment in the near future. Promotor: J. W. Jukema, Co-promotor: S.

40|$|Abstract: The {{progression}} of HIV disease has been markedly slowed {{by the use}} of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, substantial genetic variation was observed to occur among different people in the decay rate of viral loads caused by HAART. The characterization of specific genes involved in HIV dynamics is central to design personal-ized drugs for the prevention of this disease, but usually cannot be addressed by experimental methods alone rather than require the help of mathematical and statistical methods. A novel statistical model has been recently developed to detect genetic variants that are responsible for the shape of HAART-induced viral decay curves. This model was employed to an HIV/AIDS trial, which led to the identification of a major <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> that triggers an effect on HIV dynamics. This detected major <b>genetic</b> <b>determinant</b> also affects several clinically important parameters, such as half-lives of infected cells and HIV eradication times...|$|E
