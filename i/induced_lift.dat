Although several firms expressed interest in production of the design, all failed to provide sufficient funds. In 1965, Custer and the Custer Channel Wing corporation were convicted of contempt of court for continuing to sell shares of the company after a 1962 SEC injunction. The CCW-5 continued to make development flights during the 1960s and 1970s, but no production orders were obtained. In 1978 Custer filed a $80 million suit against the designers of the A-10 for using his idea of <b>induced</b> <b>lift</b> from {{the proximity of the}} engines to the wings. The suit was dismissed.|$|E
5000|$|... d) Starting flow {{at large}} {{angle of attack}} for wings with sharp leading edges. If, as for a flat plate, the leading edge is also sharp, then {{vortices}} also shed {{at the leading edge}} and the role of leading edge vortices is two-fold：(1) they are lift increasing when they are still close to the leading edge, so that they elevate the Wagner lift curve,(2) they are detrimental to lift when they are convected to the trailing edge, inducing a new trailing edge vortex spiral moving in the lift decreasing direction. For this type of flow a vortex force line (VFL) map [...] can be used to understand the effect of the different vortices in a variety of situations (including more situations than starting flow) and may be used to improve vortex control to enhance or reduce the lift. The vortex force line map is a two dimensional map on which vortex force lines are displayed. For a vortex at any point in the flow, its lift contribution is proportional to its speed, its circulation and the cosine of the angle between the streamline and the vortex force line. Hence the vortex force line map clearly shows whether a given vortex is lift producing or lift detrimental. [...] e) Lagally Theorem. When a (mass) source is fixed outside the body, a force correction due to this source can be expressed as the product of the strength of outside source and the induced velocity at this source by all the causes except this source. This is known as the Lagally theorem.For two-dimensional inviscid flow, the classical Kutta Joukowski theorem predicts a zero drag. When, however, there is vortex outside the body, there is a vortex induced drag, in a form similar to the <b>induced</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{induced drag}} of non-planar wings is {{compared}} to that of planar wings which result from unfolding the non-planar ones. It is shown that due to the <b>induced</b> <b>lift,</b> there exist non-planar configurations with positive span camber that have an overall aerodynamic performance increase in comparison to the planar ones. The <b>induced</b> <b>lift</b> and increment of aerodynamic performance increases with decreasing aspect ratio. The effect is opposite for configurations with negative camber. Without the <b>induced</b> <b>lift,</b> the positive non-planar configuration would have more induced drag. Analysis is performed using a lifting line method, which takes into account the <b>induced</b> <b>lift,</b> and using Euler solutions. For the inviscid solutions, the induced drag is obtained with a far-field drag analysis method. ...|$|E

Then the Coandă effect sucks the air flow along the bent wall, sucks down ambient air and creates a low pressure area on top of the device, <b>inducing</b> <b>lift.</b> This is how the Aerodina Lenticulara works, a device patented by Henri Coandă, whom Petit met in these days.

40|$|Lifting {{line and}} Euler {{techniques}} {{have indicated that}} an elliptical planform cambered in the spanwise direction {{appears to have a}} lower induced drag than the uncambered, planar configuration, when both of then have identical arc lengths and the same wetted areas. In other words, a wing geometry with a lower projected span than the planar wing, only because of spanwise cambering, has been found to have a lower induced drag than the corresponding planar case. It was also noted that in the Euler solutions the theoretical minimum induced drag was not achieved on a planar configuration without applying a twist distribution. The increased efficiency of the non-planar configuration is due to <b>induced</b> <b>lift</b> and without accounting for this <b>induced</b> <b>lift,</b> the induced drag is larger then that of the corresponding unfolded planar wing. <b>Induced</b> <b>lift</b> and aerodynamic efficiency of the spanwise cambered configuration was observed to increase with reduced aspect ratio...|$|E

Its use is summarized. The new summarized method, represents the first step toward the use of surface pressure data in an empirical method, as opposed to just balance data in the current method, for calculating jet induced effects. Although the new method is currently limited to flat plate configurations having two circular jets of equal thrust, it has the potential of more accurately predicting jet induced effects including a means for estimating the pitching moment in hover. As this method was developed from a very limited amount of data, broader applications of the method require the inclusion of new data on additional configurations. However, within this small data base, the new method does a better job in predicting jet induced effects in hover than the current method...|$|E

For small tip-speed ratios, the rotor receives a corotating torque mainly {{due to the}} difference of the drag on both the blades. As the tip-speed ratio increases, a Coanda-like flow pattern is formed on the convex side of an advancing blade, and the corotaing torque is expected by the <b>induced</b> <b>lift,</b> though the torque due to the difference of the drag decreases.

40|$|A segregation-dispersion model able {{to predict}} the coal and mineral {{separation}} achieved using a continuous steady state fluidized bed system incorporating inclined channels was developed. This system, {{referred to as a}} Reflux Classifier (RC), consists of a lamella settler and a fluidization section below. The feed suspension enters the unit, passing into the inclined channels, segregating onto the inclined surfaces, before sliding back towards the fluidization section. Lower density particles report to the overflow, and denser particles to the underflow. A significant breakthrough {{in the development of the}} RC was established in 2008 when closely spaced inclined channels were introduced (~ 6 mm), promoting a new laminar-shear mechanism. This arrangement led to the selective shear <b>induced</b> <b>lift</b> of low density particles, thus the separation performance increased significantly following 2008. This paper describes the first major step towards developing a segregation-dispersion model of the above mentioned system. As a first step, the effects of the laminar-shear mechanism in the inclined channels have been neglected, and therefore the results have been validated using the experimental work for widely spaced channels prior to 2008. A total of 35 species were used in the simulations, corresponding to 5 different sizes with 7 densities per size for a particle size range of - 2. 0 + 0. 25 mm. Partition curves for particles of a given size have been determined, achieving excellent agreement with the published data in terms of D 50 and Ep values.

The basic modeling assumption is that the vehicle is propulsed via a thrust force along a single body-fixed direction {{and that it has}} full torque actuation for attitude control (i. e., a typical actuation structure for aircrafts, Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles, submarines, etc.). Additional assumptions on the external forces applied to the vehicle are also introduced for the sake of control design and stability analyses. They are best satisfied for vehicles which are subjected to an external force field (e. g., gravity) and whose shape <b>induces</b> <b>lift</b> forces with limited amplitude, unlike airplanes but {{as in the case of}} many VTOL drones.
