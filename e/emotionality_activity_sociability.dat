50|$|Some {{research}} has investigated whether {{the relationship between}} happiness and extraversion seen in adults {{can also be seen}} in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable {{over the course of a}} lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality. Whereas McCrae and Costa's Big Five model assesses personality traits in adults, the EAS (emotionality, activity, and sociability) model is used to assess temperament in children. This model measures levels of <b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability,</b> and shyness in children. The personality theorists consider temperament EAS model similar to the Big Five model in adults; however, this might be due to a conflation of concepts of personality and temperament as described above. Findings show that high degrees of sociability and low degrees of shyness are equivalent to adult extraversion, and also correlate with higher levels of life satisfaction in children.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{childhood}} temperament, particularly negative emotionality (high {{tendency to}} show distress), {{may be a}} risk factor for subsequent depression. METHODS: Using data from a large UK cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), we examined the association between temperament on the <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Sociability</b> Questionnaire at age 6 and ICD- 10 depression at 18. Results were adjusted for a range of confounders. RESULTS: Children with high emotionality scores at age 6 had a 20 % (7 - 36 %) increase in the odds of being diagnosed with depression at age 18.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the development of BPD symptoms across adolescence by evaluating the fit of several latent variable growth models to annual assessments of symptoms obtained from girls when they were ages 14 through 19 years. After determining the best fitting model, we examined prospective associations between the temperament dimensions of <b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity,</b> low <b>sociability,</b> and shyness and BPD symptom development. METHODS: We utilized longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study; one of the few large-scale, prospective studies of girls (N = 2, 450) in the United States. Parent- and teacher-reports of girls' temperament were collected at Wave 1, when girls were ages 5 - 8 years. Child-reports of BPD symptoms were collected annually beginning at age 14 through 19 years. RESULTS: We found that a free curve slope intercept model provided the best model fit, with the course of BPD symptoms characterized by a large component of inter-individual stability and a smaller component representing within-individual changes across adolescence. Symptoms appeared to peak by age 15, decline through age 18, and remain steady between ages 18 and 19 years. Both parent- and teacher-reports of temperament <b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity,</b> low <b>sociability,</b> and shyness predicted the developmental course of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: BPD symptoms in adolescence reflect trait-like differences between youth with less within-person variability across time. Childhood temperament dimensions of <b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity,</b> low <b>sociability,</b> and shyness predict adolescent BPD symptom development. Parent- and teacher-informants provide unique information about the course of BPD symptoms, underscoring the utility of collecting child assessments using multiple informants...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore the relationships between autistic traits and tem-peramental characteristics in the framework of the Regulative Temperament Theory by Strelau, and the <b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity</b> and <b>Sociability</b> theory by Buss and Plomin, with par-ticular emphasis on gender differences. The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Formal Char-acteristics of Behaviour – Temperament Inventory and Temperament Survey for Adults were administered. The participants were 593 university students, including 364 females and 229 males. Results showed positive correlations between autistic traits and Emotional Reactivity, Perseveration, Distress, Fear and Anger, and negative correlations with Activity, Briskness, Endurance and Sociability. The results of multiple regression analyses involving the Autism Spectrum Quotient score as a dependent measure were different for females and males. Results of exploratory PCA analysis showed that AQ score, Sociability and Ac-tivity loaded one factor (with AQ loading being opposite to two others). High AQ scorers demonstrated higher Emotional Reactivity, Perseveration, Distress and Anger, and lower Briskness, Endurance, <b>Activity</b> and <b>Sociability</b> as compared to norms for the general popu-lation. In this study we showed that temperament measures were able to identify items that correlated in parts with autistic traits, while other items were obverse.

40|$|Background: It is {{increasingly}} recognised that traits associated with autism reflect a spectrum {{with no clear}} boundary between typical and atypical behaviour. Dimensional traits are needed to investigate the broader autism phenotype. Methods and Principal Findings: Ninety-three individual measures reflecting components of social, communication and repetitive behaviours characterising autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) were identified {{between the ages of}} 6 months and 9 years from the ALSPAC database. Using missing value imputation, data for 13, 138 children were analysed. Factor analysis suggested the existence of 7 factors explaining 85 % of the variance. The factors were labelled: verbal ability, language acquisition, social understanding, semantic-pragmatic skills, repetitive-stereotyped behaviour, articulation and social inhibition. Four factors (1, 3, 5 and 7) were specific to ASD being more strongly associated with this phenotype than other co-morbid conditions while other factors were more associated with learning difficulties and specific language impairment. Nevertheless, all 7 factors contributed independently to the explanation of ASD (p, 0. 001). Exploration of putative genetic causal factors such as variants in the CNTNAP 2 gene showed a varying pattern of associations with these traits. An alternative predictive model of ASD was derived using four individual measures: the coherence subscale of the Children’s Communication Checklist (9 y), the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (91 m), repetitive behaviour (69 m) and the sociability subscale of the <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> and <b>Sociability</b> measure (38 m).

40|$|We {{investigated}} Buss and Plomin's <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Sociability</b> (EAS) Temperament Survey for Children, used {{to assess}} temperament. Temperament is believed to comprise stable traits that change little over time. We examined stability of EAS temperament in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, in which 7429 mothers completed the EAS when their children were 3, 5 and 6. years old. Factor analysis was conducted at each time point, and stability over time was assessed using correlation and mixed effects regression modelling, accounting for differences within and between individuals. A four-factor model provided the best fit, with 19 - 20 of the 20 items loading onto the dimensions predicted by Buss and Plomin. Test-retest correlations ranged from 0. 52 - 0. 64 (3 - 5. years), 0. 59 - 0. 74 (5 - 6. years) and 0. 46 - 0. 58 (3 - 6. years).

40|$|It is {{a common}} article of belief that each child is unique [...] Action based on this belief, though, is rare. Researchers have largely {{neglected}} {{the question of the}} causes of children's individual uniqueness. But, when difficulties and serious problems arise in the course of child rearing, causality is located in the dynamics of family functioning. Recent research on various problems suggests that such a narrow functionalist view of causation is inadequate and reasserts the existence and importance of individual differences and their effects. Individual differences in children have been investigated by Thomas, Chess, and Birch (1956, 1968, 1977), who identified individual characteristics of 1 -month-old infants and explored the extent to which those characteristics remained constant and influenced later psychological development. The. researchers identified three temperament styles: the easy, difficult, and slow-to-warm child.

40|$|Introduction: Acne vulgaris is {{the most}} common skin disease. This chronic skin {{disorder}} induces negative psychological and social effects such as anxiety, depression and a reduction in social functioning. Consequences of acne can be seen for many years, also in patients suffering from a self-limiting acne of adolescents. Aim of the study: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the methods of coping with stress, components of temperament and anxiety in patients with acne vulgaris. Material and methods: The preliminary study was conducted on the group of 32 patients: 27 women and 5 men, aged from 16 to 34 years with a moderate acne vulgaris. Coping Inventory for Stressful Situation (CISS) questionnaire was used to evaluate the methods of coping with stress. Anxiety was analyzed with the use of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) whereas components of temperament were assessed with EAS-D-questionnaire (<b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity</b> and <b>Sociability</b> Temperament Survey). Results: There was no difference in methods of coping with stress between acne patients and the normalization group; most commonly presented by acne patients was the task-oriented coping while the least often noticed was the avoidance-oriented coping. Analysis of temperament showed the highest rate for anger and the lowest rate for dissatisfaction but no difference between the study- and the normalisation-group was found. The acne patients achieved higher results for state- -anxiety than for trait-anxiety measured with STAI. Conclusions: Relying on the obtained results of the pilot-study could be stated that there are no differences in methods of coping with stress and analysis of temperament's components between patients with moderate acne and normalization group.

40|$|Early temperamental {{characteristics}} {{may influence}} children's developmental pathways and predict future psychopathology. However, the environmental context may also shape or interact with infant temperament and indirectly contribute to increased vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes. The {{aim of the}} present study is to explore the long-term contribution of temperamental traits at twelve months of age to the presence of emotional and behavioral problems later in childhood, and whether this association varies with the child's sex, parental separation, family socioeconomic status and maternal depression. 1184 mother-child pairs from the EDEN mother-child birth cohort study based in France (2003 - 2011), were followed from 24 - 28 weeks of pregnancy to the child's fifth birthday. Infant temperament at 12 months was assessed with the <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> and <b>Sociability</b> (EAS) questionnaire and behavior at 5. 5 years was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Emotional temperament in infancy predicts children's overall behavioral scores (β = 1. 16, p< 0. 001), emotional difficulties (β = 0. 30, p< 0. 001), conduct problems (β = 0. 51, p< 0. 001) and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention (β = 0. 31, p = 0. 01) at 5. 5 years. Infants' active temperament predicts later conduct problems (β = 0. 30, p = 0. 02), while shyness predicts later emotional problems (β = 0. 22, p = 0. 04). The association between the child's temperament in infancy and later behavior did not vary with children's own or family characteristics.

40|$|The major aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether differences concerning acceptance of dental treatment and amnesia after rectal sedation with midazolam can be explained by temperament traits in the child. Fifty children (1. 5 - 4. 0 years), consecutively referred for dental extractions because of dental trauma or caries, were sedated with midazolam 0. 3 mg kg(1) rectally. Level of sedation (state of mind) was assessed according to Wilton before and 10 min after administration of the sedative. The children's acceptance of procedures during the oral examination, the administration of the sedative, and the dental treatment were assessed according to Holst. Acceptance of an injection of local anesthesia and tooth extraction was dichotomized as satisfactory (n = 26) or unsatisfactory (n = 24). The parent assessed temperament using the <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Sociability</b> (EAS) Scale of Child Temperament. Amnesia was evaluated by the parent on the following day. The relation between temperament and outcome variables was analyzed using a multiple logistic regression analysis. Children regarded as shy by the parent were at significantly greater risk of unsatisfactory acceptance of the dental treatment (P < 0. 05). High scores of negative emotionality were significantly related to less amnesia (P < 0. 05).

Design and methods Twenty-eight β-thalassaemic major children that followed CBFT for one year were compared with twenty-eight age-matched healthy children, focusing particularly on behavioural, mood, and temperamental characteristics as well as compliance with chelation, assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), and <b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity,</b> <b>Sociability</b> and Shyness Scale (EAS). We also monitored the quality of life of caregiving mothers using the World Health Organization Quality Of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Data were analysed with non-parametric standard descriptive statistics. Results 90 % of β-Thalassaemic children showed good compliance with chelation therapy; however they had significantly increased somatic complains, physical symptoms and separation panic. Moreover, temperamental assessment revealed high emotionality and poor sociability in treated thalassaemic children and in their mothers. Physical and psychological domains concerning individual's overall perception of quality of life resulted impaired in mothers of β-thalassaemic children. Conclusion CBFT can be a valid tool to increase the compliance with chelation therapy in β-thalassaemic children; however, treated children continue to show an important emotional burden; moreover, CBFT therapy seems not to have any positive impact on the quality of life of caregiving mothers, who may therefore need additional psychological support. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic fatigue is {{a problem}} {{affecting}} a still growing number of people. Among them there are representatives of different professions who are forced to cope not only with occupational stress, {{but also with the}} problem of fatigue. The police is one of such occupational groups, in which exposure to stressful and often traumatic situations, contact with those who violate the law, shift work and contact with superiors can {{play a key role in}} the development of chronic fatigue. However, chronic fatigue, induced by the above mentioned factors, does not affect all police officers since its occurrence also depends on many personal traits, including temperament. Material and methods: We studied a group of 61 police officers of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian garrison. The study was conducted using the Buss and Plomin EAS (<b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability)</b> Temperament Questionnaire, CIS- 20 R (community, innovation, survey) Questionnaire, developed by Vercoulen et al. and a questionnaire on socio-demographic data. Results: The results indicated the relationship between chronic fatigue and emotionality. Statistical analyses showed a negative correlation between the nature of emotional components, distress, fear, anger, and the general rate of chronic fatigue. There was no statistically significant correlation between age, and service experience and the level of chronic fatigue. Conclusions: The results indicate that the officers of the study group show dramatically high levels of chronic fatigue. The results also revealed that temperament characteristics, such as sociability and activity, reported in the literature as factors reducing fatigue and stress, did not show relevance to chronic fatigue in the study group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the joint and collective contributions of student and teacher factors to observed variance in reports of conflict and closeness in first and second grade teacher-student relationships (STR). This study uses two data sets previously collected from elementary schools in the greater Pittsburgh area, to examine the association between child and teacher factors with the relationship qualities of closeness and conflict in early elementary teacher child relationships. Children from each sample were followed from 1 st to 2 nd grade (N= 96 and N= 44 respectively), and data were collected from parents and teachers, as well as through direct observation in each academic year. Parents reported on child externalizing behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, 1981), and sociability using the Buss and Plomin <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> Level and <b>Sociability</b> Inventory (EAS) (Buss & Plomin, 1984). Teachers reported on the quality of their relationship each participating student using the Student Teacher Relationship Survey (STRS) (Pianta, 2001). Additionally, observations were made of teacher classroom behavior using the Arnett Caregiver interaction scale. Child externalizing behavior and teacher sensitivity, detachment and punitiveness were tested for association with 1 st and 2 nd grade teacher reported conflict. Child sociability and teacher sensitivity, detachment and punitiveness were tested for association with 1 st and 2 nd grade teacher reported closeness. These factors were also used to predict change in teacher student relationship quality between 1 st and 2 nd grades. Results showed student externalizing behavior to be positively associated with contemporaneous relationship conflict, and teacher detachment and punitiveness to be associated inversely with contemporaneous closeness. Teacher sensitivity and student externalizing behavior interacted when predicting change in relationship conflict. Teacher sensitivity and change in teacher sensitivity both predicted change in relationship closeness. These results both replicate and extend the body of existing research on teacher student relationship quality. The association of child externalizing behavior to relationship conflict was replicated, although the observed effect size was significantly different from previous findings. The contribution of teacher classroom behavior to the prediction of variance in relationship closeness is unique to this study. Additionally, the prediction of change in relationship quality using student and teacher factors, as well as the joint contribution of each, is an extension of existing research. Results are discussed in terms of functional avoidance by the teacher and the student of difficult behaviors exhibited by each other.

40|$|This project {{examined}} childhood temperament as {{a predictor}} of substance use in early adolescence. Many previous studies of temperament and substance use were cross-sectional, and thus could not address the direction of this relationship. Previous longitudinal studies did not address childhood temperament as a risk factor for substance use. In addition, many studies only considered a small number of covariates of substance use. This study improved on previous studies by collecting childhood temperament data at ages when substance use is rare, and addressing the direction of this relationship. In addition, substance use data were collected in early adolescence and other covariates were analyzed. The data were from a longitudinal, epidemiological study of the effects of prenatal substance use, and included covariates of substance use such as maternal substance use and psychiatric symptoms, child psychiatric symptoms, and family history of substance use problems. Temperament was measured at ages 6 and 10 using the <b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity,</b> <b>Sociability,</b> and Shyness Survey (Buss & Plomin, 1984). Substance use outcomes were measured at age 14 with the Health Behavior Questionnaire (Jessor, Donovan, & Costa, 1989), which measures the quantity and frequency of substance use, including cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Increased sociability and increased activity at age 6 predicted ever having tried a cigarette by age 14. This relationship remained significant when controlling for other relevant covariates. Temperament at ages 6 and 10 did not predict alcohol, marijuana, or polysubstance use outcomes, although increased sociability did predict escalation of marijuana use. This project also identified common and unique predictors of the initiation and escalation of use of specific substances. Children with high levels of activity and sociability at age 6 are at increased risk for substance use in early adolescence. The public health importance of these findings is that parents or teachers can easily identify these traits at young ages. Prevention efforts may then be aimed at these children starting in early elementary school in the hopes of reducing and delaying the initiation of their substance use in adolescence. These results may also be used to tailor prevention and intervention efforts to use of specific substances...|$|E

This anxiety is associated with poor post-operative outcomes such as increases in emergence delirium occurrence and post-operative pain. Studies have demonstrated varying effectiveness of interventions such as clowns and video games used to engage and distract children from their anxiety. Anesthesiologists at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital have designed a new screen-based modality, called the Bedside Entertainment Theatre (BERT), to distract children from their anxiety. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the anxiety-relieving efficacy of BERT against a hand-held electronic tablet, another screen-based form of entertainment used to alleviate preoperative anxiety in children at the hospital. METHODS: Children aged 4 - 10 undergoing non-emergent outpatient surgery at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital and their primary caregiver were recruited for the study. Measures were taken at 5 timepoints from children, parents, and clinicians: in the preoperative holding area (T 1), at entrance to the OR (T 2), at induction (T 3), after emergence from anesthesia (T 4), and at a 1 -week follow up (T 5). Primary outcomes were preoperative anxiety, assessed by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) and Child Fear Scale (CFS), and induction compliance, assessed by the Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC). Secondary outcomes were emergence delirium, measured by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED) and post-operative pain, measured by the Parents’ Post-operative Pain Measure (PPPM) and a Memory Recall Interview. Child covariates were temperament, measured by the <b>Emotionality</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Sociability</b> Temperament Survey (EAS-TS) and the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire- Very Short Form (CBQ-VSF), and state-trait anxiety, measured by the Child State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAIC). Caregiver covariates were state-trait anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and caregiver pain catastrophizing about their child, measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale- Parent State (PCS-P State). This study is currently ongoing and plans to recruit 60 participants. Parent, child, and clinician satisfaction with usage of either intervention was also assessed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between mean preoperative anxiety scores of BERT and tablet users at all pre-induction timepoints. There was a significant increase in mean preoperative anxiety scores in BERT users from T 1 to T 2 and T 1 to T 3. There was also a significant increase in mean preoperative anxiety scores from T 1 to T 3 for tablet users. There were no other significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between interventions. Only post-surgery PCS-P State scores for BERT users correlated with mYPAS scores at T 3 (p 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary results do not show differences between the interventions in relieving preoperative anxiety, there may be potential insights gained in how both interventions affect anxiety at different preoperative timepoints. Statistical analysis with the full sample population will be necessary to draw stronger conclusions. 2018 - 07 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} temperament, personality, {{and problem}} behaviors {{in children with}} Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) aged 6 to 14 years. It targets differences between an ADHD sample (N = 54; 43 boys) and a large community sample (N = 465; 393 boys) in means and variances, psychometric properties, and covariation between traits and internalizing and externalizing problems. Parents rated their children on Buss and Plomin’s and Rothbart’s temperament models, a child-oriented five-factor personality model and also on problem behavior. Relative to the comparison group, children with ADHD presented with a distinct trait profile exhibiting lower means on Effortful Control, Conscientiousness, Benevolence and Emotional Stability, higher means on <b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity,</b> and Negative Affect, but similar levels of Surgency, Shyness, and Extraversion. Striking similarities in variances, reliabilities and, in particular, of the covariation between trait and maladjustment variables corroborate the spectrum hypothesis and suggest that comparable processes regulate problem behavior in children with and without ADHD...|$|R
50|$|The {{factors in}} the {{alternative}} Five model correspond to traits in Eysenck's three factor model, and to {{four of the five}} traits in the Five factor model. Neuroticism-anxiety is basically identical to neuroticism, while sociability is very similar to extraversion in the Eysenck and five factor models. Impulsive sensation-seeking is positively correlated with psychoticism from Eysenck's model, and negatively with conscientiousness in the five factor model, and {{it has been argued that}} psychopathy represents an extreme form of this trait. Aggression-hostility is inversely related to agreeableness in the five factor model. Zuckerman and colleagues noted that Activity is subsumed under extraversion in some models of personality but argued that it should be considered an independent dimension of temperament that is distinct from sociability. A later study comparing Zuckerman's model with the Five Factor model using factor analysis found that <b>Activity,</b> <b>sociability,</b> and extraversion all loaded onto a single factor, suggesting that Activity and extraversion are closely related.|$|R
40|$|Objective This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether changes in neurodevelopmental outcomes between 18 and 36  months of age were associated with prenatal exposure to triptan medications, a class of 5 -HT receptor agonists used {{in the treatment of}} migraine. Method Using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, a prospective birth cohort that includes nearly 40 % of all pregnancies in Norway from 1999 to 2008, we identified 50   469 mother–child dyads who met inclusion criteria and were present for at least one follow-up assessment at 18 or 36  months postpartum. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist, the <b>Emotionality,</b> <b>Activity,</b> and Shyness Questionnaire, and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. We used generalised estimating equations to evaluate change from 18 to 36  months for children prenatally exposed to triptans, relative to contrast groups, and used marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to address time-varying exposure and confounding as well as loss to follow-up. Results Among eligible participants (n= 50   469), 1. 0 % used a triptan during pregnancy, 2. 0 % used triptans prior to pregnancy only, 8. 0 % reported migraine without triptan use and 89. 0 % had no history of migraine. Children with prenatal triptan exposure had greater increases in emotionality (r-RR 2. 18, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 4. 53) and activity problems (r-RR 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 2. 8) compared to children born to mothers who discontinued triptan use prior to pregnancy. Conclusion Prenatal triptan exposure was associated with changes over time in externalising-type behaviours such as <b>emotionality</b> and <b>activity,</b> but not with internalising-type behaviours...|$|R
50|$|Researchers were {{interested}} in subjects {{who were in the}} later years of life. They knew that past studies suggested that genetics played a larger role in one's personality in the earlier years of their life. However, they were curious about whether or not this was true later on in life. They gathered subjects {{with a mean age of}} 59, who included 99 pairs of identical twins, and 229 pairs of fraternal twins who were all reared apart. They also gathered twins who were reared together: 160 pairs of identical twins, and 212 pairs of fraternal twins. They studied the most heritable traits in regard to personality, which are <b>emotionality,</b> <b>activity</b> level and sociability; also known as EAS. This study found that identical twins resembled each other twice as much as fraternal twins, due to genetic factors. Furthermore, environment influences personality substantially; however, it has little to do with whether they are reared together or apart. This study also suggests that heritability is substantial, but not as substantial as for younger subjects; it has less significance later on in life.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the heritability of AFFM and PEN dimensions, including 67 pairs of twins (34 monozygotic and 33 dizygotic) of both genders, aged 18 - 44. The heritability has been estimated by the biometric method, two full (ACE and ADE) and three reduced (AE, DE and CE) models tested for each personality trait. Taking into consideration the AFFM dimensions, additive genetic factors and a non-shared environment contribute the most significantly to the phenotypic variation of <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability</b> and the impulsive sensation seeking; anxiety and aggressiveness are best accounted for by the dominant genetic effects. In the PEN domain, fit indicators suggest that ACE and the reduced AE models provide the best explanation for the phenotypic manifestations of neuroticism, while ACE and CE models account for the variation of L scale. Although the fit indicators calculated for extraversion and psychotic behavior are somewhat problematic, the parameter estimates show that extraversion is best accounted for by the additive genetic variance, shared environmental effects, and the non-shared environment, whereas psychotic behavior is the most adequately explained by both shared and non-shared environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{sought to}} assess the {{influence}} of preschoolers' temperament on their objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time. Actical™ accelerometers were used to measure preschoolers' from London, Canada's (n= 216; 2. 5 – 5 years) physical activity and sedentary levels during childcare hours (5 consecutive days; 15 s epoch). The Child Temperament Questionnaire (CTQ) {{was used to assess}} child temperament via parent/guardian report. The six subscales of the CTQ (i. e., reaction to food, soothability, attention span, <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability,</b> and <b>emotionality)</b> were correlated with Actical data (i. e., sedentary time, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and total physical activity). The five items of the activity subscale were correlated with these three measures of sedentary time and physical activity. Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients were employed for both sets of analyses. Of the correlations examined, few had an absolute value greater than 0. 10, and none were statistically significant after taking multiple comparison bias into account. The results of this work might provide additional indirect support for the conclusion that the childcare environment should be a primary focus with regard to the promotion of increased physical activity and decreased sedentary time among preschoolers. Additional research is required to confirm the relationship between preschoolers' temperament and levels of physical activity and sedentary time...|$|R
50|$|Kitty is Eric and Laurie Forman's {{mother and}} the wife of Red Forman: a cheerful, sunny, sweet-natured typical {{housewife}} with a much happier, gentler personality as opposed to that displayed by her ill-tempered, wisecracking husband Red. She virtually always treats those around her sweetly and kindly and shows far more respect for the teenagers than Red does. She tries to encourage group <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability</b> and teamwork in those around her (particularly Red or anyone showing reluctance to do so at the time), and normally is seen {{with a smile on}} her face. She also harbors a love of square-dancing and overflows with powerful maternal instinct, doting on her children and always on the search for something else to nurture, such as her beloved pet dachshund Schatzi. However, Kitty also possesses a darker side; when antagonized, she has been known to be provoked into using profanity strong enough to be censored out, albeit otherwise she seldom raises her voice to other people. She also smoked frequently {{for a period of time}} before deciding to quit the habit, although when stressed she has been shown to relapse, even taking a cigarette from one of the teenagers when desperate. (This was because actress Debra Jo Rupp had tried to quit the habit in real life).|$|R
40|$|Children with {{selective}} mutism often {{present as}} a very diverse population, with both oppositional (APA, 2013; Cohan et al., 2008; Steinhausen 2 ̆ 6 Juzi, 1996), and anxious symptoms (APA, 2013; Kristensen, 2000; Vecchio 2 ̆ 6 Kearney, 2009) most commonly reported. The first aim {{of the current study}} was to validate the presence of previously identified anxious and oppositional behavior factors in a community sample of youth with selective mutism. These factors were previously identified in a clinic sample of youth with selective mutism (Diliberto 2 ̆ 6 Kearney, 2016). The second aim was to examine the association of anxious and oppositional behavior factors with specific behaviors on the CBCL consistent with activity level, social competence and social problems (Achenbach 2 ̆ 6 Rescorla, 2001). The third aim {{of the study was to}} examine temperament domains according to <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability,</b> shyness and <b>emotionality</b> in children with selective mutism. Participants included 278 mothers of youth with selective mutism aged 6 - 10 years recruited from the Selective Mutism Group and social media groups for selective mutism. Hypothesis 1 a was that previously identified anxious and oppositional behavior factors would be replicated in a community sample of children with selective mutism (Diliberto 2 ̆ 6 Kearney, 2016). Hypothesis 1 a was not supported, therefore, Hypothesis 1 b was that anxious and oppositional factors from CBCL items would be identified via exploratory and confirmatory iv factor analyses in the community sample. Findings from Hypothesis 1 b then served as the basis for the remaining hypotheses (i. e., Hypotheses 2 a+). Hypotheses 2 a- 11 a examined the association of anxious and oppositional behavior factors with CBCL activity, social competence and social problems subscale scores and specific items and EAS <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability,</b> shyness and <b>emotionality</b> subscale scores and items. Hypotheses 2 a- 11 a were only partially supported. The anxious factor was positively associated with shyness, negative emotionality and social problems, but a significant negative association was not found with activity, activity competence, social competence and sociability. The oppositional factor was associated with activity, social problems and negative emotionality, but a significant positive association was not found with activity competence, social competence, and sociability. Latent class analysis was used to determine if classes of selective mutism based on anxious, oppositional and inattention factors could be identified. A three-class model was derived: 1) highly anxious and oppositional, and moderately to highly inattentive, 2) moderately anxious and oppositional, and moderately to highly inattentive, and 3) mildly anxious, oppositional and inattentive. Further analyses were done to determine if classes were consistent with certain social competence items, and social problems, in addition specific facets of temperament. Findings provided support for classes of selective mutism based on anxious, oppositional and inattentive symptoms, and their association with specific behaviors and temperaments. Clinical implications, future directions and limitations were discussed...|$|R

The study included 65 children aged 7 – 15 and their parents. Children diagnosed as Combined or Predominantly Hyper-active Impulsive Type had significantly higher scores than those diagnosed as Pre-dominantly Inattentive Type in anxious and avoidant attachment, <b>emotionality,</b> and <b>activity</b> dimensions of temperament, and their parents {{reported higher levels of}} controlling styles. Hierarchic regressions indicated that parental promotion of autonomy with children with temperamental emotionality predicted anxious attachment, while parental restriction of autonomy with children with high levels of temperamental activity predicted avoidant attachment...|$|R
40|$|Interindividual {{differences}} in animal behaviour that are relatively consistent {{over time and}} context {{are referred to as}} animal personality. Personality has been recognized throughout the entire animal kingdom, in an array of species like molluscs, arthropods, fish, birds and mammals. The personality of non-human animals has been suggested to vary along five different axes, or continua; boldness-shyness, avoidanceexploration, <b>activity,</b> <b>sociability</b> and aggressiveness. Having a relatively fixed personality may seem nonadaptive compared to infinite behavioural plasticity so the individual would be able to respond adaptively to any changes in the environment. There can be physiological limitations to the phenotypic expressions of any trait, including behaviour. Variation in neuroendocrinology may thus explain why animals have personality. A candidate neurochemical that potentially proximately influences and forms personality, is serotonin (5 - HT), one of the most omnipotent neurotransmitter of the animal body. In the many realms of the serotonergic system, there may arise individual differences which forms a proximate basis for {{differences in}} personality. In this review paper, I discuss the impact of the serotonergic system on a few different personality traits. Depending on the individual’s motivational state, serotonin can dampen or enhance aggression. Serotonin correlates negatively to anxious traits. Feeding behaviour is affected by serotonin in seemingly opposing directions. Overall, serotonin seem to underlie many behaviours that describe animal personality...|$|R
