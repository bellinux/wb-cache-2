60|$|The flies that troubled me {{most were}} a large kind of blue-bottle or blow-fly. These settled in swarms on my bird skins when first put out to <b>dry,</b> <b>filling</b> their plumage with masses of eggs, which, if neglected, {{the next day}} {{produced}} maggots. They would get under the wings or under the body where it rested on the drying-board, sometimes actually raising it up half an inch by the mass of eggs deposited in a few hours; and every egg was so firmly glued to the fibres of the feathers, as {{to make it a}} work of much time and patience to get them off without injuring the bird. In no other locality have I ever been troubled with such a plague as this.|$|E

"'Well, they journeyed for two days, {{and then}} there came up a wind-storm, hot and <b>dry,</b> <b>filling</b> the air with sand and dust, {{so that they could}} not see where they were going, and the natives said they ought all to go back, for it was {{dangerous}} to try to keep on in such a storm. But our two men would not give up so soon, and they made a camp in a sheltered place, and determined to press on in the morning, when they might expect the storm to be over. But in the morning they found that every native had deserted them. The wind had gone down, and the fellows must have started back before it was light. Then Shirley and Burke {{did not know what to}} do. They believed that they were nearer the coast than the mountains, and as they had plenty of provisions,--for the natives had left them nearly everything,--they thought they would try to push on, for a while at least.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} flower bulbs and {{herbaceous}} perennials in consumer packages declines rapidly due to sprouting and drying out. The {{present study was}} undertaken to develop Modified Atmosphere Packages (MAP) with suitable filling materials for a prolonged shelf life of different species of flower bulbs (e. g., Lilium, Anemone, Erythronium) and herbaceous perennials (e. g., Hemerocallis, Hosta, Phlox). As filling materials peat moss and Toresa (wood fiber) were tested. So-called continuous MA films were used, i. e., without laser holes, {{which means that they}} are virtually impermeable to water. The shelf life of plants and bulbs was tested in packages produced from these films after addition of filling materials with different moisture contents. The shelf life was determined in a climate chamber at 23 °C with a high ventilation rate. The same products were packed in traditional packages with microperforation for comparison. The shelf life of bulbs and perennials was extended dramatically from 3 to 4 weeks in the traditional package with microperforation to 2 to 3 months by the use of MA packaging. It was however not the low oxygen level inside the packages that caused this effect but the reduction of water loss by using MA films. In microperforation packages the products dried out completely in 3 to 4 weeks, whereas in the MA packages the products remained turgescent and vital for 2 to 3 months. Sprouting was inhibited by using <b>dry</b> <b>filling</b> materials. The term Modified Humidity Packaging therefore seems to be more appropriate for this type of packaging. To prevent too low oxygen levels inside MA packages it is recommended to use an MA film with a high permeability for oxygen. This also enables the use of one film {{for a wide range of}} products...|$|E

40|$|This {{report by}} Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{documents}} {{results of a}} contamination source review of Building E 5032 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) in Maryland. The review included a historical records search, physical inspection, photographic documentation, geophysical investigation, and review of available records regarding underground storage tanks associated with Building E 5032. The field investigations were performed by ANL during 1994 and 1995. Building E 5032 (APG designation), originally known as Building 99, {{is located at the}} northwest comer of the intersection of Hoadley Road and Magnolia Road in the Edgewood Area of APG. It was constructed during World War I as an incendiary bomb filling plant and in 1920 s and 1930 s maintained as a filling facility. During World War II the building was a pilot plant {{for the development of a}} dry white phosphorus filling process. Since then the building has been used for white phosphorus filling pilot studies. Most of the <b>dry</b> <b>filling</b> methods were developed in Building E 5032 between 1965 and 1970. Other filling operations in Building E 5032 have included mustard during the period shortly after World War II and triethyl aluminum (TEA) during the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. During the World War II period, the building was connected to the sanitary sewer system with one large and at least one small interior sump. There are also seven sumps adjacent to the exterior of the building: two on the west elevation, four near the four bays on the south elevation, and one at the northeast corner of the building. All of these sumps are connected with the chemical sewer system and received most, if not all, of the production operation wastewater. The discharge from this system was released into the east branch of Canal Creek; the discharge pipe was located southeast of Building E 5032. There are no records indicating the use of Building E 5032 after 1974, and it is assumed that the building has been out of service since that time...|$|E
40|$|Documentation of the empiric data, {{measured}} in the heating and cooling chamber to determine the thermal constant for the investigated transport boxes. Background: The transport of veterinary drugs must comply with the general standards for drug storage. Although many vehicles are equipped with active heating and/or cooling devices assuring recommended storage conditions, simple insulated transport boxes are also often used. In this study, measurements for typical transport boxes were performed under laboratory conditions {{by the use of}} a climate chamber for a temperature of - 20 °C and 45 °C to investigate the impact of box size, insulation material, liquid vs. <b>dry</b> <b>filling</b> products, filling degree and other parameters on the thermal performance of insulated boxes. Model calculations and instructions are presented to predict the retention time of recommended drug storage temperatures. Results: The measurements and the model calculations showed that the loading of the transport boxes with additional water bottles to increase the heat capacity is appropriate to prolong the retention time of the recommended temperature range of the drugs. Insulated transport boxes are not suitable to store drugs over a period of more than approximately 12 hours. For practical use, a recipe is presented to measure the thermal properties of a transport box and the related retention time for which the recommended storage temperatures can be assured. Conclusions: The following principles for drug transportation in vehicles are recommended: (1) Before transfer into boxes, drugs should always be thermally preconditioned (2) Increase the filling degree of the boxes with thermally preconditioned water bottles or re-usable thermal packs will increase the heat capacity. Do not deep-freeze the bottles or packs below 0 °C to avoid drug freezing due to contact. (3) Open the lid of the boxes only to uncase drugs that are immediately needed. (4) The bigger the box and the higher the filling degree, the longer the retention time of the transport box. (5) Wherever possible, place the drug box at a cool site inside the vehicle. (6) The monitoring of the inside temperature of the transport boxes is recommended. By the proper use of such transport boxes the recommended temperatures can be maintained over one working day...|$|E

Several substrates such as commercial silica gel and alumina TLC plates, silica gel powder, alumina, CaSO 4, CaCO 3, BaSO 4, MgO, chalk, α-cellulose and ethyl cellulose were tested as solid substrates. 30 – 70 -mesh silica gel was finally employed in glass tubes of 4. 0 mm internal diameter.

Cows were fed typical far-off and close-up diets, a late lactation diet containing wet corn gluten feed (20 % DM), and an alfalfa hay, corn silage based early lactation diet. Ruminal measurements were obtained 72 (late lactation), 51 (far-off dry), 23 and 9 (close-up dry) days before expected parturition and 6, 20, and 34 days postpartum. Measurements included total <b>fill,</b> <b>dry</b> matter <b>fill,</b> fluid fill, and water-holding capacity of the rumen. Dry matter intake and milk production data were collected daily and body weight and body condition were determined weekly. Body weights and condition increased during the dry period, whereas intake {{as a percentage of}} body weight decreased. Ruminal water holding capacity, an indicator of rumen capacity, increased linearly from late lactation to 34 days postpartum.
