This paper draws on an in-depth study of four social impact bonds in the UK context, as the welfare regime at the vanguard of this policy development. The findings suggest that the introduction of private capital in outcome-based commissioning has had a number of unique and unintended effects on service providers, operations and outcomes.

40|$|Artículos en revistasRegulatory {{reforms of}} the {{electricity}} industry in South America have always been prompted by the need of attracting enough <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the fast-paced demand growth. In order to achieve this goal, {{the countries in the}} region which in the eighties and early nineties opted for market-oriented schemes, have rebuilt in the last decade their regulatory frameworks around long-term auctioning. These new mechanisms, initially implemented <b>to</b> attract <b>investment</b> in any sort of conventional generation technology so as to ensure the system adequacy, are also being increasingly used to bring in non-conventional renewable energy resources. These schemes have been until now run in parallel, but the steep learning curve of Renewable Energy Sources for electricity (RES-E) technologies is apparently opening the door to the implementation of new tendering procedures open to all kinds of generation technologies. In this article, we review the auction mechanisms for new generation implemented in South America. We argue that although the first impression might lead to the conclusion that conventional and RES-E technologies are in some cases close and even ostensibly competing in the same auctions, {{the fact is that the}} full convergence is still far to happen, as the rules and products applied to the different technologies differ significantly. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Due to the strong competitions among retailers, they need to find their competitive advantages in order to survive in the market. Retail environment is one element that retailer can control in order to provide good retail experience, which leads to customer loyalty. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to obtain a deeper understanding of the 21 st retail experience. In order to reach the purpose, we have chosen to do a case study on IKEA through a participant observation. The findings and conclusions indicate that sight experience is the most important for customer both in offline and online setting. For offline environment, store image especially store layout plays a big role in contributing a good retail experience. Store layout dictates the flow and image in the store and also the way retailer design the atmospherics in store such as lighting and visual communications. As a surprise, IKEA does not pay much attention on music as much as other retailers do. The way that IKEA decorates their store with their own merchandises, creates its environment as interactive theatrics. Similarly to offline environment, the web layout is important for e-shoppers to easily find their desired products and information. Website should reflect the brand at every touch point. The visual theatrical effect such as 2 D/ 3 D is very essential in order to provide the vivid experience for shoppers. Overall, every element mentioned in theories is important. However, it would be big <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> every detail.

The access is poor and would require huge <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> large parts of rural India which have no access to communications facilities. The paper proposes a framework which would require a micro level analysis of the rural areas. The paper argues that a uniform approach such as improving a universal service obligation as a part of granting regional licenses may not be workable for a large country like India. Rural areas with significant economic activity would have to be treated differently from remote and economically backward regions. A proactive policy is needed which encourages investment in infrastructure for rural areas. The nature of encouragement for different regions would have {{to be based on the}} cost of providing access; the potential for earning revenue and the institutions which can deliver a valuable service in rural areas. Finally, a case study from the context of co-operative dairy movement is presented which illustrates how rural communities can benefit from ICT (Computing and Internet access). Such communities are willing to invest in ICT, provided that real value is delivered. Lessons are drawn from the case study to understand how the information culture can be successfully spread to rural areas.

5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPortfolio {{theory has}} been {{suggested}} {{as a means to}} improve the risk–return characteristics of investments in health-care programs through diversification when costs and effects are uncertain. This approach {{is based on the assumption}} that the investment proportions are not subject to uncertainty and that the budget can be invested in toto in health-care programs. MethodsIn the present paper we develop an algorithm that accounts for the fact that investment proportions in health-care programs may be uncertain (due to the uncertainty associated with costs) and limited (due to the size of the programs). The initial budget allocation across programs may therefore be revised at the end of the <b>investment</b> period <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the extra costs of some programs with the leftover budget of other programs in the portfolio. ResultsOnce the total budget is equivalent to or exceeds the expected costs of the programs in the portfolio, the initial budget allocation policy does not impact the risk–return characteristics of the combined portfolio, i. e., there is no benefit from diversification anymore. ConclusionThe applicability of portfolio methods to improve the risk–return characteristics of investments in health care is limited to situations where the available budget is much smaller than the expected costs of the programs to be funded...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} as {{a survey of the}} effects of taxation and asymmetric information on the financing choice of the firm. The literature on taxation posits a straightforward relationship between the pretax cost of funds and the required return on an <b>investment</b> project <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the cost of finance which is a function only of tax rates. The real decisions of the firm are assumed in these analyses to be affected only by the after-tax cost of funds. The paper examines how differential taxation of retained earnings, new share issues, and debt finance affects the financing choice of the firm in the absence of asymmetric information. It examines the problems of asymmetric information that arise with external finance and the mechanisms that have been created in rural sectors of developing countries to counter the problem of asymmetric information. The final section of the paper examines policy options open to government to reduce the costs of the inefficiencies created by asymmetric information.

Methods Using a simple mathematical model informed by available behavioural and biological data and reflecting the HIV epidemiology in South Australia, we calculated the expected number of new HIV transmissions caused by persons who are not currently on ART compared with transmissions for people on ART. The extra financial <b>investment</b> required <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the copayments <b>to</b> prevent an HIV infection was compared with the treatment costs saved due to averting HIV infections. Results It was estimated that one HIV infection is prevented per year for every 31. 4 persons (median, 24. 0 – 42. 7 interquartile range (IQR)) who receive treatment. By considering the incremental change in costs and outcomes of a change in program from the current status quo, it would cost the health sector 17 860 per infection averted (median, 13 651 – 24 287 IQR) if ART is provided as a three-dose, three-drug combination without requirements for user-pay copayments. Conclusions The costs of removing copayment fees for ART are less than the costs of treating extra HIV infections that would result under current conditions.

40|$|Mixed-income {{planning}} {{has become}} the common-sense approach to public housing redevelopment in Toronto. Based on the premise of physical design dictating behaviour, social mix theory hinges {{on the idea that}} diluting the proportion of rental tenure via the supply of privately-owned units will break apart pathologies commonly accepted as being produced by concentrations of poverty. Interestingly, both the perceived benefits of social mix theory and the pathologies assumed to be produced by concentrations of poor people are empirically unfounded. However, by exercising place-making strategies that focus predominantly on the negative social and physical attributes of low-income neighbourhoods, change appears necessary and to the benefit of all involved. In this Major Paper, I will introduce the proposed Alexandra Park redevelopment as a case study of municipally-managed gentrification and mixed-income planning. The idea of a redeveloped Alexandra Park has been sparked by a progressive councillor and an involved group of residents accustomed to transformations in the governance structure of their neighbourhood. However, without the high exchange value of its prime downtown location, private investment in this economically underutilized neighbourhood would be unlikely. Aided by the territorial stigmatization of the neighbourhood and the racialization of its residents, place-making has enabled the common-sense approach to redevelopment in Alexandra Park legitimized by the concentrations of poverty thesis. It is my position that the existing residents of Alexandra Park will not reap the assumed, yet unwarranted, benefits commonly associated with socially mixing economically polarized groups of citizens. Redevelopment, instead, will lead to revalorized land that generates revenue in the form of property taxes, and a micro-segregated neighbourhood threatened by long-term gentrification processes related to increasing property values and consequent service transformations. Federal government shifts from redistributive and protective public policies to neo-liberal policies supporting growth and privatization that have occurred over the past three decades, have enabled the downloading of public housing provision from higher orders of government to fiscally austere municipalities, forcing housing providers such as Toronto Community Housing to rely upon private <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> operational costs. Consequently for the current residents, however, private investment in Alexandra Park will reduce their proportional composition to half of what it is today.
