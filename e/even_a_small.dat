5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{degree of protection}} reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between {{parts of a}} population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E

5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly {{than those of the}} south, there was a more pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|E
5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a day prior to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss explained {{that it was only}} for promotional purposes and added that the film had no such scenes, claiming that <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E

5|$|The popular {{legend of}} the Taktsang monastery is further embellished {{with the story of}} Tenzin Rabgye, who built the temple here in 1692. It has been {{mentioned}} by authors that the 8thcentury guru Padmasmabhava had reincarnated again in the form of Tenzin Rabgye. The corroborative proofs mooted are: that Tenzin Rabgye was seen (by his friends) concurrently inside and outside his cave; <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> quantity of food was adequate to feed all visitors; no one was injured during worship (in spite of the approach track to the monastery being dangerous and slippery); and the people of the Paro valley saw in the sky various animal forms and religious symbols including a shower of flowers that appeared and also vanished in the air without touching the earth.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles.|$|E

5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
