5000|$|On Saturday, 29 February 1908, three Model Ks {{from the}} 1907 Cadillac {{production}} were {{released from the}} stock of the Anglo-American Motor-car Company, the UK agent for Cadillac automobiles, at the Heddon Street showroom in London (these were engines Nos. 23391, 24111 and 24118). The three cars, all registered in London under the numbers A2EO, A3EO and A4EO, were driven 25 miles to the Brooklands race track at Weybridge. There, the cars completed ten laps of the track, or approximately 30 miles, before being locked away until Monday, 2 March 1908, when they were released and disassembled completely, using only wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers. Each car {{was reduced to a}} pile of 721 component parts, which were then scrambled into one heap by the RAC. Eighty-nine parts requiring extreme accuracy were withdrawn from the heap, locked away at the Brooklands club house and replaced with new parts from Anglo-American's showroom stock. The parts were then sorted into three piles, each with all the parts needed to assemble a car. A mechanic - Mr. E. O. Young - reassembled the cars {{with the help of his}} assistant - Mr. M. M. Gardner. Sometimes they had to work ankle-deep in water, using only wrenches and screwdrivers. The third car was re-assembled by Thursday morning, 12 March. With the painted parts on the original cars not being identical in color or style, the reassembled cars were mismatched in appearance, gaining the nickname [...] "harlequin cars". By 2 p.m. on Friday 13 March the three cars had completed the mandatory 500-mile run with singular regularity. Only one point was lost owing to a broken cotter pin in the <b>ignition</b> <b>lever</b> (promptly replaced from stock). During the event, it was reported that one of the sheds where the parts were stored became partly flooded during a heavy storm and some parts became rusted. Only oily rags could be used to remove all traces of the immersion. On completion of the test, one of the cars was locked away until the start of the 2000-miles reliability trials in June 1908. It came out the winner of the R.A.C. Trophy for its class. Parts interchangeability had been publicly demonstrated and field tested.|$|E
50|$|The new {{car with}} the 42 per cent larger engine was {{described}} in the Daily Mail newspaper in October 1912. Throttle and <b>ignition</b> <b>levers</b> are mounted {{on the top of}} the steering wheel, a foot accelerator is also being fitted. The petrol tank is mounted on the dash.|$|R
5000|$|There was a 12-volt {{electrical}} system for lighting and starting. Timing {{was at the}} back of the engine. From there on the off-side were driven in-line the generator, water-pump and magneto. Reported refinements for the 1929 Motor Show included: chromium-plated exterior fittings, Triplex glass, improved (dome type) [...] "mud wings (front mudguards) and new gas (sic) and <b>ignition</b> control <b>levers</b> [...] "neatly placed above the steering wheel". For 1930 the specification included Biflex magnetic dip and switch headlights and wire wheels.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{put into}} {{practice}} starting in 1906 on the Ford Model K. The Model K had dual ignition systems, {{one of which was}} the Holley-Huff Magneto, or Huff System, manufactured by the Holley Brothers Company. It was designed by Edward S. Huff with US patent #882003 filed July 1, 1905 and assigned to Henry Ford. The system used an engine driven DC generator that charged a capacitor and then discharged the capacitor through the ignition coil primary winding. An excerpt from the 'Motorway' Jan 11 1906, describes its use on Ford six cylinder cars: 'The efficiency of the Ford Magneto is shown {{by the fact that the}} instant it is switched in the car will pick up speed and, without changing the position of the <b>ignition</b> control <b>lever,</b> will run at least ten miles an hour faster.' ...|$|R
