5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale <b>gulper</b> sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
25|$|Shark {{have been}} fished for centuries in the Maldives. The main groups of sharks {{caught in the}} Maldives are reef sharks, deep water <b>gulper</b> sharks and ocean sharks. The reef shark fishery generates more revenue for the {{fisheries}} and tourism than the other groups. Shark fisheries continue to be exploited, particularly for export purposes.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth rate}} of the velvet belly is slow, though faster than some other deep-sea sharks, such as the leafscale <b>gulper</b> shark (Centrophorus squamosus) or the shortspine spurdog (Squalus mitsukurii). Males mature sexually at [...] long and females at [...] long. The average age at {{maturity}} is 4.0 years for males and 4.7 years for females, though four-year-old mature individuals of both sexes have {{been caught in the}} wild, along with immature females over eight years old. Males and females eight and 11 years old, respectively, have been caught in the wild; the potential lifespan of this species has been estimated at 18 years for males and 22 years for females.|$|E

50|$|Smallfin <b>gulpers</b> {{are common}} {{deepwater}} sharks. They {{live near the}} bottom between 130 and 820 m. They are ovoviviparous and have two pups per litter. Their diets are primarily bony fish, but also other sharks, molluscs, crustaceans, and even tunicates are consumed.|$|R
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., <b>gulpers</b> and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|R

Assisted by Kenta Yonesaka, Alex <b>Gulper,</b> Peter Stanislaus, Charlie Paakkari, Tim Lauber, Tom Steel, Greg Dennon and Denis St. Amand. The children {{who participated in the}} chorus were Mariah Britt, Joshua Britt, Evyn Johnson, Makiah Johnson, Mason Johnson, Delaney Meyer, Elsie Moon and Cayla Nisperos; their voices span from G3 to F♯5. Carey provided her background vocals alongside Melonie Daniels, Sharlotte Gibson, Sherry McGhee and Nicki Richards.|$|E
2500|$|After {{sitting for}} years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the {{accumulated}} sludge becomes hardened and {{is very difficult to}} remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called [...] "manual scavenging"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, <b>Gulper,</b> e-Vac).|$|E
6000|$|... "The RHYN" [...] or Rhin, is {{a little}} river, which, near its higher clearer sources, we were all once well acquainted with: {{considerable}} little moorland river, with several branches coming down from Ruppin Country, and certain lakes and plashes there, in a southwest direction, towards the Elbe valley, towards the Havel Stream; into which latter, through another plash or lake called <b>GULPER</b> SEE, and a few miles farther, into the Elbe itself, it conveys, after a course of say 50 English miles circuitously southwest, the black drainings of those dreary and intricate Peatbog-and-Sand countries. [...] "LUCH," [...] it appears, signifies LOCH (or Hole, Hollow); and [...] "Rhyn-Luch" [...] will mean, to Prussian ears, the Peatbog Quagmire drained by the RHYN.--New Ruppin, where this beautiful black Stream first becomes considerable, and of steadily black complexion, lies between 40 and 50 miles northwest of Berlin. Ten or twelve miles farther north is REINSBERG (properly RHYNSBERG), where Friedrich as Crown-Prince lived his happiest few years. The details of which were familiar to us long ago,--and no doubt dwell clear and soft, in their appropriate [...] "pale moonlight," [...] in Friedrich's memory on this occasion. Some time after his Accession, he gave the place to Prince Henri, who lived there till 1802. It is now fallen all dim; {{and there is nothing}} at New Ruppin but a remembrance.|$|E
40|$|Vultures {{comprise}} two geographically {{isolated and}} taxonomically distinct groups, Old World accipitrids and New World vulturids, {{and provide a}} classic case of convergent evolution. In both regions, several species of vultures often feed together in large numbers on carcasses. Behavioral studies of East African and Amazonian vultures have documented parallels in apparent ecological separation within this guild of specialized scavengers. Here morphological differences in skull, beak, and manibular dimensions are compared among sympatric vultures in East Africa, South Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Amazonia, and the Pleistocene Rancho La Brea deposits in California. A discriminant function analysis based on morphological indices separates three basic feeding types: rippers, <b>gulpers,</b> and scrappers. Vultures of the three feeding types are present in both Pleistocene and Recent assemblages and show a similar distribution of body sizes into three size classes, suggesting that competition has favored similar pathways of ecological separation. This is true even when phylogenetic differences among some of the assemblages are partially accounted for. Comparisons between the fossil and extant New World vultures indicate that more specialized species were prone to extinction and {{that there has been a}} reduction in body size since the Pleistocene...|$|R
500|$|Each {{criterion}} has exceptions. Tuna, swordfish, {{and some}} species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptations—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature. Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna, salmon, and jacks that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to {{species such as}} eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second. Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air {{as well as from}} the water using a variety of different structures. Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as Corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach. Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and <b>gulpers.</b> Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in moray eels), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid (various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs), cycloid, and ctenoid (these last two are found on most bony fish). There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water. Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows. A single, an undescribed species of Phreatobius, has been called a true [...] "land fish" [...] as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged leaf litter. Many species live in underground lakes, underground rivers or aquifers and are popularly known as cavefish.|$|R
50|$|Human {{interaction}} with the <b>gulper</b> shark exists mainly {{in the form of}} fishing. Longline fishing is a typical method for fishing at the depth required to catch <b>gulper</b> sharks, and the broad distribution of <b>gulper</b> habitat leads to this method being used to catch gulpers around the world. However, <b>gulper</b> sharks are not always caught intentionally. The deep waters in which the <b>gulper</b> and similar shark species live is difficult to harvest, and longlines are an unspecific form of fishing. Longlines intended for other species can easily catch <b>gulper</b> sharks.|$|E
50|$|Other {{areas of}} <b>gulper</b> shark populations have no current regulations. The Northwest Atlantic Ocean {{currently}} has no rules {{in regard to}} the harvesting of <b>gulper</b> sharks, and has already seen a decrease in <b>gulper</b> population of 80-95% since 1990.|$|E
50|$|Saccopharynx ampullaceus, {{referred}} to as the <b>gulper</b> eel, <b>gulper,</b> taillight <b>gulper</b> or pelican-fish, is an ocean dwelling, eel-like fish found in the North Atlantic Ocean. They are found up to a depth of 3000 m. Little information is currently known about their habits or full distribution.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{frequency}} and patterns of migration the <b>gulper</b> shark population estimates may be inaccurate with some sharks being counted twice, which are exacerbated by inappropriate tagging techniques. There are multiple species of <b>gulper</b> sharks, which has contributed to misidentification in the past. For example, populations of the <b>gulper</b> shark in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean may represent a separate species. Therefore, taxonomic confusion may influence current geographical range. The <b>gulper</b> sharks like deep, murky waters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gulper</b> shark is a {{deepwater}} oceanic species, {{living in}} waters ranging between 100 and 1490 meters in depth, with the juveniles being the main occupant {{of the lower}} half of the depths. [...] Acceptable habitats for <b>gulper</b> populations are found globally, wherever temperate and tropical waters are found. The <b>gulper</b> shark is most commonly found in the 300 to 800 meter depth range, inhabiting the upper continental slopes and outer continental shelves, the <b>gulper</b> is highly migratory species and has schooling habits based on multiple sharks being present around baited cameras.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>gulper</b> sharks tend to outnumber females 2:1, {{which is}} common for many fish species. The life {{expectancy}}, longevity, of female <b>gulper</b> sharks ranges between 54 and 70 years. Having a long life expectancy but a low net reproduction rate suggests that the population of <b>gulper</b> sharks would be {{at a very high}} risk if too many of them were killed from excessive fishing.|$|E
50|$|While {{information}} concerning <b>gulper</b> sharks exists, {{there is no}} place to centrally compile the information so that other researchers may easily obtain it. This leads to repetition in basic data and less depth into the subject matter. Information presented may also be inaccurate as many genus of Centrophorus are morphologically similar. While attempts are being made {{to make it easier to}} identify different genus, such as Daley’s use of 16s mitochondrial DNA listed above, older data listed for <b>gulper</b> sharks could be for ones other than the granulosus, such as the dumb <b>gulper</b> shark. This also means that current populations numbers could account for other dogfish than just the <b>gulper</b> sharks. Lastly, due to the frequency and patterns of migration, the recorded <b>gulper</b> shark populations may be inaccurate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gulper</b> life {{strategy}} is {{also consistent with}} their trophic level and place in the deepwater community. They are tertiary consumers with no apparent predators, so their biological gear toward competition is an ecologically sound strategy. The introduction of human interaction with <b>gulper</b> sharks is the introduction of a higher trophic level, and presents a relationship that current <b>gulper</b> biology is not equipped to handle while maintaining steady or growing population size.|$|E
5000|$|The western <b>gulper</b> shark (Centrophorus westraliensis) is {{a species}} of squaliform shark {{discovered}} in 2008. The species had previously {{been identified as a}} variant of the dumb <b>gulper</b> shark, however was differentiated based on morphology. The western <b>gulper</b> is known from the waters of Western Australia, as well as Indonesia and islands in the Southern Indian Ocean. This shark is classified as [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{overexploitation}} in <b>gulper</b> sharks is {{that they}} require nearly {{as much time as}} humans to mature and reproduce. Their life strategy indicates that the frame of view for <b>gulper</b> fishing plans needs to be based on longer amounts of time, to allow for the consideration of the next generation of individuals. <b>Gulper</b> shark do not mature much faster than humans, so they need to be exploited based on a schedule that reflects this. However, being harvested by a species with similar growth patterns means that the <b>gulper</b> shark is unlikely to be considered in this way. It is highly susceptible to overexploitation leading to widespread population decline and its status and a species vulnerable to endangerment.|$|E
50|$|While {{the fishing}} of <b>gulper</b> sharks and {{utilization}} of squalene from their livers is not inherently {{an activity that}} drives them toward extinction, overexploitation of the species can be a problem. The status of <b>gulper</b> sharks on the ICUN red list is currently only vulnerable rather than endangered. The squalene taken from the <b>gulper</b> liver is in high demand as a possible cancer therapy component among other uses, leading to unchecked harvesting of the species. When the populations are declining due to overexploitation, each viable individual is important. As much as 80% of the <b>gulper</b> population has been depleted in some areas, so any harvesting can have a large effect on {{the decline of the}} species or possible recovery.|$|E
50|$|Female <b>gulper</b> sharks {{typically}} have between 2 and 10 pups in their lifetime, with generally one pup per pregnancy, this {{is considered to}} be a low fecundity. Once fertilized, females can hold up to 6 mature egg cells, or oocytes, in their body at a time. The length of time these egg cells are kept inside the female’s body is called the gestation period. <b>Gulper</b> sharks have a long gestation period, around two years. <b>Gulper</b> sharks can have long resting periods between pregnancies.|$|E
