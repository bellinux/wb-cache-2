Used as giant stink bombs to trick the enemy, [...] "stinks" [...] were malodorous but harmless substances such as bone oil and amyl acetate used to simulate a poison gas attack, thereby compelling the enemy to put on their cumbersome masks (which reduced the efficiency of German troops) on occasions when gas could not be safely employed. Alternatively, [...] "stinks" [...] could be used to artificially prolong the scale, discomfort and duration of genuine gas-attacks i.e. alternating projectiles containing [...] "stinks" [...] with phosgene, adamsite or chloropicrin.

40|$|Multiple explosions {{occurred}} when five workers were {{acting on a}} footbridge structure {{at the top of}} crude olive pomace oil tanks. Welding on the tank roofs was performed without previously cleaning the tanks stopping heir operation. First, one of the several ∼ 650 -m 3 reservoirs exploded, provoking a pool fire that spread throughout the tank farm. Roughly 1 h later, two other reservoirs exploded causing the launching of missiles to a distance of 60 - 80 m and a huge fire that extended throughout the entire tank farm. Four workers were killed instantaneously. The explosion was caused by the unusually high content of hexane in the crude olive pomace oil and, hence, by the inefficiency of the desolventization process which creates a flammable and <b>explosive</b> <b>oil</b> from a combustible on...|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} disposal {{technology for}} waste energetic materials which has demonstrated potential for future applications at military installations is the reuse {{of these materials}} as a supplemental fuel for industrial combustors. The Department of Defense, over time, has accumulated a significant stockpile of waste energetic materials which requires disposal. The current disposal options, incineration, open burning and open detonation, are either cost prohibitive or under environmental scrutiny. alternative disposal technology which shows promise is the reutilization of these energetic materia 1;s as a supplemental fuel. Initial {{studies have indicated that}} it is feasible and economical to utilize the energy content from explosives and propellants to supplement fuel oil in industrial boilers. Significant progress has been made on the development on the process to use explosives as a supplemental fuel. Previous pilot scale tests and initial tests from a pilot scale demonstration at Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant, Hawthorne, Nevada, have clearly demonstrated that <b>explosives</b> fuel <b>oil</b> mixtures can be safely fired into a standard industrial boiler. A state-of-the-art pilot scale system was designed and constructed for solvating and mixing <b>explosives</b> with fuel <b>oil</b> and firing the resultant mixture into a into a boiler to generate steam.
