30|$|Organized by the prefecture, the PI is {{hosted by}} the town hall and falls under the {{responsibility}} of an <b>investigating</b> <b>commissioner</b> (IC) mandated by the administrative court. 4 Their duration is typically 1 – 2  months. During that time span, {{members of the public}} may visit the town hall to consult documents and give their opinion in a register. They may also send their opinion by mail or e-mail. The ICs {{play an important role in}} public information during the PI. They are requested to hold four reception sessions during which they facilitate access to the project’s files by explaining and discussing them with citizens. When the participatory phase of the PI is over, the ICs gather, sort and summarize the comments, opinions, and proposals from citizens and send a report to the project promoter. In the last stage, they take into account answers provided by the promoter to write a subjective, argued opinion on the project, which can be positive, positive with reservations or negative. For this study, we focused on PIs organized in 2015 and 2016 as part of exploration works requests related to six projects located in or close to the EMS. We collected the 426 opinions submitted by French citizens 5 as well as the documents presented by the operators and investigating commissioners. We also observed town hall meetings during which citizens confronted the investigating commissioners as well as several other public meetings and debates related to the PIs.|$|E

5000|$|Sporting an all-purple costume, this Wrath, who Batman is {{convinced}} is a copycat {{from his first}} appearance, begins murdering police officers visiting Gotham for a convention and breaks into Grayle Hudson's apartment. After a fight with Batman, during which he confirms he's not the original Wrath- and is apparently unaware of Batman's true identity- he tells the Dark Knight to <b>investigate</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Gordon's actions on June 26 twenty five years ago— the same night Bruce Wayne's parents died. [...] Upon another meeting with Batman, the second Wrath tells a distorted version {{of the events that}} happened (Although it is unclear if he is reciting the version he learned from the original Wrath or if he has twisted it in his own mind), saying Gordon killed the original Wrath's parents in cold blood, though Batman saw through this and realized that Gordon shot them in self-defense. His subsequent assessment of the old Wrath helps Batman determine the identity of the new one; as the original Wrath sought to duplicate all of Batman's methods, Batman concludes that the new Wrath must be the original's equivalent of Robin.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{pressure}} from the business community, the city council unanimously announced {{in the spring of}} 1976 that it would <b>investigate</b> <b>Commissioner</b> D'Artois regarding a series of corruption cases in the public safety department. When public opinion swung against the council members for [...] "investigating themselves", Mayor Allen called for the probe to {{be turned over to the}} office of Attorney General William J. Guste. Allen and D'Artois were previously allies on the council, but Hathaway had often opposed them both. When Allen called for D'Artois to step down from office voluntarily while the state probe proceeded, Hathaway said that he thought that it made little difference whether D'Artois remained in office while the investigation was underway because he believed that Guste's staff would conduct a thorough, fair investigation. Guste's investigators soon indicated the probe would go beyond the public safety department, with at Mayor Allen and Utilities Commissioner Collins as well. D'Artois did not step down voluntarily but was forced to resign on August 6, 1976, when he was arrested for conspiracy to murder his former advertising specialist, Jim Leslie of Shreveport. He died of complications of heart surgery ten months later in June 1977 in San Antonio, Texas. Many unanswered questions remained, such as what role if any D'Artois had in the assassination of Jim Leslie.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFour public {{inquiries}} on deep geothermal {{projects in}} the Eurometropolis of Strasbourg were conducted during the Spring of 2015. These consultation exercises were carried out {{in a context of}} public controversy over the risk related to deep drilling. Residents’ associations have been deeply involved and the media largely covered the issue. Following these consultations, three of the four projects received a negative opinion from the <b>investigating</b> <b>commissioners.</b> Later, prefectural authority granted two of the four projects. How to interpret this opposition to urban geothermal projects? And what can we say about the way residents, stakeholders and public authorities engage with the public inquiries? To answer such questions we have decided to work on three distinct corpuses: (1) The public inquiries per se, taking into account the input from citizens during the enquiry and all the documents produced in the framework of these consultation exercises; (2) Local media, these public inquiries having been widely reported in the media. It is therefore crucial to examine the way journalists feature stakeholders and geothermal issues; (3) A series of interviews we have carried out with different stakeholders (scientists, industrialists, associations representatives, elected officials, inquiry commissioners, etc.). We will analyse these three corpuses according to two main guidelines. First, we will focus on the public inquiry system. Indeed, {{it is important to understand}} how it works and how the publics, the stakeholders and the investigator commissioners tackle it. At a more global level, it is important to analyse what public inquiries have led to. Has a social dialogue been established? Or, have the public inquiries led to the strengthening of demarcation lines between opponents and supporters of geothermal projects? In the background, of course, it is the public perception of the public inquiry system that becomes apparent. The second line of enquiry concerns the public perception of deep geothermal projects and the dynamics of the public controversy. For example, how are the different issues related to geothermal projects perceived by the different stakeholders? Are geothermal projects perceived to serve populations and/or the state energy policy? How are the economic, political and social dimensions of these projects perceived? It is also important to understand the purpose for which citizens engage in the debate on geothermal projects: is it to preserve their close environment and their quality of life? Or is this engagement related to philosophical or political convictions? In this context, it is crucial to understand how the citizens get informed about the geothermal issues and the public inquiries. And more particularly, what roles do the media and the residents’ associations (among others) play in this public controversy...|$|R
40|$|Dans cet article, l'auteur analyse les jugements du Tribunal du travail du Québec en matière de congédiement pour activité syndicale. In this article, {{the author}} {{attempts}} a study {{not only of}} legislative texts dealing with dismissal for union activities in Québec labour legislation since 1960, {{but also of the}} jurisprudence related to the numerous decisions handed down on the subject by the Québec Labour Relations Commission, and also by the <b>Investigating</b> <b>Commissioners</b> and the Labour Court. Provisions respecting dismissal for union activities were first included in the Labour Relations Act at the end of 1959. Basically, these provisions provided for the rehiring of workers dismissed for union activities, and obliged employers to prove that the worker had been dismissed for some other just and sufficient reason and not for union activities or for the exercice of a legal right. These provisions, with few changes, were included in the Labour Code published September 1, 1964. Since the introduction of these sections into the labour laws, thousands of decisions have been handed down ; decisions which have created many problems and given rise to quite varying interpretations. The author has tried {{to come to grips with}} the underlying reasons for these interpretations and, as far as the « other just and sufficient reason » is concerned, he mentions two schools of thought on the subject. One school holds that the person called upon to hand down a decision should not substitute his judgment for that of the employer, and the second school holds that, on the contrary, this person should carefully assess the nature of the « other just and sufficient reason ». According to the author, the problem is not easily resolved. It is obvious, however, that prevailing ideas in society concerning unions and the behavior of their leaders, does have a certain influence on decisions which are handed down. As for the reasons given by employers for dismissing workers, the author treats those where employers cite : economic and technological causes, the influence of the employee's service record on decisions, ignorance of the employee's union activities, the weight of circumstance related to the dismissal (which causes the author to wonder if, in order to establish presumption, one has only to consider the union activities of the employee or also the propaganda and recruiting going on in the industry at the time of dismissal), delays incurred between the moment the offense was committed and the dismissal, and lack of work and other economic reasons for not recalling a worker who has been laid off...|$|R

In 1871, Savage traveled to Egypt to act with the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone, a former American general in the Egyptian Army, serving under Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army, Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three <b>commissioners</b> <b>investigating</b> a series of border incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872–74.

It was the only time in Australian history that two Royal Commissions have been held on the same incident, although it was emphasised that the second enquiry was to focus on Cabban's allegations, not the accident itself.
