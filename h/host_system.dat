5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the <b>host</b> <b>system,</b> this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|Intel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) {{used the}} term write {{amplification}} in their papers and publications as early as 2008. Write amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the <b>host</b> <b>system.</b> Without compression, write amplification cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write amplification of 0.5, with best-case values as low as 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller.|$|E

25|$|Most flash drives ship {{preformatted}} {{with the}} FAT32, or exFAT file systems. The ubiquity of the FAT32 file system allows {{the drive to}} be accessed on virtually any host device with USB support. Also, standard FAT maintenance utilities (e.g., ScanDisk) {{can be used to}} repair or retrieve corrupted data. However, because a flash drive appears as a USB-connected hard drive to the <b>host</b> <b>system,</b> the drive can be reformatted to any file system supported by the host operating system.|$|E
25|$|The 68EC000 {{was used}} as a {{controller}} in many audio applications, including Ensoniq musical instruments and sound cards, where {{it was part of the}} MIDI synthesizer. On Ensoniq sound boards, the controller provided several advantages compared to competitors without a CPU on board. The processor allowed the board to be configured to perform various audio tasks, such as MPU-401 MIDI synthesis or MT-32 emulation, without the use of a TSR program. This improved software compatibility, lowered CPU usage, and eliminated <b>host</b> <b>system</b> memory usage.|$|E

In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulation in order to decide the optimal repair capacity when both failures and repair times of individual <b>host</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit long range dependent (LRD) property.

25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the <b>host</b> <b>system)</b> of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via read-only memory (ROM, EPROM, etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E
25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the <b>host</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Download Play {{allows users}} to play local {{multiplayer}} games with other Nintendo 3DS systems using only one Game Card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65 feet) of {{each other for the}} guest system to download the necessary data from the <b>host</b> <b>system.</b> Download Play on Nintendo 3DS systems is also backward compatible, meaning that it is also available for Nintendo DS games. Unlike Download Play on Nintendo DS, game data, once downloaded to the guest system, is stored on the system's SD card, no longer requiring a re-download for a future game session. Nintendo 3DS games can only transfer a maximum of 32MB of data to other systems while in download play. Other forms of local multiplayer modes require each player to own the software that is currently being used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Virtualization enables {{installation}} and running of multiple virtual machines {{on the same}} computer system. Operating system that communicates directly with hardware {{is known as the}} <b>host</b> operating <b>system</b> whereas virtual operating systems have all the features of a real operating system, but they run inside the <b>host</b> operating <b>system.</b> A virtual machine is separated from the computer hardware resources and it runs on the emulated hardware. Performance of the virtual operating system running on the same computer system hardware depends on the performance of the <b>host</b> operating <b>system.</b> In this paper we study how different <b>host</b> operating <b>systems</b> influence virtual machine performance. Windows XP®, Windows Vista ™ and Windows 7 ™ are used as <b>host</b> operating <b>systems</b> using Windows Vista as a virtual operating system. Performance measurement of the virtual operating system is done in the same controlled conditions for all three <b>host</b> operating <b>systems</b> using benchmark applications.

500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of flash memory's operation, data cannot be {{directly}} overwritten as it can in a hard disk drive. When data is first written to an SSD, the cells all start in an erased state so data can be written directly using pages at a time ( [...] in size). The SSD controller on the SSD, which manages the flash memory and interfaces with the <b>host</b> <b>system,</b> uses a logical-to-physical mapping system known as logical block addressing (LBA) and {{that is part of the}} flash translation layer (FTL). When new data comes in replacing older data already written, the SSD controller will write the new data in a new location and update the logical mapping to point to the new physical location. The data in the old location is no longer valid, and will need to be erased before the location can be written again.|$|E

Rootkits achieve this by modifying the behavior of core parts of an operating system through loading code into other processes, the installation or modification of drivers, or kernel modules. Obfuscation techniques include concealing running processes from system-monitoring mechanisms and hiding system files and other configuration data.
