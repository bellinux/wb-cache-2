5|$|Daniels' {{decision}} {{to run for}} Governor of Indiana led {{to most of the}} rest of Republican field of candidates to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. The only challenger who did not do so was conservative activist and lobbyist Eric Miller. Miller worked for the Phoenix Group, a Christian rights defense group. Daniels' campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies. He won the primary with 67% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In October {{with the}} World Series {{approaching}} and Tancredo's team the Colorado Rockies representing the National League, {{he decided to}} offer a bet with fellow candidate Mitt Romney whose team the Boston Red Sox were representing the American League.

Luckily for Tancredo, the Romney campaign turned down the bet and Boston won the world series.|$|E

5|$|Orozco, who {{saw himself}} as being {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he tried {{to run for governor}} of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. When, {{in the aftermath of the}} Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E
5|$|Federer's {{first and}} only title of 2013 came at the Gerry Weber Open (def. Mikhail Youzhny), where he also played doubles with good friend Tommy Haas. With the victory in Halle, he tied John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era. Federer, however, was unable to {{maintain}} his form into Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam tournament defeat since 2003 {{in the second round}} against Sergiy Stakhovsky. Not only did the loss end Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive quarterfinals at Grand Slam tournaments, it meant he would <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top 4 for first time since July 2003, exactly 10 years after he won his first Wimbledon title.|$|E
5|$|He scored 22 {{goals in}} his 23 England {{appearances}} over a ten-year international career from 1938 to 1948, including four against Portugal in May 1947. He helped England to win two British Home Championship titles outright (1946–47 and 1947–48), {{and to share}} the Championship in 1938–39. He fell out of international contention {{at the age of}} 28 due to his contempt for manager Walter Winterbottom, his decision to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Division, and the emergence of Jackie Milburn and Nat Lofthouse. As well as his England caps, he also represented The Football League XI and played in a special Great Britain game against Europe in 1947. He married twice, and had two children and one step-child. His ashes are held in the National Football Museum, and he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation {{to take his}} place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson {{to remain as}} a candidate. Johnson replied {{that it was not}} {{in the best interest of}} the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{unsuccessful}} bids {{came from}} Seattle Public Schools, who had proposed renovating the building into {{an elementary school}} in 2014, the first downtown school in 65 years. Initially, the district applied to the GSA in July 2014 through the United States Department of Education to acquire the property, but were rejected by the latter over the tentative nature of the application; the school board later voted in November 2014 against submitting a second application over the $50 million cost and 3-year deadline for renovations. The district was, however, allowed {{to participate in the}} January 2015 auction and submitted an opening bid of $1 million; Seattle Public Schools was the first bidder to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auction when the price passed the district's final bid of $5.8 million.|$|E

5|$|Striker Calvin Andrew, who {{had been}} {{released}} by Mansfield in January 2014, was signed on a contract {{for the remainder of}} the season. He made his debut as a substitute in York's 1–0 home win over bottom of the table Torquay, in which Hayhurst scored the only goal in the 11th minute with an 18-yard shot that deflected off Aaron Downes. Middlesbrough winger Brobbel rejoined on loan until the end of the season, following an injury to Carson. York's run of successive wins ended on six matches after a 0–0 home draw with Burton, and this result saw York <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play-offs in eighth-place. With the team recording six wins and one draw in March 2014, including six clean sheets, Worthington was named League Two Manager of the Month.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State. In response to the poor start, Fulmer overhauled his defense and coped with the loss of his first- and second-string quarterbacks by bringing in acclaimed freshman Peyton Manning, son of National Football League star Archie Manning.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E

5|$|When Bevin {{told the}} media {{he would have}} an {{announcement}} at his campaign headquarters on April 28, speculation raged that he would <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. Instead, Bevin {{announced that he would}} release his jobs plan later in the week and chided the local media for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that burdensome regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million. He also proposed a flat income tax and opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Although Bart {{initially}} {{intends to}} <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group {{as soon as}} possible, he decides to attend a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to enjoy {{being a member of}} the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using is out of refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, the raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E
