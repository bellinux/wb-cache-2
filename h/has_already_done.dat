25|$|Vale also faced {{opposition}} from the China Shipowners' Association which claimed that the Brazilian mining company is seeking to control the freight market as it <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> with the iron ore prices. In the past, the Chinese ports {{were not allowed to}} increase their capacity to more than 300,000 tons for dry bulk carriers due to safety and environmental concerns. If the 400,000-ton Valemax vessels are allowed to Chinese ports, Vale's monopoly on the route may result in losses for other shipping companies operating capesize ore carriers. When Vale Brasil was diverted to Italy on her maiden voyage, there was speculation that the domestic steel industry of China had urged the authorities to protect their commercial interests. However, Vale has also received support from the Chinese steel companies as they would benefit from lower transportation costs.|$|E
500|$|Homer quickly gains {{favor with}} Fat Tony, {{due to a}} {{confrontation}} engineered by the FBI agent, and Fat Tony breaks him and the entire group out of prison and offers {{him a chance to}} join the syndicate. Homer's first task is to burn down Moe's Tavern in revenge for Moe's rudeness toward Fat Tony on the phone, but Homer finds that Moe <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> the deed himself. Fat Tony accepts Homer into the syndicate and the two develop a special bond; however, complications over a scheme to import weapons put the syndicate under severe stress. Eventually Fat Tony discovers Homer's undercover status and, emotionally devastated by his betrayal, suffers a fatal heart attack.|$|E

500|$|Terri Schwartz of IGN {{scored the}} premiere 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, and praising {{the introduction of}} Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix". Schwartz was positive about the smaller cast compared to the previous season, which meant that the episode [...] "doesn't feel as overstuffed as it would have", and of Coulson not finding Johnson and asking her to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. straight away after the newly established status quo. Schwartz did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material, particularly criticizing the [...] "sexy" [...] opening of the episode with Johnson because [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> a great job establishing Daisy as a sexy character without needing to depict it in this unsubtle way. Hopefully the inclusion of more overt sexuality in the show feels a bit more organic to the show as it continues".|$|E
500|$|The year 2004 saw {{the release}} of four films {{featuring}} Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, [...] "Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done,</b> but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour." [...] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors {{in front of a}} bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent. Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, if {{the user}} <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> {{business}} with a company, or is previously familiar with a product, they {{have a tendency to}} not read the privacy policies that the company has posted. As internet companies become more established, their policies may change, but their clients will be less likely to inform themselves of the change. This tendency is interesting because as consumers become more acquainted with the internet they {{are also more likely to}} be interested in online privacy. [...] Finally, consumers have been found to avoid reading the privacy policies if the policies are not in a simple format, and even perceive these policies to be irrelevant. [...] The less readily available terms and conditions are, the less likely the public is to inform themselves of their rights regarding the service they are using.|$|E
2500|$|However, Verdi had {{not lost}} sight of Corsaro at all, as is {{demonstrated}} in a letter he wrote to Piave. [...] Impatient because of the delays, Piave had asked for his libretto {{to be returned to}} him in order that he might fulfill another commitment. Verdi was shocked: [...] "Give you back Il corsaro, that Corsaro which has always fascinated me and which I've thought about so much, and which you've put into verse with more than your usual care?" [...] The composer continues to explain details of the work on the music he <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done,</b> but notes [...] "I still have to write the opera for Lucca." [...] Piave relented, and he moved ahead on Macbeth 's libretto. But, {{by the end of the}} year, when Lucca and the British impresario, Benjamin Lumley were raising the issue of the London contract, Verdi replied that he found Il corsaro [...] "dull (freddo) and theatrically ineffective".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Fallout", Claire's father reveals {{that he knew}} about her powers long before {{she was aware of}} them. He {{acknowledges}} doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him. [...] In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him [...] "tick." [...] Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. [...] When Claire finds out {{that the two of them}} have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. [...] It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E

2500|$|Mursal ( [...] meaning [...] "hurried"): if {{the narrator}} between the Successor and Muhammad is omitted from a given isnād, the hadith is mursal, e.g., when a Successor says, “The Prophet said ...” Since Sunnis {{believe in the}} uprightness of all Sahaba, they do not {{view it as a}} {{necessary}} problem if a Successor does not mention what Sahaba he received the hadith from. This means that if a hadith has an acceptable chain all the way to a Successor, and the successor attributes it to an unspecified companion, the isnād is considered acceptable. There are, however, different views in some cases: If the Successor is a young one and it is probable that he omitted an elder Successor who in turn reported from a companion. The opinion held by Imam Malik and all Maliki jurists is that the mursal of a trustworthy person is valid, just like a musnad hadith. This view has been developed to such an extreme that to some of them, the mursal is even better than the musnad, based on the following reasoning: [...] "The one who reports a musnad hadith leaves you with the names of the reporters for further investigation and scrutiny, whereas the one who narrates by way of irsal (the absence of the link between the successor and the Prophet), being a knowledgeable and trustworthy person himself, <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done</b> so and found the hadith to be sound. In fact, he saves you from further research." [...] Others reject the mursal of a younger Successor.|$|E
2500|$|Uriel is a {{character}} in The Dresden Files book series by Jim Butcher. In Small Favor, Uriel is a subtle but powerful player in the war with the Black Council and the Fallen/Denarians. Called the [...] "Watchman", he only reveals himself to the book's protagonist, Harry Dresden, as a janitor named [...] "Jake". In the novel, Harry receives the power of soulfire and believes that it came from Uriel. He is {{also referred to as}} Heaven's [...] "spook". [...] Uriel also appears at the end of Jim Butcher's novella The Warrior, which was released {{as a part of the}} anthology, Mean Streets. Uriel appears again in Changes, when Harry Dresden asks him for help, after being paralyzed from the waist down. Uriel tells him that he cannot help him, and that he is limited to what he <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>done.</b> He also tells Harry that Maggie is indeed his daughter, something that he hadn't been entirely sure of. In Ghost Story, Uriel uses his influence to offer Harry the opportunity to come back to Earth as a spirit to find out the identity of his killer. [...] This is not revealed until close to the end of the book, when Uriel also shows Harry that his friends and family will be okay in his absence. [...] He also shows how Harry was unduly influenced to take up the mantle of the Winter Knight and redresses this imbalance by telling him that Mab, the Winter Queen cannot change who he is. At another point in the book, Uriel becomes enraged when Harry nicknames him [...] "Uri" [...] (omitting [...] "el" [...] (God) from the phrase making up Uriel's name). Unlike his appearances in Small Favor and The Warrior, Uriel's form in Changes and Ghost Story is that of a young man with blond hair, rather than an old janitor. During his appearance in Skin Game, his form is that of an olive skinned young man with dark hair. He is not bound by linear time, and is responsible for protecting Free Will. [...] The author has described the character as a VP of Creation.|$|E
