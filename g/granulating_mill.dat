5000|$|A fatal {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} Ballincollig Powder Mills on 25 June 1841, when two men were killed by {{an explosion in the}} corning house. Little is known about this incident, but two years later another {{fatal accident}} took place. Shortly after reporting for work on Saturday, 29 July 1843, John Carol and Jeremiah Long donned their working clothes and special shoes and went to their place of work at the <b>granulating</b> (corning <b>mill).</b> In the building at the time were 21 barrels, each containing 100 lb of gunpowder. One of the men put the machinery in motion and two minutes later a massive explosion rocked Ballincollig. ‘Slates, timber, lead and stones were thrown to a great distance, not a stone in the mill was left standing; even its foundations were torn up and scattered and {{the only part of the}} machinery standing is a large metal wheel used in the process of granulating. Carrol and Long were killed instantly, their bodies were cast a considerable distance, and in quite different directions. They were wholly denuded of clothes and presented a shocking appearance - mutilated and scarcely recognizable.’ ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{process of}} dry granulation using roller-compaction (DG/RC) is effectively a non-batch based procedure orientated {{to deliver a}} continuous stream of material free of a pre-defined batch-size with reduced plant equipment/scale-up R&D resources and an enhanced work-throughput, particularly suitable for moisture sensitive formulation. The desirable accreditations of DG/RC are many; yet {{by the nature of}} a more flexible approach than (i. e. wet-granulation), it must be highly monitored and controlled to accomplish higher-throughput rates and reduced ‘static’ material testing stages. To monitor rapidly and in-line with production, pre-granulated ribbons of RC (which highly correlates to the post <b>milled</b> <b>granulates),</b> terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) is used to elucidate the key physical attributes of post-compression density and thickness uniformity, key to end-product consistency. Invariably a great number of conditions apply to DG/RC (viz: System design, material characteristics, environmental and unit configuration), although widely regarded as the key processing parameters (PP’s) are roll-pressure and roll-gap [1 - 4]. The target of the study is to derive a strategy to position TDS as PAT to DG/RC. Two terahertz time-domain TD methods of a conventional transmission setup and reflection (TPI) THz analysis are used on standards of glass slides for verifying the interpretational foundations of the TD methods.

40|$|One “Quality by Design” {{approach}} is {{the focus on the}} variability of the properties of the active substance. This is crucially important for active substances that are obtained from natural resources such as herbal plant material and extracts. In this paper, we present various strategies for the development of herbal products especially taking into account the natural batch-to-batch variability (mainly of the dry mass) of tablets that contain a fixed amount of tincture. The following steps in the development have been evaluated for the outcome of the physico-chemical properties of the resulting tablets and intermediates: concentration of the tincture extracted from Echinacea fresh plant, loading of the concentrate onto an inert carrier, the respective wet granulation and drying step, including milling, and the adjuvant excipients for the tablet compression step. The responses that were investigated are the mean particle size of the dried and <b>milled</b> <b>granulates,</b> compaction properties and disintegration time of the tablets. Increased particle size showed a significant increase of the disintegration time and a decrease of the compaction properties. In addition, our results showed that the particle size has a great dependency on the ratio of liquid to carrier during the wet granulation process. Thus, the variability of the respective parameters tested was influenced by the performed strategies, which is how the tincture correlated to its dry mass and the relation of the amount of carrier used. In order to optimize these parameters, a strategy considering the above-mentioned points has to be chosen...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{manufacturing}} {{has traditionally}} been considered largely a matter of regulatory compliance. Consequently, it has been inefficient, but it is now increasingly being recognized {{as an opportunity for}} cost reduction. Recent initiatives by regulatory authorities, and by the industry, aim at easing regulations and encouraging process innovation. Even though significant improvements, especially in process control and minimization of process interruptions, have been achieved, the underlying process technology has not changed for decades. For example, typical process steps to produce the most common pharmaceutical products, immediate-release solid dosage forms, from drug substance and excipient are: blending, wet <b>granulating,</b> drying, <b>milling</b> and screening, blending, tableting, coating, and so on. A new process, such as blending combined with solvent-less, multi-component injection-molding could greatly simplify manufacturing. Injection-molding, however, yields a non-porous material, intrinsically different from the state-of-the-art powder-compacted, porous dosage forms. This may appear problematic, because current products rely on a large surface area-to-volume ratio to achieve immediate drug release. In addition, process rates previously achieved by injection-molding solid dosage forms have been comparably low [...] offsetting some of the benefits offered by that process. In this thesis, an analytical approach is first developed to model drug release from non-porous dosage forms, comprising a fast eroding excipient and randomly distributed drug particles in it. The model considers the central role of microstructure in drug release. Particular importance is given to the role of clusters of connected, slowly eroding drug particles, and to the effect of drug particle protrusion, due to their slow erosion rate, from the eroding excipient surface. The model is validated by dissolution experiments. Good agreement is observed between the model and the experimental data. The drug release model is then used in product design for manufacturing as an optimization problem [...] with manufacturing performance as objective function and design specifications as constraints. It is found that the drug volume fraction needs to be about 0. 5 to efficiently produce non-porous dosage forms in specification, which implies that an excessive amount of excipient material is required. Therefore, new product designs are proposed: a cellular excipient micro-structure with up to ten-fold reduction in excipient content. The new designs are further shown to allow injection-molding of immediate-release dosage forms that meet specifications with a three-fold increase in injection-molding process rate compared with conventional designs. by Aron H.
