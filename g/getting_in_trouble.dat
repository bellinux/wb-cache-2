5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

25|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{played a}} key role in the history of Indian theatre, music and dance, {{particularly}} through the tradition of Ras and Leela. These are dramatic enactments about Krishna's childhood, teenage and adult life. The themes range from his innocent frolics as a child, to his expressing his confusion and doubts about approaching girls, to him wooing and romancing gopis (girls in the cow herding community) who meet him secretly thus <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with their parents, to his intimacy with beloved Radha, to his playing flute while saving the world from all sorts of troubles and thus preserving the dharma. Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda. While Indian dance and music theatre traces its origins to the ancient Sama Veda and Natyasastra texts, the Bhagavata Purana and other Krishna-related texts such as Harivamsa and Vishnu have inspired numerous choreographic themes.|$|E

500|$|... "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie" [...] is {{the sixth}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on November 3, 1992. The plot follows Bart continually <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and how Homer is unable to give him any suitable punishment. Marge gets Homer to agree to make a punishment stick, and he forbids Bart {{to see the new}} Itchy & Scratchy movie, a punishment that Homer takes very seriously. It was written by John Swartzwelder and was directed by Rich Moore.|$|E
500|$|Producer Barry Rosen said, [...] "We {{were very}} lucky that [...] were so human-grounded, {{so we could}} really play off of them {{and the way they}} looked at things that [...] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|Peter Lawrence {{described}} Jonny as a [...] "hero in training" [...] on {{the cusp}} of adulthood. He remarked that Jonny possessed [...] "a straight-ahead, right-on attitude" [...] free of introspection or self-doubt. At age 14, Jonny was a confident problem-solver prone to <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual, and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's daring lifestyle. Jonny inherited his father's driving curiosity (rendering him a [...] "walking query"), as well as his mother's [...] "restless, adventurous spirit". Takashi designed Jonny to be lean, wiry, athletic, and coordinated. Creative directors centered episodes around Jonny; Seibert summarized the shift: ...|$|E

500|$|The Season Four DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael trying to convince Jim, Pam, and Kelly, while {{they are in the}} break room having lunch that Stanley talks badly about everyone behind their backs, Michael making Pam stand up during the meeting and confessing that she wears glasses, Jim talking to Toby about the warning (in contrast to how Toby seems happy that Jim is <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> during the broadcast episode, here the HR head makes it clear that Jim's sales performance is good and that Ryan is the sole person who is not happy with his work), and Ryan saying that [...] "going after Jim" [...] is [...] "a risky move", since CFO David Wallace likes Jim.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is being}} harassed {{by his mother}} over the phone. She calls him repeatedly, with the {{intention}} of moving in with him. The situation causes him to exhibit some stress-eating tendencies. At the same time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) begin to hang out, but Tracy gets annoyed of Josh's impression of him. He demands that Liz fire Josh, but she refuses, so instead she tries to fix the situation, but Tracy threatens to go to Jack if she does not. Josh tries to avoid <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> by calling Tracy and impersonating Jack, and then calling Jack and impersonating Tracy. It is not long before he is caught and Jack and Tracy have their revenge on him. As part of his punishment, Jack forces Josh talk to his mother [...] "Every day, {{for the rest of your}} or her life." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for {{spray-painting}} [...] "The Clash" [...] on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, {{he was arrested for}} hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in Hamburg, Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, [...] "It was a watershed—violence had really controlled me for once". He determined never again to fight violence with violence.|$|E
2500|$|In the Vedas, Indra is {{the king}} of Svarga (Heaven) and the Devas. He is the god of lightning, thunder, storms, rains and river flows. Indra is the most {{referred}} to deity in the Rigveda. He is celebrated for his powers, {{and the one who}} kills the great symbolic evil (Asura) named Vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness. Indra destroys Vritra and his [...] "deceiving forces", and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of mankind. His importance diminishes in the post-Vedic Indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with his drunken, hedonistic and adulterous ways, and the god who disturbs Hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized human beings may become more powerful than him.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Murphy became enveloped with the incident {{and wrote a}} radio documentary called Object in the Woods, featuring his experiences and interviews he had conducted that night. Shortly before the documentary would have aired, he received an unexpected visit at the station from two men in black suits identifying themselves as government officials. They requested {{to speak with him}} in a back room behind closed doors. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes. A WHJB employee, Linda Foschia, recalled the men confiscated some of Murphy's audio tapes from that night, and that no one knows what happened to the remaining photographs. A week after the visit, an agitated Murphy aired a censored version of the documentary, which he claimed in its introduction had to be edited due to some interviewees requesting their statements be removed from the broadcast in fear of <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with the police and Army. The new version contained nothing revealing, and did not mention an object at all. Mazza, and also Murphy's wife, remember the aired documentary was entirely different from what Murphy had originally written.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I propose a {{semantic}} analysis of impersonal uses of ‘you’, and related uses of other indexical expressions. The framework I employ is Kaplan’s classic analysis of indexical languages, enriched with independently motivated hypotheses about {{the identification of}} the semantically relevant context, and about the employment of generic expressions. Consider an utterance of (1) you <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with that move said by a chess instructor to a student. More often than not, such an utterance is to be understood impersonally, in the sense that, roughly, chess players typically <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> After all, (1) may well occur within a true fragment such as (1 *) according to all textbooks, you <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with that move even though textbooks obviously do not contain warnings directed to the particular student the instructor is addressing (see Nunberg 1993, 21) ...|$|R
