50|$|Very large rooms like {{concert halls}} or large {{television}} studios have fundamental resonances which are much lower in frequency than small rooms. This means the closely spaced <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> {{are likely to}} lie in the low frequency region and thus the response {{tends to be more}} uniform.|$|R
40|$|The APS {{storage ring}} beam chamber has been storing the beam up to 100 mA successfully. However, in some beam chambers, {{spurious}} signals corrupted the BPM outputs. The {{cause of the}} unwanted signals was investigated, and {{it was found that}} transverse electric (TE) longitudinal <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> of the beam chamber were responsible. The beam chambers have small height in the area between the ovid beam chamber and the antechamber. The structure behaves like a ridge waveguide so that the cut-off frequency of the waveguide mode becomes lower. The pass-band then includes the frequency around 350 MHz that is important to the beam position monitors (BPMs). The spurious <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> are damped with two types of dampers to restore the useful signals of the BPMs; coaxial loop dampers and lossy ceramic slab loading are used...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{parks are}} known as sources of {{harmonic}} distortion. The emission at the classical harmonic frequencies (low order non-triplen odd harmonics) is however low. Potential problems with connecting individual turbines and wind parks occur at non-standard frequencies, mainly due to <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances.</b> Next to the harmonic currents driven by the emission from the turbines, studies should also consider the currents driven by the harmonic background distortion.

30|$|Two {{different}} types of <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> should be distinguished: parallel resonances and series resonances [18, 23, 25]. For a parallel resonance, the impedance of the circuit is high. A moderate harmonic current from a source of harmonic distortion {{can result in a}} high harmonic voltage. A parallel resonance at the same time can result in an amplification of the harmonic current, thus the current elsewhere in the grid could be higher than that close to the source of the distortion.|$|R
40|$|We study {{inviscid}} Faraday {{waves in}} a brimful circular cylinder with pinned contact line. The pinning {{leads to a}} coupling of the Bessel modes and leads to an infinite system of coupled Mathieu equations. For large Bond numbers, even though the stability diagrams and the subharmonic and <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> for the free and pinned contact lines are similar,the free surface shapes can be quite different. With decreasing Bond number, {{not only are the}} <b>harmonic</b> and subharmonic <b>resonances</b> very different from the free contact line case but also interesting changes in the stability diagram occur with the appearance of combination resonance tongues. Points on these tongue boundaries correspond to almost periodic states. These do not seem to {{have been reported in the}} literature...|$|R

One or more tanpuras {{may be used to}} accompany vocalists or instrumentalists. It has four or five (rarely six) metal strings, which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> on the basic notes of a key.|$|E

It has come into world wide use as the so-called three-times or third <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> circuit, shown in the figure as the “advanced technology“.

A step-up transformer with a greater short-circuit inductance value is suitable for use in this case.|$|E
50|$|The tamboori (also {{called a}} tambra) is a long-necked bowed string {{instrument}} found in Indian music. The tamboori {{is very similar}} to the tanpura, despite being smaller and played with a bow. A tamboori is played as a melodic instrument, unlike the tanpura. Each string has a fundamental tone with its own spectrum of overtones, which makes a rich and vibrant sound, due to interactive <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> that will support the external tones played by the soloist.|$|E

The impact of the EMC filter, either LCL or CLC configuration, has been considered from a simplified model. The high frequency current emission, produced by a large device, can potentially cause a relatively large current flowing through a nearby small device. An important conclusion from the study is that current amplification can occur due to <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> between different types of filters. Godkänd; 2014; 20130616 (matbol...|$|R

(2011) who used data from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) multisatellite observations and low-latitude ground observations, which were performed at approximately the same longitude on the nightside.

50|$|An example, from Mason's A History of the Sciences, {{illustrates}} multi-mode vibration via a {{piece of}} string. As a natural vibrator, the string will oscillate with specific modes (the standing waves of a string in <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance),</b> dependent {{on the length of}} the string. In classical physics, a radiator of energy will act as a natural vibrator. And, since each mode will have the same energy, most of the energy in a natural vibrator will be in the smaller wavelengths and higher frequencies, where most of the modes are.|$|E
50|$|Tsunamis {{in lakes}} can be {{generated}} by fault displacement beneath or around lake systems. Faulting shifts {{the ground in a}} vertical motion through reverse, normal or oblique strike slip faulting processes, this displaces the water above causing a tsunami (Figure 1). The reason strike-slip faulting does not cause tsunamis is because there is no vertical displacement within the fault movement, only lateral movement resulting in no displacement of the water. In an enclosed basin such as a lake, tsunamis are referred to as the initial wave produced by coseismic displacement from an earthquake, and the seiche as the <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> within the lake.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power factor}} of {{induction}} motors varies with load, typically from around 0.85 or 0.90 {{at full load}} to as low as about 0.20 at no-load, due to stator and rotor leakage and magnetizing reactances. Power factor can be improved by connecting capacitors either on an individual motor basis or, by preference, on a common bus covering several motors. For economic and other considerations, power systems are rarely power factor corrected to unity power factor.Power capacitor application with harmonic currents requires power system analysis to avoid <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> between capacitors and transformer and circuit reactances. [...] Common bus power factor correction is recommended to minimize resonant risk and to simplify power system analysis.|$|E
30|$|Electromagnetic {{transient}} simulation [64] is a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation {{technique used}} to assess stresses and phenomena caused by switching actions, <b>harmonics,</b> <b>resonance,</b> surges, and other high-speed dynamics. While this simulation technique assesses many metrics from a single simulation run, {{it is also the}} most computationally intense. This has commonly limited practice of this simulation technique to short time spans, reduced-order models [65], or average-value models [66]; however, due to the wealth of information arising from this simulation type, it is an important simulation technique and commonly used after steady-state assessments have been made [67].|$|R
30|$|When {{studying}} the harmonic emission of a wind farm, two separate issues should be considered: the harmonic emissions from individual wind turbines and the propagation {{from the individual}} wind turbines through the collection grid to the public grid. The harmonic emission from an individual wind turbine is discussed in the previous section. The impact of the wind farm on the propagation has not been studied, but <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> have been widely studied [1, 3, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The parallel resonance has the main impact on the emission of the farm, thus the emission into the grid is several times {{higher than that of}} the individual turbines.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{dependence of the}} interlayer conductivity of a layered Fermi liquid in a magnetic field that is tilted away from the normal to the layers is considered. For both quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional systems resonances occur when the frequency is a harmonic of the frequency at which the magnetic field causes the electrons to oscillate on the Fermi surface within the layers. The intensity of the different <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> varies significantly with {{the direction of the}} field. The resonances occur for both coherent and weakly incoherent interlayer transport and so their observation does not imply the existence of a three-dimensional Fermi surface.

50|$|Bösendorfer {{built the}} first Imperial in 1900, {{following}} a suggestion by composer Ferruccio Busoni to build a model with an extended range. Busoni sought to extend the range to accommodate his transcription of the Chaconne from Johann Sebastian Bach's Partita in D minor for solo violin. The Bösendorfer Imperial features 97 keys: a full eight octaves. This {{is in contrast to}} their other extended model, the Bösendorfer 225, which has 92 keys (down to F0). The extra keys, which are all at the bass end of the keyboard (that is, to the left), are colored black so that the pianist can tell them apart from the normal keys of an 88-key piano. They were originally covered with a removable panel to prevent a pianist from accidentally playing the extra notes. While the keys are seldom used, the extra bass strings create additional <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> that contributes to an overall richer sound. Compositions have been written specifically to utilize the extra keys.|$|E
50|$|The XB-46's {{first flight}} {{occurred}} 2 April 1947 {{after a month}} of taxi testing, and lasted ninety minutes as the bomber departed the Convair plant in San Diego, California for Muroc Army Airfield in the high desert. The pilot praised its handling qualities. Basic flight testing took place for five months, and by September 1947 it was concluded after 127 hours aloft on 64 flights by both the Convair company and AAF test pilots. Stability and control were excellent but there were engineering problems with engine de-icing, the cabin air system, and vertical oscillations caused by <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> between the wing and spoilers. There was also concern regarding {{the ability of the}} three man crew to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency, since the exit plan relied on the pneumatic system to hold the main door open against the airstream. The aircraft was accepted on 7 November and delivered on 12 November 1947.|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, Ginastera {{uses his}} {{signature}} guitar chord twice in this piece, a tied thirty second note ascending arpeggiation of E-A-D-G-B-E, representing the open strings of the gaucho’s guitar. This chord, with its intensely Argentine connotations, appears [...] "like sherbet between courses, to cleanse the palate" [...] (Alison Dalton, violinist, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, interview by editor of this article, 1996) throughout Ginastera’s career, {{in nearly all}} of the genres in which he composed. Though a similar <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> is achieved by playing nearly any series of four perfect fourths and a major third, the ubiquitous chord is most frequently spelled as above in Ginastera's compositions, regardless of the tonal center (or lack thereof) of the piece in which the chord appears. Consequently, if [...] "Triste" [...] is to be performed in transposition, the performers must consider the specific sonority of the E-A-D-G-B-E chord and whether it too should be transposed or left as written.|$|E

The style is highly unusual and foreign to most listeners, who typically find it inaccessible and amelodic. In throat singing, the natural <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> of the lips and mouth are tuned to select certain overtones. The style was first recorded by Ted Levin, who helped catalogue {{a number of}} different styles. These include borbannadir (which is compared to the sound of a flowing river), sygyt (similar to whistling), xoomii, chylandyk (likened to chirping crickets) and ezengileer (like a horse's trotting).

40|$|International audienceA {{study of}} Pc- 5 {{magnetic}} pulsations {{using data from}} the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) was carried out. Three-component dynamic magnetic field spectrograms have been used to survey ULF pulsation activity for the approximate fourteen month lifetime of CRRES. Two-hour panels of dynamic spectra were examined to find events which fall into two basic categories: 1) toroidal modes (fundamental and <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonances)</b> and 2) poloidal modes, which include compressional oscillations. The occurence rates were determined as a function of L value and local time. The main result is a comparable probability of occurence of toroidal mode oscillations on the dawn and dusk sides of the magnetosphere inside geosynchronous orbit, while poloidal mode oscillations occur predominantly along the dusk side, consistent with high azimuthal mode number excitation by ring current ions. Pc- 5 pulsations following Storm Sudden Commencements (SSCs) were examined separately. The spatial distribution of modes for the SSC events was consistent with the statistical study for the lifetime of CRRES. The toroidal fundamental (and <b>harmonic)</b> <b>resonances</b> are the dominant mode seen on the dawn-side of the magnetosphere following SSCs. Power is mixed in all three components. In the 21 dusk side SSC events {{there were only a few}} examples of purely compressional (two) or radial (one) power in the CRRES study, a few more examples of purely toroidal modes (six), with all three components predominant in about half (ten) of the events.

The process of converting the stock Jaguar XJS coupé into the H&E Convertible included the post-production removal of the roof, cutting the body in several sections, the addition of steel reinforcements behind the driver's seat, and 20 lb weights placed just behind the headlights to eliminate <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> caused by the significant modifications to the car. H&E XJS convertibles are easily identified by the lower folding top, as well as two small badges located just behind the front wheels. The later Jaguar full convertible had a heavier padded top that did not fold into as small a bundle when in the lowered position, but retained nearly all of the original components of the coupé.|$|E
50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize <b>harmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from {{the heat of the}} intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique 14mm AF 32 Autolite sparkplugs specified because of their smaller size (5/8 inch wrench vs. 13/16 inch wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.|$|E
5000|$|Alpha Wave Movement (established 1992 in Miami, Florida) is the {{electronic}} music project of Gregory T. Kyryluk. Alpha Wave Movement's musical style {{can be considered}} ambient, new-age, some space rock, the classic 1970s period German style electronic music otherwise known as Berlin school {{as well as the}} ambient aesthetics of Brian Eno, and Steve Roach. Releases such A Distant Signal and Terra have more ambient space elements than other Alpha Wave Movement releases. Beyond Silence has more space rock elements and has a more rhythmic feel in their overall music compositions. In 2007 Alpha Wave Movement released The Mystic & The Machine, a musical exploration of 1970's era romantic progressive rock performed on synthesizers with the addition of UK musician Steve Hillman on electric guitar. The influences of Genesis, Ozric Tentacles (1980s era), and Camel are quite obvious and intended and shows yet another side of Alpha Wave Movement's composition. Alpha Wave Movement's music is semi electronic-based, utilizing digital synthesizers and MIDI to create its sonic explorations. Aside from the music influences nature and natural landscapes are a continuous source of inspiration for compositions. Alpha Wave Movement has performed at the Ambient Ping Canada and at the Gathering Room USA. Alpha Wave Movement has released music on the Dutch label Groove Unlimited, Silent Records (USA), Waveform Records (USA), Spiralight (USA), Anodize (USA)and on the private label <b>Harmonic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Recordings. Alpha Wave Movement's other projects include Thought Guild, Open Canvas, Subtle Shift and a solo release as Gregory Kyryluk.The latest release from Alpha Wave Movement is entitled [...] "Soniq Variants"(2011). The release is based conceptually on the use of Ensoniq synthesizers solely for the compositions. Ensoniq was an American manufacturer that spearheaded early affordable synthesizer workstation's the first of which was the ESQ-1 in 1986. Music on this release was composed primarily on the ESQ-1, VFX-SD, SQ-R and a DP4 all of which were made by Ensoniq. Additional use of a Novation synthesizer was also incorporated to add some timbral variation.The year 2012 arrived with a new electronic music project by Gregory Kyryluk under the alias of Subtle Shift. This new project dives head into the ambient dub waterways. Featuring a more sublime percussive foundation, environmental soundscapes. Drawn on the influences of the Detroit and European creative pioneering spirits such as Rod Modell and Yagya, GAS as well as incorporating 1970s electro aesthetics. To date there are four full length releases by Within Reason on the Anodize and <b>Harmonic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Recording labels.In 2014 {{the electronic}}a world fusion project Open Canvas(essentially Gregory Kyryluk) had a track from the Waveform Records release [...] "Indumani" [...] featured in the internationally popular gothic horror show True Blood.

Conversely, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse at the distances of a typical living room.|$|R
