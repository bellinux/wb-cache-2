5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric <b>junction</b> <b>boxes.</b> In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} a <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> called the Korg PS-3050, which was for {{controlling}} up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by routing a PS-3001 cable from the keyboard to the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and then routing separate cables from the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.|$|R

25|$|Usually, the {{stronger}} a metal is, the less pliable it is. This {{is not the}} case with copper.

25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

2500|$|Fused {{plugs and sockets}} {{of various}} {{proprietary}} and non-interchangeable types are found in older public buildings in the UK, where {{they are used to}} feed AC electric wall clocks. They are smaller than conventional sockets, commonly being made to fit BESA <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> and are often of very low profile. Early types were available fused in both poles, later types fused in the line only and provided an earth pin. Most are equipped with a retaining screw or clip to prevent accidental disconnection. The prevalence of battery powered quartz controlled wall clocks has meant that this connector is rarely seen in new installations for clock use. [...] However, it has found use where a low profile fused connector is required and is still available. [...] A relatively common example of such a use is to supply power to an illuminated mirror that has limited clearance from the wall.|$|E
2500|$|Along a 50-metre {{length of}} tunnel, the {{normally}} 0.4-metre thick tunnel lining {{was reduced to}} a mean depth of 0.17metres, with the thinnest area being 0.02metres. [...] The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres. [...] Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. [...] In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel and, completed in less than a month, the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.|$|E
