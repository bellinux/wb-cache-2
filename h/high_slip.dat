Figure 4 (e) {{suggests that}} the area of <b>higher</b> <b>slip</b> velocity (orange) covering SAs in the preseismic stage tends to be larger than in the interseismic stage as shown in Fig. 4 (d), and there is no region in which the slip velocity is less than 0.1 Vp 1. Slip velocity in LA (indicated by green curve in the top of Fig. 2 (c)) becomes higher due to the preseismic slip, especially about one year before the megathrust earthquake. These results mean that preseismic slip of LA promotes higher moment release rates of VLF due to its <b>higher</b> <b>slip</b> velocity.|$|R

In this computation, we assume a pre-slip region, where stress has already lowered quasi-statically to the dynamic friction level. And due to the pre-slip, we suppose a stress concentration {{at the edge of}} preslip area. Then a dynamic rupture starts at a certain point {{on the rim of the}} pre-slip region. We could observe a rupture front focusing that causes <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> rate pulse. We also observed a high frequency pulse in ground velocity seismogram. We computed a double pre-slip model, where two pre-slip region exist, and found that multiple pre-slips enhances this effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect that mechanical stresses acting under the slipping driving wheels of agricultural equipment have on the soil’s pore system and water flow process (surface runoff generation during extreme event). The field experiment simulated low slip (1 %) and <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> (27 %) on a clay loam. The stress on the soil surface and changes in the amounts of water flowing from macropores were simulated using the Tires/tracks And Soil Compaction (TASC) tool and the MACRO model, respectively. Taking a 65 kW tractor on a clay loam as a reference, results showed that an increase in slip of the rear wheels from 1 % to 27 % caused normal stress to increase from 90. 6 kPa to 104. 4 kPa at the topsoil level, and the maximum shear contact stress to rise drastically from 6. 0 kPa to 61. 6 kPa. At 27 % slip, topsoil was sheared and displaced over a distance of 0. 35 m. Excessive normal and shear stress values with <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> caused severe reductions of the soil’s macroporosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water quantities flowing from topsoil macropores. Assuming that, under conditions of intense rainfall on sloping land, a loss in vertical water flow would mean an increase in surface runoff, we calculated that a rainfall intensity of 100 mm h- 1 and a rainfall duration of 1 h would increase the runoff coefficient to 0. 79 at low slip and to 1. 00 at <b>high</b> <b>slip,</b> indicating that 100 % of rainwater would be transformed into surface runoff at <b>high</b> <b>slip.</b> We expect that these effects have a significant impact on soil erosion and floods in steeper terrain (slope > 15 °) and across larger surface areas (> 16 m 2) than those included in our study...|$|E
30|$|Slip {{distribution}} The slip distribution {{was changed}} {{in two different}} ways. First, the Kostrov slip model with healing was used because this model allows variable rise time and slip amplitude, but constant stress drop. Second, smaller areas with <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> amplitudes and high stress drops were called asperities.|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} body wave seismograms, we {{show that}} the rupture speed on the Main Kunlun Fault during the Mw 7. 8 2001 Kunlunshan, Tibet, earthquake was highly variable and the rupture process consisted of three stages. In the first stage, the rupture accelerated from rest to an average speed of 3. 3 km/s over a distance of 120 km. The rupture then propagated for another 150 km at an apparent rupture speed exceeding the P wave speed. In the final stage, the earthquake fault bifurcates, and the rupture front slowed down. The region of highest rupture velocity is found {{to coincide with the}} region of <b>highest</b> fault <b>slip,</b> has the longest slip duration, and is where off-fault ground cracking is observed in the field. Stress drops are found to be higher in regions of higher rupture speeds. The greatest concentration of aftershocks is located near the fault bifurcation zone and hence coincides with the region of <b>highest</b> fault <b>slip,</b> <b>highest</b> stress drop and highest rupture velocity. The fault width is no more than 10 km in most places and is about 20 km in the region of <b>highest</b> <b>slip.</b> This narrow fault width is attributed to the fact that crust below this depth is sufficiently warm not to permit brittle failure to occur. The remarkable similarity of this earthquake with the 1906 California earthquake, in spite of occurring in very different tectonic regimes, is discussed.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{variation}} of interfacial {{tension of the}} liquid systems can be also obtained from Fig.  6. According to Fig.  6, {{it is observed that}} the enhancement of the interfacial tension leads to the reduction of slip velocity in horizontal section, while it results in <b>higher</b> <b>slip</b> velocities in vertical section of the column. It is because of the formation of smaller drops in systems with lower interfacial tension and the variation of holdup which is discussed in Sect. “Effect of operating parameters on holdup”.|$|R
30|$|Under {{the applied}} stress field, the north–northwest-striking Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults {{on the eastern}} and western margins of the step-over, respectively, are {{generally}} well-oriented for slip and dilation. At the southern margin of the step-over, the Neal fault bends[*]~[*] 10 ° westward and thereby has relatively <b>higher</b> <b>slip</b> and dilation tendency to the north than to the south, indicating a higher potential for fracture permeability and fluid flow. Two northwest-striking faults, which have the <b>highest</b> <b>slip</b> and dilation tendency of faults within the step-over, intersect with the Neal fault in this area as well. This collocation of the high intersection density within the step-over, {{as well as the}} intersection between optimally oriented smaller faults and an optimally oriented section of the Neal fault, results in the highest geothermal favorability within the Neal Hot Springs 3 D geothermal potential map. As a result of the highest density of well data and 2 D seismic reflection data through this area, the geologic geometries here are relatively well constrained (Fig.  8 b). The four production wells intersect the Neal fault within the middle Miocene mafic Columbia River Group volcanic section in this area, and the Quaternary silica sinter lies directly up-dip along the Neal fault from this high potential zone, suggesting that this area transmits geothermal fluids to the production wells, surficial hot springs, and sinter terrace (Fig.  15).|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{magnitude}} and slip distribution of the 1952 Kamchatka earthquake (MW 8. 8 – 9. 0) using constraints from the 1952 Kamchatka tsunami. Our new field data provide more comprehensive coverage of the near-field tsunami than had been available to date. We {{examine the effects of}} internal slip distribution within complex earthquake ruptures on near-field tsunami runup and evaluate some of the limitations of this approach. Our approach compares tsunami-deposit distribution with simulated runup from tsunamis generated by different configurations of seafloor deformation from hypothetical earthquakes resembling that of the 1952 Kamchatka earthquake. We identify areas of <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> because different distributions of seafloor deformation result in variations in tsunami runup in the near field. Mapped deposits and local observations of the 1952 Kamchatka tsunami indicate that near-field runup in central Kamchatka was consistently less than 10 m (averaging 6 m), while south Kamchatka to the northern Kuril Islands had more variability and higher average runup (8 m runup in South Kamchatka and 10 m runup in the northern Kuril Islands). Our simulations show that in order to produce the distribution of runup indicated by tsunami deposits and historical observations, the 1952 earthquake had regions of <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> off the coast of southern Kamchatka, and the location of <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> is shallower in the subduction zone than previously interpreted...|$|E

40|$|A {{simultaneous}} inversion {{method of}} strong motion seismograms and geodetic data for inferring earthquake rupture process was developed. We assumed a source model composed of many point-sources of which slip vectors and rupture times are unknown parameters. In addition to observed data, we introduced smoothing constraints to determine many parameters without instability. Since the least-squares solution {{depends on the}} relative weights of the smoothing constraints to a data misfit function, we determined their values by minimizing Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (ABIC). By using ABIC, we can objectively choose a unique model. This inversion method {{was applied to the}} Naganoken-Seibu, Japan, earthquake of 1984. Dividing a 15 x 10 km fault into 150 subfaults, we obtained the minimum ABIC model with a seismic moment of 2. 7 X los dyne cm. This model has a slip peak in the eastern and shallow area of the assumed fault. The <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> area is just under the areas where thrown-out boulders were found by Umeda et al. (1987) and Iio & Yoshioka (1988). Comparing the aftershock distribution with the estimated slip distribution, we found that the <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> area had few aftershocks. This suggests that aftershocks are caused by the stress generated in the marginal region around the main shock slip. The inversion analysis also revealed that there was a slight change in slip angle during the earthquake. The <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> area has some amount of dip-slip component while the slips in the other areas are almost purely right-lateral. Key words: ABIC, rupture process, simultaneous inversion, smoothing constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|The Swedish road {{administration}} {{requested that}} an independent organization facilitate friction tests with {{several types of}} friction measuring devices. These tests were done on the following three surfaces: macro rough and micro smooth ice, macro- and micro smooth ice and macroand micro rough ice. The objective was to evaluate lateral low slip measuring devices against traditional longitudinal <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> devices. This was done by evaluating how they measure road grip, i. e. friction differences between road surfaces and the measuring tire. Tests were performed on Lake Kakel near Arjeplog, northern Sweden on March 18 th, 2008. Weather conditions were stable with ice temperatures between - 4 °C (24. 8 °F) and - 3 °C (26. 6 °F). Tests showed that changes on the ice surfaces were readily detected with {{all four of the}} lateral low slip friction measurement devices and the two longitudinal <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> devices. Friction resolutions were higher with low lateral slip devices compared to high longitudinal slip devices. The tires on the devices were of different types and are the main reason for the difference in friction resolution. One major difference was detected; the lateral low slip method measured higher friction between its regular winter tire and the macro rough, micro smooth surfacecompared to the friction on the macro- and micro rough ice. Longitudinal <b>high</b> <b>slip</b> devices measured higher friction between its industrial friction tire and macro- and micro rough ice. Capacity to measure friction in curves was only displayed by the high longitudinal slip devices.

50|$|The other {{function}} of anti-roll bars is to tune the handling balance of a car. Understeer or oversteer {{behavior can be}} tuned out by changing {{the proportion of the}} total roll stiffness that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the front increases the proportion of the total load transfer that the front axle reacts to—and decreases the proportion that the rear axle reacts to. In general, this makes the outer front wheel run at a comparatively <b>higher</b> <b>slip</b> angle, and the outer rear wheel to run at a comparatively lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the rear axle has the opposite effect and decreases understeer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Non-slip socks {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{as a means of}} preventing accidental falls due to slips. This study compared the relative slip resistance of commercially available non-slip socks with other foot conditions, namely bare feet, compression stockings and conventional socks, in order to determine any traction benefit. Methods Phase one involved slip resistance testing of two commercially available non-slip socks and one compression-stocking sample through an independent blinded materials testing laboratory using a Wet Pendulum Test. Phase two of the study involved in-situ testing among healthy adult subjects (n = 3). Subjects stood unsupported on a variable angle, inclined platform topped with hospital grade vinyl, in a range of foot conditions (bare feet, non-slip socks, conventional socks and compression stockings). Inclination was increased incrementally for each condition until slippage of any magnitude was detected. The platform angle was monitored using a spatial orientation tracking sensor and slippage point was recorded on video. Results Phase one results generated through Wet Pendulum Test suggested that non-slip socks did not offer better traction than compression stockings. However, in phase two, slippage in compression stockings was detected at the lowest angles across all participants. Amongst the foot conditions tested, barefoot conditions produced the <b>highest</b> <b>slip</b> angles for all participants indicating that this foot condition provided the <b>highest</b> <b>slip</b> resistance. Conclusion It is evident that bare feet provide better slip resistance than non-slip socks and therefore might represent a safer foot condition. This study did not explore whether traction provided by bare feet was comparable to 'optimal' footwear such as shoes. However, previous studies have associated barefoot mobilisation with increased falls. Therefore, it is suggested that all patients continue to be encouraged to mobilise in appropriate, well-fitting shoes whilst in hospital. Limitations of this study in relation to the testing method, participant group and sample size are discussed. </p...|$|R
