5|$|Zhu's close {{affiliation}} with Mao Zedong began in 1928 when, under {{the assistance of}} Chen Yi and Lin Biao, Zhu defected from Fan Shisheng's protection and marched his army of 10,000 men to Jiangxi and the Jinggang Mountains. Here Mao had formed a soviet in 1927, and Zhu began building up his army <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Army, consolidating and expanding the Soviet areas of control.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hollamby and {{his family}} moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> House, embarking on {{projects}} to renovate and restore it. A great fan of the house's original inhabitant, he also involved himself in the early activities of the William Morris Society, which held a number of meetings at the property. Awarded an OBE for his career in 1970, from 1969 to 1981 Hollamby worked as Director of Architecture, Planning and Development for the London Borough of Lambeth, before moving {{to work for the}} London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985. He continued restoring Red House in later life, opening it up to visitors and establishing the Friends of Red House charity in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Since NIU got {{the ball}} to start the game, Kent State got it to start the second half and {{got the ball}} at their own 47 after a 28-yard return by Josh Boyle. Kent State got the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> zone, but {{ultimately}} settled for a field goal which cut NIU's lead to 4 points. Northern Illinois' prolific offense continued their scoring by executing a 10-play, 75-yard drive highlighted by a 44-yard run by Lynch on a 4th and 1. Lynch would run it {{into the end zone}} for a 1-yard touchdown three plays later. After the Golden Flashes went three-and-out, the Huskies scored, this time via a 29-yard field goal by Sims.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{offensive}} {{drive of}} the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a personal foul, which added 15yards {{to the end of}} the pass. Another long pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> zone, and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan. With 8:15 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech narrowed Boston College's lead to just threepoints.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{opponent}} in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No.12-ranked Ball State Cardinals, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. Ball State was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game; Buffalo in its history was 0–5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls struck first with a touchdown {{late in the first}} quarter; Ball State responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10–7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter. Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having driven <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> zone, the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won the game 42–24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked {{opponent in}} nine attempts.|$|E

5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{regiment}} left their camp for Lyttelton and embarked on the transport ships HMNZT Tahiti and HMNZT Athenic. Leaving the same day, {{they arrived at}} Wellington the next afternoon, and disembarked the troops. On 14 October they boarded the transports again and set sail. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting {{to be joined by}} the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sea, and the Suez Canal.

5|$|On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for {{the first}} time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to {{activate}} Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|E

5|$|Snetkov {{was born}} on 27 February 1925 in Saratov, and {{graduated}} from Pugachyov's School No. 2. He was drafted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Army in 1942 and in October 1943 graduated from accelerated courses at the 2nd Kiev Self-Propelled Artillery School as a junior lieutenant. As commander of an SU-152 self-propelled gun in the 9th Separate Guards Breakthrough Tank Regiment of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 38th Army, Snetkov saw his first combat west of Rozhiv in the Battle of Kiev on 25 November, during which his crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a Tiger tank and two guns. For his actions, Snetkov received the Order of the Red Star on 12 December. As the advance westwards across Ukraine continued into the winter, he and his regiment fought in the Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive and the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive {{as part of the}} 38th Army. During the latter operation, on 26 January, his crew was reported by a superior to have engaged a German tank column of about 20 tanks and destroyed three, one of which was a Tiger, on the LipovetsRososhe road. For this action, Snetkov received the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} conducted training until 24 September, {{when they}} received embarkation orders.

5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E

5|$|With 9:28 {{remaining}} in the quarter, Nebraska's second possession of the game mirrored its first. The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw, but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt. Following the kick, Virginia Tech took over at its 28-yard line. The Hokies performed better than their first possession, picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine. Druckenmiller then completed a first-down throw that pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time. Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play, then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first down. Now at the Nebraska 20-yard line, Oxendine ran for a yard, pushing the Hokies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> zone. On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone, Druckenmiller completed a 19-yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown—the game's first points. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead with 3:14 {{remaining in}} the first quarter. The drive covered 72 yards and had taken eight plays and 4:06 of game time.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b> zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E
