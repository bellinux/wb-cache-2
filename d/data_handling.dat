Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system to Earth in comparison to the closeness of Pluto to Earth, New Horizons sent back more data to Earth from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we focus}} on dynamic {{analyses}} that examine the <b>data</b> <b>handled</b> by programs and operating systems in order to divine the undocumented constraints and implementation details that determine their behavior in the field. First, we introduce a novel technique for uncovering the constraints actually used in OS kernels to decide whether a given instance of a kernel data structure is valid. Next, we tackle the semantic gap problem in virtual machine security: we present a pair of systems that allow, on the one hand, automatic extraction of whole-system algorithms for collecting information about a running system, and, on the other, the rapid identification of “hook points” within a system or program where security tools can interpose to be notified of security-relevant events. Finally, we present and evaluate a new dynamic measure of code similarity that examines {{the content of the}} <b>data</b> <b>handled</b> by the code, rather than the syntactic structure of the code itself. This problem has implications both for understanding the capabilities of novel malware as well as understanding large binary code bases such as operating system kernels. Ph. D...|$|R

25|$|The Spacecraft Bus is {{the primary}} support {{component}} of the James Webb Space Telescope, that hosts a multitude of computing, communication, propulsion, and structural parts, bringing the {{different parts of the}} telescope together. Along with the Sunshield, it forms the Spacecraft Element of the space telescope. The other two major elements of the JWST are the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) and the Optical Telescope Element (OTE). Region 3 of ISIM is also inside the Spacecraft Bus; region 3 includes ISIM Command and <b>Data</b> <b>Handling</b> subsystem and the MIRI cryocooler.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} carries two computer systems: the Command and <b>Data</b> <b>Handling</b> {{system and}} the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy, {{for a total of}} four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the Mongoose-V, a 12 MHz radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9boards. The software of the probe runs on Nucleus RTOS operating system.|$|E

25|$|While in {{hibernation}} mode in July 2012, New Horizons started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although {{it was originally}} planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator Alan Stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted {{to make sure that}} the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby. The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and <b>data</b> <b>handling</b> software was updated to address the problem of computer resets.|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and <b>Data</b> <b>Handling</b> Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E
2500|$|An ESB {{mediation}} flow {{is one of}} the [...] component {{types in}} a Service Component Architecture (SCA). Like any SCA component, the program accesses a mediation flow through exports that it provides, and the mediation flow forwards messages to other external services via imports. Special kinds of imports and exports for JMS, called JMS bindings, enable developers to specify the binding configuration and write <b>data</b> <b>handling</b> code. The mediation flow consists of a series of mediation primitives that manipulate messages as they flow through the bus.|$|E
5000|$|In machine {{learning}} and information retrieval, the cluster hypothesis is an assumption {{about the nature}} of the <b>data</b> <b>handled</b> in those fields, which takes various forms. In information retrieval, it states that documents that are clustered together [...] "behave similarly with respect to relevance to information needs". In terms of classification, it states that if points are in the same cluster, they are likely to be of the same class. There may be multiple clusters forming a single class.|$|R
