In 2008 there were 1,481 registered road vehicles and 49 percent of all households had a car. Cars are registered with ZN on the registration plates.

5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use.

5|$|In 2015, Otherside Entertainment, a new {{developer}} {{founded by}} Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans, {{announced a new}} entry in the series, entitled Underworld Ascendant. The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss, but this licensing agreement <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> to the Ultima name or greater IP, effectively orphaning Underworld from the Ultima series.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 Hezbollah {{decided to}} {{participate}} in elections, and Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of Iran, endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, Subhi al-Tufayli, contested this decision, {{which led to a}} schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> these values to groups who have relations with Israel.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E

The unique emblem of the Tortoise Club is the tortoise badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of the Tortoise emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E

5|$|The {{rest of the}} Snake River {{watershed}} {{borders on}} several other major Columbia River tributaries - mostly the Spokane River to the north, but also Clark Fork in Montana to the northeast and the John Day River to the west. Of these, the Clark Fork (via the Pend Oreille River) and the Spokane join the Columbia above the Snake, while the John Day joins downstream of the Snake, in the Columbia River Gorge. It is of note that the northeastern divide of the Snake River watershed forms the Idaho-Montana boundary, so the Snake River watershed <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> into Montana.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
