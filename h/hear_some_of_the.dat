25|$|In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair {{took place}} in Bethel, New York, which for many, {{exemplified}} the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Carlos Santana, Sly & The Family Stone, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred {{in other parts of}} the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in persuading his boss, Roy Featherstone, and Ron White, authoriser of EMI recordings, to allow Barrett to record {{with the company}} again. In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: [...] "What was decided was {{to see what was}} the strength of Syd's new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we'd do an album. If not, we'd call it a day..." [...] In a meeting at Barrett's flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner's production technique, Jones asked to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year's tapes; Barrett played him [...] "Swan Lee", [...] "Late Night", [...] "Rhamadam", [...] "Lanky (Parts One and Two)" [...] and [...] "Golden Hair". Of these, [...] "Swan Lee" [...] had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; [...] "Late Night" [...] did have vocals and, Jones remarked, [...] "a certain charm"; while [...] "Golden Hair" [...] was [...] "great". After the playbacks, Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones: [...] "Opel" [...] and [...] "Clowns and Jugglers" [...] (both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner), and the newly written [...] "Terrapin" [...] and [...] "Love You".|$|E

50|$|No reason {{has ever}} been given for the guilty plea, and despite giving it, Knight still refused to accept {{responsibility}} for her actions. At the sentencing hearing, Knight's lawyers requested that Knight be excused to avoid <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facts, but the application was refused. When Timothy Lyons took the stand and described the skinning and decapitation, Knight became hysterical and had to be sedated.|$|R

50|$|The band is {{a result}} of a lifelong {{friendship}} between Brian Harding and Jason Roberts, who formed it while attending Appalachian State University.
