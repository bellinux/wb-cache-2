50|$|Pimpewaug {{became one}} of the three {{original}} school districts in Wilton, all of which were formed in 1729. The location of the first schoolhouse is not known, but it may have been in the same location as the second schoolhouse, a few hundred yards south of the intersection of Danbury Road and Olmstead Hill Road. That location is just north of present-day Wilton High School and south of Allen's Meadow. Pimpewaug school met in August and September. For the rest of the year, children were employed on their families farms, which were the original and primary industry in the area until well into the 19th century. The Norwalk River supplied power for sawmills and gristmills. By 1809, Cannondale resident Thomas Cole used Norwalk River power for a machine to <b>form</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs for carriages. His brothers, Sherman and Curtis Cole, and nephews later ran the business under the name Cole, Nichols & Company. The plant was probably on the northeast and southeast corners of the intersection of Seeley and Danbury roads, with a sawmill, hub shop, blacksmith shop and a shed for trimming or stripping, where wagons, chaises and sulkies were built. In the late 19th century, the business was replaced at the site by the D&L Lockwood wire mill.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. By {{applying}} NC {{system with}} three axes ganged function to M 1432 universal cylindrical grinding machine, a NC grinding machine with two moving axes and one circumrotating axis ganged function is designed and developed. Besides two moving axes ganged function, this machine {{has a special}} function of driving the <b>form</b> <b>wheel</b> dresser to circumrotate around the Y axis. Ordinary grinding machine with two axes ganged function can’t machine complicated parts such as seaming roll with steep gradient groove. But a grinding machine with this special function can do this by precisely dressing the <b>form</b> <b>wheel</b> with various aspheric curves. With the set-in PLC function of NUM 1020 NC system and the correlative parameters to be respectively setup, the new machine {{can be used to}} machine some complicated parts such as seaming roll. The system receives machining process codes which is pretreated by computer firstly and dresses the <b>form</b> <b>wheel</b> in DNC mode, then machines parts with the <b>form</b> <b>wheel</b> later...|$|E

50|$|A {{cylindrical}} grinder has {{a grinding}} (abrasive) wheel, two centers {{that hold the}} workpiece, and a chuck, grinding dog, or other mechanism to drive the work. Most cylindrical grinding machines include a swivel {{to allow for the}} forming of tapered pieces. The wheel and workpiece move parallel to one another in both the radial and longitudinal directions. The abrasive wheel can have many shapes. Standard disk-shaped wheels can be used to create a tapered or straight workpiece geometry while <b>formed</b> <b>wheels</b> are used to create a shaped workpiece. The process using a <b>formed</b> <b>wheel</b> creates less vibration than using a regular disk-shaped wheel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Gear form {{grinding}} is a finish machining method for hard tooth {{surface with a}} <b>form</b> <b>wheel.</b> Wheel dressing is an important process in gear {{form grinding}}, and affects the precision of the ground gear directly. Based on the envelope theory the mathematical model of the dressed wheel surface {{was built in the}} case of wheel dressing errors. Then the real profile of the ground tooth in the transverse plan was solved and its deviations from the designed profile were evaluated. Finally the effects of each dressing error on the precision of the ground gear were analyzed using the proposed mathematical model. The results provided theoretical foundation for the precision control during manufacturing a gear form grinding machine. A grinding experiment was implemented using the gear form grinding machine and the ground gear was measured by a three-coordinate measuring machine. The measure result indicated that the accuracy grade of the ground gear achieved 4 (ISO 1328 - 1 : 1997) ...|$|E

In {{order to}} {{describe}} the forming grinding principle of screw rotor, the mathematical model of screw rotor's helical groove and <b>forming</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> are established by differential geometry theory and numerical analysis method.

To optimize the traditional method of calculating <b>forming</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> by known rotor end section profile, a numerical analysis method (Accumulated Chord Length Parameter Method) has been presented in detail. This method can improve the efficiency and reliability of the calculation of <b>forming</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> axial profile.
