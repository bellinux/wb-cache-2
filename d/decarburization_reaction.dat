40|$|One of {{the main}} goals in oxygen {{steelmaking}} process {{is to reduce the}} carbon concentration of the liquid iron effectively. It is understood {{that the majority of the}} carbon removal reaction occurs in the emulsion phase via the reaction between metal droplets and the slag phase. An improved understanding of this reaction and the factors controlling the overall rate should provide better control of the process and increase the productivity. In the literature, there is limited knowledge on how to relate the carbon removal rate within the droplets to the overall kinetics of the process under full scale operating conditions.

This paper also critically evaluated the current knowledge on the kinetics of <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> in the emulsion phase and discussed the repercussions of the new model for industrial practices. The decarburization model, in conjunction with the industrial data, indicates that the decarburization rates in the emulsion phase reaches up to approximately 60 % of the overall decarburization rate during the main blow. It was found that the residence time of droplets as well as <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> rate via emulsified droplets was strong function of bloating behavior of metal droplets in the emulsion phase. The estimated residence times of the metal droplets in the emulsion were between 0. 4 to 45 s throughout the blow.

40|$|The {{decarburization}} kinetics {{have been}} investigated for an austenitic Fe- 0. 81 w/o C alloy {{in the presence of}} a wustite scale exposed to a carbon dioxide atmosphere or vacuum at 950 ~ During the stage of linear reaction kinetics in carbon dioxide, iron oxidation was approximately tenfold more rapid than carbon oxidation. The latter reaction occurred predominately with carbon dioxide rather than by reduction of wustite. The primary rate-controlling steps in <b>decarburization</b> were <b>reaction</b> steps at the alloy surface with a small resiatance possibly occurring to the passage of carbon oxides by pores in the scale. The max imum area affected by porosity in a scale was 2 - 3 %.

40|$|The {{development}} of a global model for oxygen steelmaking and its validation against industrial data {{has been reported in}} Part 1 of this paper. Part 2 of this paper explained the model {{development of}} <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> of emulsified droplets and discussed the effects of bloating behaviour of metal droplets on the overall kinetics of the process. Part 3 of this paper focussed on the development of one sub-model on the <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> in the impact zone and critically evaluates the important process variables affecting the decarburization kinetics. Decarburization rates in the impact zone were calculated using the semi-empirical relationships developed from experimental results. Based on previous experimental studies, both diffusion through the gas phase and surface control were considered in the rate calculations. The model was validated against experimental data from Belton and Sain, and against plant data from Cicutti et al. The model developed was consistent with the experimental and plant data, and provided a reasonable basis for predicting the decarburization of iron in the impact region of oxygen steelmaking. The model predicted that the decarburization rate is sensitive to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the impact zone. As the partial pressure of oxygen decreased from 26. 4 to 16. 2 kPa, the model predicted that that the reaction rate of decarburization via oxygen decreased from 202 to 134 kg/min. The model predicted that approx. 40 % of decarburization takes place in the impact zone during the main blow...|$|E

The main reaction occurs on the free surface by direct oxidation of carbon at the gas-liquid interface with producing the carbon monoxide. It may be controlled by chemical kinetics and mass transport steps. When the high speed jet is impinging, the extremely large amounts of droplets are generated. Because the reaction is mainly occurred on the surface of droplet, it is important to simulate the reaction on a single iron droplet.

40|$|There is {{significant}} evidence that droplets generated in steelmaking "bloat" apparently {{due to the}} inability of gas generated from the decarburisation reaction {{to escape from the}} surface of liquid metal droplets. A model to describe this behavior was developed by Brooks, Subagyo, Coley and Pan based on their own experimental work and calculations and previous studies by Fruehan and co-workers. This approach has been successfully incorporated into an overall process model of oxygen steelmaking. The unique feature of this model is to evaluate the <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics of individual metal droplets in the emulsion and to compare with the overall kinetics of oxygen steelmaking. The model suggests that the droplets become bloated and remain in the emulsion for relatively long periods (30 + seconds). This paper will evaluate the effects of droplet size, ejection angle and volume fraction on the bloating behavior of droplets and critically examine the repercussions of the new theory on plant design and operation...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to predict the dissolution rate of added fluxes such as lime and dolomite as a sub-model of an overall kinetic model of top-blown oxygen steelmaking process. The calculation of dissolution rates included dimensionless analysis technique {{as well as the}} evolution of gas generated due to <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> during the blowing process. The progress of flux dissolution and the amount of slag generated were predicted as a function of saturation concentration of CaO and MgO in the slag, CO gas flow rate and the physical properties of slag throughout the blow. The results from the model were consistent with the plant data from the study of Cicutti et al. The influences of variations in solid particle size and flux addition rate on flux dissolution were also investigated. It has been shown in this study that the amount of flux dissolved in oxygen steelmaking process is accelerated if the addition rate of flux is increased or if the size of flux particle is decreased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The argon-hydrogen {{co-injection}} {{tests were}} carried out in a multifunction ladle furnace (LF) equipped with a hollow graphite electrode. About 80 kg low carbon steel were refined in LF, the argon-hydrogen gas mixtures were injected onto the melt through the hollow graphite electrode, the flow rates of the gas mixtures were 3 m 3 /h. Then, applying the plasma local equilibrium thermodynamics and metallurgical thermodynamics theories, a calculation model of argon-hydrogen plasma component concentration was established. Using this model, the particle densities of the argon-hydrogen system were calculated. The decarburization mechanisms during Ar-H 2 injection in LF with hollow graphite electrode were studied. The results show that, {{in the process of}} traditional LF refining, the carburetion reaction occurs with using the graphite electrode. When the argon-hydrogen was injected into LF, there was a <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> on the interface of the melt. Compared with the traditional LF, the carburetion rate reduces 33. 3 % at least. The partial pressure of C 2 H 2 produced by molecule hydrogen is far lower than that of CH 4 reacted by monatomic hydrogen. The possible main reactant gas is monatomic hydrogen and the main product is CH 4...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{steelmaking}} {{is complex}} {{because of the}} presence of multiple phases, many components, and the non-steady state/non-homogenous conditions within the process. The severe operating conditions make it difficult to take measurements and directly observe the process. Although some mathematical models have been developed to describe the kinetics of oxygen steelmaking, improve understanding of the system and optimize process control, existing theories have not been successfully applied under dynamic process conditions. For example, there is evidence that the period when the bloated droplets are suspended in the emulsion phase enhances the reaction areas, and the decarburization rates. In this study a computer based model has been developed that incorporates bloated droplet theory under dynamic conditions to evaluate its influence on the overall kinetics of the process. The process variables influencing the <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics considered in the model were hot metal, scrap and flux charges, hot metal, scrap and slag compositions, oxygen blowing conditions, temperature of the bath, flux dissolution, scrap melting, the droplet generation rate, droplet size, residence time of droplets in the emulsion, and decarburization rates in the emulsion and impact zones. These process variables were modelled individually. The equations involved in this model were solved numerically on the basis of parameters encountered in the operation of oxygen steelmaking furnaces. All the developed models were translated into computational code and linked to one another in this study. The global model was tested with actual data for a 200 t top-blown furnace under the full scale operating conditions. The model predictions proved that the carbon content of liquid iron agreed with the actual process data. The model suggests that 45 % of total carbon was removed via emulsified metal droplets and the remainder was removed from the impact zone during the entire blow. It was found that the residence time of droplets and the <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> rate via emulsified droplets, was a strong function of the bloating behavior of the droplets. The estimated residence times of the metal droplets in the emulsion were between 0. 4 and 45 seconds throughout the blow. The global model enabled a comparison of the decarburization rates in different reaction zones and provided a better understanding of the process variables affecting in each reaction zone. On the basis of this model, the decarburization rates in the emulsion phase reached 60 % of the overall decarburization rate during the main blow. These findings will provide a further theoretical understanding of the oxygen steelmaking process and provide a predictive tool for industrial applications. This development represents an original contribution to our understanding of steelmaking...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{levitation}} {{experiments have}} been conducted to study the decarburization kinetics of levitated steel droplets {{in order to determine}} the factors and relationships which control the rate of decarburization especially at C levels below 30 ppm. It was found from the experiments that (1) vacuum chamber pressure had a significant effect on the rate of decarburization when the carbon content was below 35 ppm; (2) sulfur did not show any significant effect on the rate of decarburization due to the strong stirring inside the droplet caused by magnetic levitation field; (3) the rate of decarburization of levitated droplets was 3 ppm/sec at (C) = 30 ppm which was 40 times higher than the overall rate of decarburization in the RH process at (C) 30 ppm; (4) high initial oxygen contents improved the rate of decarburization at high carbon contents. The following suggestions are made: (1) increase the amount of liquid steel droplets without increasing the size of the droplets; (2) increase the fraction of the amount of <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> inside the molten steel by gas and powder injection; (3) further reduce the partial pressure of CO and CO$ sb 2 $ gas in the gas phase.

40|$|MasterKinetics of {{carburization}} and/or oxidation {{of molten}} iron under reduced pressure by injecting CH 4 and/or CO 2 gas were investigated {{in order to}} control carbon and oxygen content dissolved in ultra-low carbon steel during vacuum treatment. 	The major <b>decarburization</b> <b>reaction</b> of C + O = CO(g) during vacuum treatment reduces the amount of carbon and oxygen according to the stoichiometry of the reaction (d(wt%O) /d(wt%C) = 4 / 3). It is strongly desirable, however, to be able to control carbon and oxygen independently so that the optimum final composition can be obtained in a smooth way. In the present study, the control of carbon and oxygen content in the melt at 1873 K was attempted by injecting CH 4 and CO 2 gas, respectively, under reduced pressure. Partial pressures of these gases were controlled by diluting with argon gas. Under the reduced pressure without injecting CH 4 or CO 2 gases, the expected stoichiometry of the reaction were confirmed (d(wt%O) /d(wt%C) = 4 / 3). While CH 4 was injected, an additional reaction of CH 4 (g) + O(ad) = CO(g) + 2 H 2 (g) occurred, therefore further deoxidation in the molten iron could be achieved (d(wt%O) /d(wt%C) > 4 / 3). When CO 2 was injected, a different additional reaction of CO 2 (g) = CO(g) + O occurred, therefore oxygen content in the molten iron increased. Based on experimental data in the present study, it was confirmed that decarburization and deoxidation reactions in melt are cooperated by the stoichiometric relationship and the independent control of carbon and oxygen in the melt is possible by this approach. Rates of decarburization and deoxidation {{in the present study were}} analyzed, and a possibility of applying this approach to practical operation was discussed...|$|E
