40|$|A new {{diaphragm}} and dual <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> {{system was}} designed {{for use in a}} crash cushion for high-speed race tracks. These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the crash cushion. The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the <b>guide</b> <b>rails.</b> The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> system was verified through a dynamic bogie test. The second prototype weighed 55 lbs less, developed a maximum resistive force of 212 kips, and absorbed a total of 929 kip-in. of energy, resulting in a <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> permanent deflection of 1 / 16 in.

40|$|Muscular {{force is}} the sum of unitary force {{interactions}} generated as filaments of myosins move forcibly along parallel filaments of actins, understanding that the free energy required comes from myosin-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Using results from conventional biochemistry, our own mutational studies, and diffraction images from others, we attempt, in molecular detail, an account of a unitary interaction, i. e., what happens after a traveling myosin head, bearing an ADP-Pi, reaches the next station of an actin filament in its path. We first construct a reasonable model of the myosin head and actin regions that meet to form the “weakly bound state”. Separately, we consider Holmes' model of the rigor state [Holmes, K.

40|$|Salt {{intrusion}} is undesired {{because it}} has negative effects for drinking water and agricultural water intakes. At the Krammer locks (Zeeland, the Netherlands) a complex system is integrated {{in the design of}} the lock which prevents salt intrusion very accurate. This effective reduction of salt intrusion is regrettably accompanied with high energy consumption, high operational costs and high maintenance costs. On top of that, the entire system needs big maintenance in 2 years (20 M euro) and an extensive expansion in 10 years (300 M euro). Since retaining the current system is very expensive, other options have been elaborated. A pilot project is carried out in the smallest lock of the complex. The pilot has as main objective to get insight in possibilities for a design in the much larger commercial locks. The objective of this study is to present a feasible design for a salt intrusion prevention system in the commercial locks. It should be comparably effective as the current system, while having lower energy consumption, lower construction costs, lower maintenance costs, lower operational costs and a higher lock capacity. After an analysis it became clear that this is possible by including a movable sill in the structure. A comparison with the design of the pilot and the current system must prove the abilities of the new design. The presence of a movable sill results in a height reduction of the air bubble- and water screens in the new design. The screens are both integrated in the movable sill. In operation, the sill moves vertically up and down once every tidal cycle of 12 hours. It allows ships to sail over it, while being positioned as high as possible. Above the top level of the sill, the integrated screens reduce the negative effects. In this way, the optimum reduction of water exchange is obtained. The design of the screens is partly based on the design of the pilot. It’s optimised by using other dimensions and reducing the required air pressure for the air bubble screens. After determining the governing loads on the structure, a dimensioning has led to the final design. The driving mechanism is located above water and controls the height of the sill via vertical steel tubes. The structure is integrated in the existing lock chamber, in which a <b>guiding</b> <b>rail</b> distributes the forces of the sill to the lock chamber. The design is first compared to the current situation. In this comparison it becomes clear that salt intrusion prevention of the current system can be matched closely. The reduction of fresh water loss by the system improves considerably and the capacity of the lock increases by a third. A comparison of the design with the design of the pilot is quantified as being approximately 20 % more effective, consuming 50 % less energy and being 30 % cheaper than a configuration with air bubble- and water screens only. The expected improvements of the design in this study show that it is an interesting design. The quantifications are obtained by calculations based on various assumptions. Before the design can be realised, there are quite a few important recommendations which need to be elaborated. The assumptions in the used calculation methods need attention especially. Nevertheless, the presented design shows that a movable sill is an interesting option, to which further studies seem worthwhile. Apart from a realisation in the Krammer locks, the design has a broader potential; the benefits hold for all locks with salt intrusion countermeasures installed. It’s especially interesting in deep locks or locks with an increasing mean water level. In that case the effectiveness may increase even more.

40|$|The lock {{complex at}} Terneuzen {{is the main}} {{entrance}} for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The {{construction of a new}} large lock at the lock complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between the existing locks. The ground level is situated at NAP + 6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP - 2. 85 meter. The new lock will have larger dimensions than the current locks. It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must {{be able to use the}} lock tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new lock head. (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete lock head including the gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the <b>guiding</b> <b>rail</b> and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the lock head has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the lock head, is the best conceivable option.
