Jim has learned the company's financial situation from Pam, but feigns uncertainty when asked <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> {{is likely to be}} interested in a buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings the idea of a buyout to Michael. While there he also reassures Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas.|$|E

When Le Batard asked if race {{was a factor in}} drafting, specifically <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> Beasley would be drafted as highly if he had the same numbers but were white (the discussion originated with Tyler Hansbrough's low draft projection despite his numbers). Bilas responded “this is stupid,” and proceeded to end the interview.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{interference}} in the Elimination Chamber match to prevent The Undertaker from winning, Shawn Michaels cut a promo on the next episode of Raw, stating that he interfered so that The Undertaker would agree to a rematch at WrestleMania XXVI to get revenge. The Undertaker accepted the match {{on the condition that}} <b>if</b> <b>Michaels</b> lost, he would have to retire, to which Michaels agreed. Two weeks later, the pair agreed to make the match a no countout, no disqualification match.|$|R

I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
500|$|... "Long John Peter" [...] {{contained}} several {{pop culture}} references. When Chris sees Anna {{for the first}} time, he starts singing the song [...] "Crazy for You", which was originally performed by Madonna in the film Vision Quest (1985). When Peter is fighting a British man, the title music from The Sea Hawk (1940), composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, is used. The episode imagines {{what it would be}} like <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> J. Fox, who has [...] Parkinson's disease, would star as Zorro. In a trailer for a film, the tune from Coldplay's [...] "Clocks" [...] is played.|$|E

[...] He later described Trevor as [...] "the person who's driven purely by desire, resentment, no thought for tomorrow whatsoever, completely id rather than ego-driven." [...] He stated that Trevor [...] "kills without remorse, like a true psychopath, but very sentimental for the right reasons when it suits him." ...|$|E

As a result, Michaels challenged Undertaker to a rematch of their WrestleMania XXV match at WrestleMania XXVI. Undertaker agreed on the term that <b>if</b> <b>Michaels</b> lost, he would retire from professional wrestling. A stipulation was added that the match would be contested under no disqualifications and no countouts. At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Michaels to extend his WrestleMania winning streak to 18-0 and Michaels was forced to retire.|$|R
500|$|At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg, I was asked <b>if</b> <b>Michael,</b> Eve and Lucifer were {{historical}} figures {{of the past and}} I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation [...] "work of art" [...] to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.|$|E
500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the music video, [...] "Every aspect of the 14-minute horror musical, {{directed}} with creepy-comical zest by John Landis, is beyond iconic, from Michael's red leather ensemble to the immortal (no pun) herky-jerky zombie dance and bwah-ha-ha Vincent Price narration." [...] Though the video was met with widespread praise, it was also criticized for its content. In 1982, the National Coalition on Television Violence (NCTV) classified {{more than half of}} 200 MTV music videos surveyed as [...] "too violent". Both [...] "Thriller" [...] and Jackson's duet with Paul McCartney, [...] "Say, Say, Say" [...] made the list. The Los Angeles Times quoted Dr. Thomas Radecki, chairman of the NCTV, as saying, [...] "It's not hard to imagine young viewers after seeing 'Thriller' saying, 'Gee, <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson can terrorize his girlfriend, why can't I do it too?' ...|$|E
500|$|... "Casual Friday" [...] {{was written}} by Anthony Q. Farrell and {{directed}} by Brent Forrester. The official website for The Office included two cut scenes from [...] "Casual Friday" [...] {{within a week of}} its original release. In the first 50-second clip, Jim welcomes Pam to her new sales desk with a gift of a model of an island with figures representing Jim, Pam and Dwight, who share the office pod together. Dwight insists he did not {{have anything to do with}} the gift and does not welcome Pam to the desk because she [...] "obscures my view of the shredder." [...] In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should [...] "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," [...] by threatening to quit <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> does not give their clients back. The others express doubt and wonder if they should keep quiet in order to protect their jobs.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the loss}} of Taylor, Schembechler {{questioned}} his decision to let the injured Taylor play: [...] "I suppose if I {{had to do it}} all over again, I probably should have started Elvis and let the chips fall where they may. To be honest with you, Taylor didn't throw a pass all week. He's got a bad arm right now. But he's a great competitor. He wanted to go. He felt he'd be able to throw the ball all right." [...] Schembechler added, [...] "Michael Taylor is a fifth-year quarterback. He's the leader of our team. Hell's afire, we send him out there with a bad arm. <b>If</b> <b>Michael's</b> healthy, you'll see a difference." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Garcia {{requested}} that the prisoners perform their Thriller routine at the annual Sinulog festival, a popular street-music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of baby Jesus. The nine-day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession. The mayor of Cebu, Tomas Osmena, refused to permit the request, stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail. [...] "I will not allow it even <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson joins them", he commented. Garcia had hoped that, by allowing the inmates {{to be a part}} of the Sinulog celebrations, Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme. [...] "By showing these highly disciplined inmates, perhaps we might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the mardi gras, but rather, Cebu is about leadership and good governance." [...] The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the Lumad Basakonon, a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years.|$|E
500|$|After a {{financial}} scandal in early 2003, the ALP backbencher Sherfield Bowen {{asked for a}} vote of no confidence in Bird's government on 19 May, calling for him to step down and [...] "accusing him of being involved corrupt practices and governing without accountability". When Bowen was threatened with being {{thrown out of the}} Party, he claimed that several other MPs and government ministers were prepared to resign if he was dismissed, including Joseph. The dispute remained unresolved, with Bowen accusing the government of vesting too much power in Senator Asot Michael; Bowen, Hilroy Humpheys, Bernard Percival and Longford Jeremy eventually all resigned from the ALP administration, with further suggestions that Joseph, as well as trade minister Gaston Brown, could also leave. Joseph eventually announced on 19 June, that he would resign <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> was not immediately removed; within a few hours, Michael's resignation had been formally tendered. Soon afterwards, Joseph was given the Economic Development and Investment Promotion portfolio, to hold {{at the same time as}} his Tourism and the Environment position.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{felt that}} the main story {{employed}} [...] "one of the show's most reliable running jokes". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode, {{and he wondered if}} [...] "this was a one-time thing, or <b>if</b> <b>Michael's</b> treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little." [...] Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it [...] "pleasant". While he noted that each of the three stories [...] "weren't flat out funny", he wrote that they were all [...] "enjoyable". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun.|$|R
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebbie's brother Michael died on June 25, 2009, after {{suffering}} a cardiac arrest. His memorial service was held twelve days later, on July 7, and the finale featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems [...] "We Are the World" [...] and [...] "Heal the World". The singalong featured Michael's siblings (including Rebbie) and the late singer's children. Following the service which was held at Los Angeles' Staples Center Rebbie, along with sisters Janet and La Toya, addressed fans at the nearby L.A. Live entertainment complex: [...] "We are extremely grateful for all the support. We love you all." [...] In the weeks following Michael's death, it was speculated by media sources that Rebbie would be the primary caregiver for her late brother's children, Prince, Paris, and Blanket. It was stated that even <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> and Rebbie's mother Katherine were granted custody of the children, Rebbie would care for the siblings {{on a day-to-day basis}} at the Jackson family's Encino home. Katherine was named the legal guardian of them in August 2009 after the death of Michael Jackson. In early 2011, Rebbie announced she'd begun recording for a new album, her first in 14 years. She also performed throughout the states with a set list that contains her best known songs, some of her brothers' songs, and some Motown classics.|$|E
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a complimentary review. He started {{by claiming that}} Awake was [...] "the best drama to come out the 2011–12 season on television, {{and one of the}} finest NBC dramas in years". He also wondered [...] "what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten-like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons, or 10, or even just one more year", Could Awake maintain this story for long and still be compelling?" [...] Bonaime wrote that it was [...] "better to have one great season and be remembered fondly". Bonaime claimed that the [...] "ending is quite smart, given that it never truly clarifies <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> was dreaming the whole time, or if Dr. Lee was right and that he {{was on the verge of}} completely snapping, which makes much more sense". He was also grateful that [...] "Awake decided to just go completely nuts with the last half of this episode". He claimed that the episode and series was [...] "different, a rare move, especially on network television". He claimed that [...] "Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD, people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure". He claimed that works with Awake should be [...] "rewarded" [...] and [...] "praised". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.0 out of 10".|$|E

500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a little out of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{directly}} <b>if</b> <b>Michael</b> Mukasey was a liar {{because he}} claimed that enhanced interrogation produced useful intelligence, Sen.

50|$|In {{the main}} event, three championships {{were on the}} line: Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship, and Yokozuna and Owen Hart's WWF Tag Team Championship. If Diesel had been pinned, he would have lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and <b>if</b> <b>Michaels</b> had been pinned he would have lost the Intercontinental Championship. On {{the night of the}} show the WWF {{announced}} that The British Bulldog had to replace Owen Hart in the match, as Hart was with his wife at the hospital, as she was giving birth to their second child. Near the end of the match it was revealed that this was just a storyline as Owen Hart rushed to the ring in full wrestling gear and interfered in the match. Moments later Diesel pinned Owen Hart to win the match and supposedly win the tag team championship, but it was later announced that while Diesel and Michaels did win the match they did not win the tag team championship as Owen Hart was not the legal man in the match.|$|R
