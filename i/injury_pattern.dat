50|$|Traumatic {{injury is}} viewed {{through the lens}} of modern {{traumatic}} injury patterns. “Many aspects of the Kerma <b>injury</b> <b>pattern</b> were comparable to clinical modern observations: males experienced a higher frequency of trauma, the middle-aged group exhibited the most trauma, the oldest age cohort revealed the least amount of accumulated injuries, a small group experienced multiple trauma and fractures occurred more frequently than dislocations or muscle pulls”. Parry fractures (often occur when an individual is fending off a blow from an attacker) are common. These do not necessarily result from assault, however, and Judd does acknowledge this. She does not use the same parsing strategy when considering Colles' fractures (of the wrist, usually occur when falling onto one’s hands) may result from being pushed from a height rather than interpersonal violence, and this is not acknowledged.|$|E

The characteristics of injuries and outcomes of vertical deceleration injuries depend on several factors: {{the level of the}} fall [5, 6, 8]; the landing position of the body; the surface onto which the victim falls [8, 9]; age; and comorbidities of the patient [8, 9, 10].

50|$|In a study {{conducted}} to examine the types of snowboarding injuries and changes in <b>injury</b> <b>patterns</b> over time, data was collected on injured snowboarders and skiers in a base-lodge clinic of a ski resort in Vermont over 18 seasons (1988-2006) and included extensive information about <b>injury</b> <b>patterns,</b> demographics, and experience. In conclusion of the study, {{the highest rate of}} injury was among young, inexperienced, female snowboarders. Injury rates in snowboarders have fluctuated over time but still remain higher than skiers.

50|$|A tibial plateau {{fracture}} is a {{bone fracture}} or {{break in the}} continuity of the bone occurring in the proximal part of the tibia or shinbone called the tibial plateau; affecting the knee joint, stability and motion. The tibial plateau is a critical weight-bearing area located on the upper extremity of the tibia and is composed of two slightly concave condyles (medial condyle and lateral condyle) separated by an intercondylar eminence and the sloping areas in front and behind it. It can be divided into three areas: the medial tibial plateau (the part of the tibial plateau that is nearer {{to the center of the}} body and contains medial condyle), the lateral plateau (the part of the tibial plateau that is farthest away from the center of the body and contains the lateral condyle) and the central tibial plateau (located between the medial and lateral pleateaus and contains intercondylar eminence). Depending on the <b>injury</b> <b>pattern,</b> lesions may be restricted to the tibia or may have significant soft tissue injury as well as meniscal and ligamentous injuries to the knee. However, a standard tibial plateau fracture involves either cortical interruption, depression or displacement of the articular surfaces of the proximal tibia without significant injury to the capsule or ligaments of the knee.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There {{are several}} studies about M 1 type vehicle-pedestrian {{collision}} <b>injury</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{and based on}} them, there has been several changes in automobiles for pedestrian protection. However, the lack of sufficient studies about <b>injury</b> <b>pattern</b> in motorbikes-pedestrian collisions leads {{to a lack of}} optimization design of these vehicles. The objective of this research is to study the <b>injury</b> <b>pattern</b> of pedestrians involved in collisions with motorized two-wheeled vehicles. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study of pedestrian’s deaths after collisions with motorcycles in an urban area, like Barcelona was performed. The cases were collected from the Forensic Pathology Service database of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Catalonia. The selected cases were categorized as pedestrian-motorcycle collision, between January 1 st 2006 and December 31 th 2014. Data were collected from the autopsy, medical, and police report. The collected information was then analyzed using Microsoft Excel statistical functions. Results: Traumatic Brain Injury is the main cause of death in pedestrian hit by motorized two-wheeled vehicles (62. 85...|$|E

40|$|Rollover crashes {{are one of}} {{the most}} severe crash modes for {{passenger}} vehicle occupants in Australia. They produce a wide range of <b>injury</b> <b>patterns</b> due to their ballistic and chaotic nature. Thus, multiple injury mitigation strategies are required to protect occupants against the large variety of potential loading and impact scenarios. Many strategies (e. g. side curtain airbags and upper interior head protection) have been employed to reduce the occurrence of injuries in rollover crashes with varying success. Recent epidemiological research regarding serious and fatal head, spine, and thoracic injury in pure rollover crashes has identified distinct <b>injury</b> <b>patterns</b> and characteristics. Further, the relationships between these <b>injury</b> <b>patterns</b> and specific occupant, vehicle, and crash factors have also been identified. This work reviews current and proposed injury mitigation techniques specific to pure rollover crashes in light of these recent findings and attempts to identify the types of injuries that each strategy would be most effective at reducing. The injury characteristics previously identified serve as a basis from which to evaluate the estimated effectiveness that particular countermeasures and injury mitigation strategies might have for the Australian passenger vehicle fleet. The findings will provide an up-to-date review with specific focus on Australian rollover characteristics that can be used to inform future regulatory and consumer rating tests...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} severity of initial <b>injury</b> <b>pattern</b> {{and the quality of}} the articular reduction on out-come of displaced intra-articular distal tibial fractures, using a series of 25 patients who were treated with articulated external fixation and limited internal fixation, which provided a spectrum of reduction quality. Out-come was assessed by clinical ankle scores and radio-graphic arthrosis. The results demonstrate the rank or-der method to be a reliable means of stratifying severity of injury and quality of reduction. Neither injury nor re-duction correlated with clinical ankle score. Reduction had a significant correlation with radiographic arthrosis. We conclude that the rank order method is useful in stratification of fracture patients, and that factors other than <b>injury</b> <b>pattern</b> and quality of articular reduction are important in determining outcome of patients with this severe articular injury...|$|E
