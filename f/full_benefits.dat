5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big impact on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> of adopting this new technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{filed an}} appeal with the Ninth Circuit on November 23, but {{made no attempt}} to have the trial court's ruling stayed pending the outcome.

25|$|Before the Caesars jump Knievel {{asked his}} friend Matt Tonning, a Combined Insurance sales agent, {{to sell him}} ten {{accident}} policies. Combined's underwriting policies allowed for {{only one of these}} policies to be written, since the policy covered any accident and was non-cancelable {{for the life of the}} insured. Tonning agreed and was fired by Combined when Knievel filed the claims on all ten. Upon hearing that Tonning had been fired, Knievel contacted Combined's Vice President Matt Walsh. He agreed to return nine of the policies and be paid <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> on only one, if Combined allowed Tonning to return to work. Walsh agreed and Tonning was reinstated.|$|E

25|$|Major legal {{challenges}} to the DADT policy include Witt v. Department of the Air Force and Log Cabin Republicans v. United States. The first ended in a negotiated settlement, but only after the lesbian plaintiff whom the Air Force tried to discharge won retirement with <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> in 2011 as DADT neared its end. In the second, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ordered the military on October 12, 2010, to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that began under DADT. A series of appeals and stays of her ordered followed {{in the fall of}} 2010 just as Congressional attempts to repeal DADT took shape.|$|E
25|$|Founder of Independent Fashion Blogger (IFB), Jennine Jacob, stated how thrilled {{she was to}} get the {{validation}} from high-end {{fashion designers}} (such as Proenza Schouler) that fashion blogging has an incredible impact on the fashion world. Imran Amed stated that there will always be designers and editors that will never fully wrap their head on the huge impact fashion blogging and social media has on the industry, but {{on the other side of}} the spectrum, there are numerous designers, editors, branders and writers that do understand and are “coming on board”. He also states that this is a fairly new phenomenon that will take time for fashion world to reap the <b>full</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{extremely}} slow {{elimination of}} fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine {{from the body}} distinguishes it from other antidepressants. With time, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism, so fluoxetine elimination half-life changes from 1 to 3days, after a single dose, to 4 to 6days, after long-term use. Similarly, the half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16days) after long-term use. Therefore, the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through {{the first few weeks}} of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks. Moreover, the brain concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment. That means that the <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> of the current dose a patient receives are not realized for at least a month since its initiation. For example, in one 6-week study, the median time to achieving consistent response was 29days. Likewise, complete excretion of the drug may take several weeks. During the first week after the treatment discontinuation, the brain concentration of fluoxetine decreases only by 50%, The blood level of norfluoxetine 4 weeks after the treatment discontinuation is about 80% of the level registered {{by the end of the}} first treatment week, and 7 weeks after the discontinuation norfluoxetine is still detectable in the blood.|$|E

40|$|Two-hundred-fifty alcoholics were {{randomly}} assigned to a <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of 50 per cent copayment group before entering an HMO (health maintenance organization) alcoholism treatment program. Data on use of treatment services, use of medical care services, and drinking behavior were collected for one year after intake. The medical care utilization and drinking behavior data were compared to data for the year before intake. The two coverage groups were comparable on sociodemographic characteristics and baseline drinking behavior, but the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> group tended to have higher utilization rates for the year prior to intake and significantly more treatment contracts than those having the 50 per cent copayment requirement. Changes in use of medical care services were similar in both groups. Both payment groups improved, but the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> group tended to be somewhat more improved. Regression analysis supported the relative unimportance of extent of alcoholism coverage in affecting outcome and subsequent medical care utilization...|$|R
25|$|During his presidency, Obama, Congress, and the Supreme Court all {{contributed to}} a huge {{expansion}} of LGBT rights. In 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded hate crime laws to cover crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation. In December 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which ended the military's policy of disallowing openly {{gay and lesbian people}} from openly serving in the United States Armed Forces. Obama also supported the passage of ENDA, which would ban discrimination against employees on the basis of gender or sexual identity for all companies with 15 or more employees, and the similar but more comprehensive Equality Act. Neither bill passed Congress. In May 2012, Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage, shortly after Vice President Joe Biden had also expressed support for the institution. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, and Obama personally congratulated the plaintiff. Obama also issued dozens of executive orders intended to help LGBT Americans, including a 2010 order that extended <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> to same-sex partners of federal employees. A 2014 order prohibited discrimination against employees of federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter ended the ban on women in combat roles, and in 2016, he ended the ban on transgender individuals openly serving in the military. On the international stage, Obama advocated for gay rights, particularly in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Seeking ways {{to evade}} {{deportation}} to the United States, Fischer {{wrote a letter}} to the government of Iceland in early January 2005, requesting Icelandic citizenship. Sympathetic to Fischer's plight, but reluctant to grant him the <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> of citizenship, Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, the Althing (the Icelandic Parliament), at the behest of William Lombardy, agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the U.S. and Japanese governments, and also in recognition of his 1972 match, which had [...] "put Iceland on the map".|$|E
500|$|Thanks to the {{historic}} oil price increases of 2003–2008, OPEC revenues approximated an unprecedented US$1trillion per year in 2008 and 2011–2014. Beyond the OPEC countries, substantial surpluses also accrued to Russia and Norway, and sovereign wealth funds worldwide amassed US$7trillion by 2014–2015. Some oil exporters were unable to reap the <b>full</b> <b>benefits,</b> as the national economies of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela all suffered from multi-year political obstacles associated with what economists call the [...] "resource curse".

500|$|Gold {{initially}} suggested two titles for the magazine, If and Galaxy. [...] Gold's art director, Washington Irving van der Poel, mocked up multiple layouts and Gold invited {{hundreds of}} writers, editors, artists, and fans to view them {{and vote for}} their favorite; the vote was strongly for Galaxy as the title. [...] For the first issue, Gold obtained stories by several well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Theodore Sturgeon, as well as part one of Time Quarry by Clifford D. Simak (later published in book form as Time and Again). [...] Along with an essay by Gold, Galaxys premiere issue introduced a book review column by anthologist Groff Conklin, which ran until 1955, and a Willy Ley science column. Gold sought to implement high-quality printing techniques, although {{the quality of the}} available paper was insufficient for the <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> to be seen.|$|E
500|$|Michael, Pam and Ryan come in {{to discuss}} {{the terms of the}} buyout. After Michael rejects an initial offer of $12,000 to buy the company, David {{suggests}} that he is bluffing, saying he knows that his company's prices are too low to be sustainable. Michael keeps his cool and rebuts that Dunder Mifflin's best branch is [...] "bleeding" [...] and David could be replaced during an upcoming major stockholder meeting as a result. David gives a second offer of $60,000, which is strongly considered, but Michael rejects this offer at the last second and demands the company give him his old job back and hire Ryan and Pam as salespeople. David is reluctant to hire three people with <b>full</b> <b>benefits,</b> especially given Ryan's disastrous history with the company, and likens it to [...] "a multimillion dollar buyout". Michael refuses to back down, and David reluctantly agrees to his demands.|$|E
500|$|Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. {{wrote that}} because the statute equally barred {{both men and women}} from marrying {{partners}} of the same sex, it was not discriminatory on the basis of sex and thus, does not violate the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as plaintiffs argued. Judge Harrell said that the ERA was intended to prohibit sex discrimination against women and did not apply to this case, which he said was a matter of sexual orientation. Judge Lynne A. Battaglia wrote a dissenting opinion stating that the statutes and ordinances in Maryland barring discrimination based on sexual orientation, in addition to the state's lack of prohibiting LGBT adoption and its recognition of same-sex couples as co-parents, support the argument that denying committed same-sex couples the <b>full</b> <b>benefits</b> and privileges of marriage is not related to any rational government interest. Judge Battaglia said she would have remanded the case to circuit court for a full trial in order to settle what she deemed a central factual issue: whether the state could demonstrate that it had [...] "broad societal interest" [...] in retaining marriage in the traditional form. The dissenting opinion from Chief Judge Robert M. Bell faulted the majority for not recognizing gay people as a suspect class in need of protection from discrimination. He dismissed the majority view that gays are politically empowered and should not be viewed as constituting such a class.|$|E
