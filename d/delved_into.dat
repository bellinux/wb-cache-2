5|$|O'Neill {{continued}} working, even at her wealthiest. Perhaps {{driven to}} express herself by the unfortunate circumstances in her life, {{along with the}} needs of her family, she <b>delved</b> <b>into</b> different types of art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O'Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she was elected to the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the Galerie Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively.|$|E
5|$|While {{at school}} during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of {{discipline}} negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college. During the 1960s, he <b>delved</b> <b>into</b> the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, using his painting of an apple for the Apple Records logo. McCartney {{became involved in the}} renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also co-founded International Times, an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years From Now (1997).|$|E
