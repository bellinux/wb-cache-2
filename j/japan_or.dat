5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in <b>Japan,</b> <b>or</b> by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E

5|$|Written {{language}} {{was introduced to}} Japan around 400 AD {{in the form of}} Chinese books written in Classical Chinese. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased {{towards the end of the}} 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, and to bring back books. During circa 300 years in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand. However, Chinese printed editions of the Song Dynasty were imported following an increased trading activity at the start of the Kamakura period (after 1192). The designated manuscripts are either transcriptions of the original works produced in China or in <b>Japan</b> <b>or</b> are Chinese printed editions. The Chinese manuscripts, both handwritten and printed editions, were imported to Japan at the time. The designated treasures are housed in temples, museums, libraries, shrines, universities and in private collections.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of <b>Japan</b> <b>or</b> of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} same field, {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath favored a pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop favored a pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, {{came up with a plan}} to square the circle between Germany having to choose between <b>Japan</b> <b>or</b> China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan together. This was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had much more to offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, the {{men were}} split up and sent to various {{locations}} to serve as forced labourers. The majority of the 2/18th's personnel were sent to Blakang Mati, but some remained in Changi, while others were sent to <b>Japan</b> <b>or</b> were sent {{to work on the}} Thai–Burma Railway. A total of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches, which only about ten percent of the 2/18th men survived. Despite being separated, though, wherever possible the 2/18th men sought to stay together in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity. The battalion's first commanding officer, Varley, was one of those sent to Burma where, as senior Allied officer, he worked to secure the welfare of over 9,000 men working on the railway, including many from the 2/18th. He was later sent to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed. In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa. On 12 September, while en route, the transport ship—Rakuyo Maru—that he and around 1,250 other prisoners were on, was torpedoed by a US submarine, USS Sealion. Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation, attempting to lead them to safety. They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine-gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area.|$|E
