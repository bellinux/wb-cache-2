"The {{solitude}} seems {{intensified by}} the strange sounds of reptiles, [...] birds, and insects, {{and by the}} absence of larger creatures; of which [...] in the day-time, the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd [...] of kangaroo, or the rustle of a wallabi, or a dingo stirring the [...] grass as it creeps to its lair. But there are the whirring of [...] locusts, the demoniac chuckle of the laughing jack-ass, the [...] screeching of cockatoos and parrots, the hissing of the <b>frilled</b> [...] <b>lizard,</b> and the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the [...] dense undergrowth.

5000|$|Chlamydosauromyces is a {{monotypic}} genus, {{which has}} only single {{species in the}} family, Onygenaceae. However, it was initially thought to be affiliated with the family Gymnoascaceae because it possesses ascospores with equatorial grooves, a common feature of the Gymnoascaceae not normally found in the Onygenaceae. [...] hypha As well, hyphae of this species are sparsely differentiated {{similar to those of}} the genus Arachniotus (Gymnoascaceae). Molecular genetic analyses demonstrated the affiliation of this fungus to the Onygenaceae. The genus Chlamydosauromyces was named after the <b>frilled</b> <b>lizard,</b> Chlamydosaurus kingii and the species epithet punctatus was selected in reference to the pitted ornamentation of the ascospores. The name Chlamydosauromyces punctatus is a Latin masculine name.|$|E
50|$|Chlamydosauromyces punctatus {{was first}} {{found in the}} putatively healthy Squamate {{reptiles}} free of cutaneous lesions. The fungus was first isolated in 2001 from the shed skin of a 7-year-old healthy male <b>frilled</b> <b>lizard,</b> Chlamydosaurus kingii, from the San Diego Zoo (the lizard typically lives in trees found {{in the northern part}} of the Australia). Among samples of three different Squamate reptiles donated by the Zoo, the skin samples of two of the reptile species did not show any evidence of invasion by the fungus. The ex-type strain of C. punctatus is in depository at UAMH 9990. Though unique to reptiles, this species is distinct from the commonly associated fungal pathogens of reptiles. C. punctatus is associated with the shed skin of healthy lizards free of lesions or symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The Bearded Dragon (Pogona spp), {{a native}} of Australia, is now found {{worldwide}} as a popular pet.

It {{is a member of}} the family Agamidae – the dragon lizards - a group of lizards found throughout the western Pacific, Australia, Indo-Malaysia, Asia and Africa. Characterized by a lack of autotomy (tail loss), the presence of tubercles and spines on juxtaposed scaled skin and a broad, flat fleshy tongue, this family is represented in Australia by the Bearded Dragon, water dragons, the <b>Frilled</b> <b>Lizard</b> and many other species. Most agamids are terrestrial, although a few are semiarboreal. They are oviparous, usually laying their eggs in shallow burrows...|$|E
