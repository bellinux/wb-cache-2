5|$|A large table tomb at {{the west}} end of the churchyard is listed {{separately}} by English Heritage as a GradeII-listed structure. Dating from about 1800, it contains the remains of George and Mary Hutchinson. The structure is of pale (but heavily weathered) stone, including a two-step plinth, with various inscriptions on the sides, topped with a carved urn decorated with putti. The Grade II listing was <b>given</b> <b>on</b> 23February 1983.|$|E

5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis <b>given</b> <b>on</b> the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been <b>given</b> <b>on</b> exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E
5|$|A video {{album was}} {{released}} {{for the special}} and includes extra footage like a capella performances and photo gallery. The 5.1 surround sound of the release utilized DTS-HD Master Audio and new technology to provide the viewer an optimum experience of watching the live concert. Emphasis was <b>given</b> <b>on</b> the main music and the vocals sung during the concert, while adjusting them against the screaming and the cheering of the crowd. The release was a commercial success, reaching {{the top of the}} DVD charts in the United States, France and Italy and the top-ten in other nations. It received double platinum certifications in Australia and France, while in the United Kingdom, it was certified gold.|$|E
50|$|Monosaccharides have heats of {{combustion}} {{of around}} 3.75 kcal/g (15.7 kJ/g), disaccharides 3.95 kcal/g (16.5 kJ/g) and polysaccharides 4.15 to 4.20 kcal/g (17.4 to 17.6 kJ/g). The heat of hydrolysis {{is very small}} and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis. Thus 100 g sucrose <b>gives</b> <b>on</b> hydrolysis 105.6 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch <b>gives</b> <b>on</b> hydrolysis 110 g glucose.|$|R
60|$|In any case, {{to go on}} with James’s tale, he {{went with}} Ruthven up a {{staircase}} (the great staircase), ‘and through three or four rooms’—‘three or four sundry houses’—‘the Master ever locking behind him every door as he passed, and so into a little study’—the turret. This is perplexing. We nowhere hear in the evidence of more than two doors, in the suite, which were locked. The staircase perhaps <b>gave</b> <b>on</b> the long gallery, with a door between them. The gallery <b>gave</b> <b>on</b> a chamber, which had a door (the door battered by Lennox and Mar), and the chamber <b>gave</b> <b>on</b> a turret, which had a door between it and the chamber.|$|R

5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, was <b>given</b> <b>on</b> 3 March 1942. Using a French {{ship would}} involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|Approval was <b>given</b> <b>on</b> 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of}} the AWACS system. To allow further {{development of the}} aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement <b>given</b> <b>on</b> 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} three years, {{according}} to the calculations of Mahler's friend Guido Adler the Eighth Symphony received a further 20 performances across Europe. These included the Dutch premiere, in Amsterdam under Willem Mengelberg on 12March 1912, and the first Prague performance, <b>given</b> <b>on</b> 20March 1912 under Mahler's former Vienna Hofoper colleague, Alexander von Zemlinsky. Vienna itself {{had to wait until}} 1918 before the symphony was heard there. In the US, Leopold Stokowski persuaded an initially reluctant board of the Philadelphia Orchestra to finance the American premiere, which took place on 2March 1916. The occasion was a great success; the symphony was played several more times in Philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to New York, for a series of equally well-received performances at the Metropolitan Opera House.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{retained}} the {{lead from the}} pole position throughout the beginning lap. On the second lap, Brendan Gaughan collided into the wall, prompting the first caution to be <b>given.</b> <b>On</b> the lap six restart, Edwards remained the leader. On the following lap, Kurt Busch passed Edwards to become the leader. On lap 7, Biffle had fallen two positions as David Reutimann overtook him. Three laps later, Johnson moved up to the 13th position. By the fourteenth lap, Harvick had moved up eight positions {{since the beginning of}} the race. Harvick continued to move forward while Busch maintained the lead. On lap 28, Edwards claimed the first position from Busch. By the 30th lap, Hamlin moved up to fifth on the grid after passing Reutimann. The next lap, Kyle Busch, Kurt's younger brother, hit the wall, but sustained minor damages. On lap 41, Hamlin moved up to third as Edwards maintained a 1.5-second lead. Three laps later, Hamlin passed Kurt Busch to claim second.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to reduced}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{during the period}} after a dive when the residual gas levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness. Rules for safe ascent are based on extension of the decompression model calculations to the desired altitude, but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods {{for a range of}} exposures. For the extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive, the US Navy requires a surface interval of 48 hours before ascent to altitude. A surface interval of 24 hours for a Heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for Heliox no-decompression dive are also specified. More detailed surface interval requirements based on the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the preceding 24‑hour period are <b>given</b> <b>on</b> the US Navy Diving Manual Table 9.6, both for ascents to specified altitudes, and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000ft.|$|E
