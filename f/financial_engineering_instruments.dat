40|$|I {{examine the}} ways in which {{processes}} of financialization articulate with regulatory regimes to affect urban governance by taking up the case of <b>Financial</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Instruments</b> (FEIs) in the European Union's Cohesion Policy. In the `post-crisis' era of European austerity, FEIs `leverage' EU funds with private capital in order to more efficiently and effectively utilize the funds, amplify their impact, and introduce a "more commercial approach to the regeneration of urban areas". The transformation of these funds from grant assistance to `repayable investments' allows for the financing of public-private `urban regeneration' projects, for which investment decisions are based on standards of economic performance and credit worthiness rather than social necessity. I examine the unfolding discourses and logic driving these regulatory instruments, and argue that as the technology for implementing development policy and shaping socio-spatial relations and subjectivities through particular discourse and practice, these financial instruments are a representation of the growing interdependence between (or co-constitution of) neoliberalism and financialization. The transformation of the EU's development policies is contextualized within its broader geographical political economy, and the European financial and economic crises of 2008...|$|E
40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>instruments</b> such as guarantees, {{loans and}} equity are {{increasingly}} used in public funding of enterprises. These instruments have three attractive features: they are repayable, they “leverage” private involvement, {{and they have}} a multiplier effect because they generate new income. At the same time, however, they are technically complex and they are subject to state aid rules. Their assessment under EU state aid rules creates two additional problems. First, under certain conditions financial instruments may not contain state aid. This is when public authorities act as “private investors”. This means that state aid cannot be presumed to exist in all financial instruments. It must first be established through market analysis. Second, when state aid is found to be present it is not always possible to quantify it. For this reason the state aid rules that apply to financial instruments differ significantly from other rules. This paper reviews how financial instruments have been assessed by the European Commission and under which conditions the state aid they may contain can be considered to be compatible with the internal market. The paper finds that by and large Member States have succeeded to design measures that have all been approved by the Commission...|$|E

Version: FinalIn 2010, the Managing Authority (MA) in Malta launched the first <b>Financial</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Instrument</b> (FEI) under Cohesion policy, taking the form of a loan guarantee scheme entitled the JEREMIE First Loss Portfolio Guarantee Product. This addresses a “financing gap” in Malta wherein enterprises, particularly micro and small, face difficulties in obtaining the necessary financing from banks due to their above-average credit risk and lack of collateral. The JEREMIE scheme utilises funds under Operational Programme (OP) I, Priority Axis (PA) 1 entitled “Enhancing Knowledge and Innovation”, and comprises a holding fund of EUR 10 million to be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The current banking structure in Malta makes such forms of FEIs particularly successful. The JEREMIE scheme is currently the only FEI financed through ERDF in Malta. Although this is true, FEIs, financed through local funds, are not new to the Maltese economy. Unlike loan guarantee schemes, however, not all FEIs have proven to be suitable to the local economy. Venture Capital (VC) funds, for instance, are not economically viable for small ventures that are not engaged in cutting edge innovation. The local authorities realize that although FEIs may effectively generate growth potential for SMEs, non-refundable assistance is still necessary given Malta’s economic structure. Prior to EU accession, non-refundable assistance mainly took the form of tax credits which have been highly successful in retaining investment in Malta as well as attracting new investors to operate locally. Upon EU membership, through improved Community funding opportunities, Malta was better able to diversify its portfolio of assistance to industry and began to offer other forms of nonrefundable assistance, mainly grants. These may be more useful in helping businesses that need imminent and short-term assistance, such as start-ups and micro businesses. Since this type of assistance was lacking prior to EU accession, the authorities have focussed more of their resources on non-refundable assistance in the current programming period under OP IN/...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of a severe {{economic}} crisis and austerity, new ideas were put forward to reform cohesion policy to enhance its effectiveness and the return on investment. Among them, <b>financial</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>instruments,</b> such as JESSICA, expected to offer a means to ‘do more with less’ in this difficult budgetary context. In the case of such instruments, EU funds are not offered as grants co-financing investment projects, but rather are used to provide repayable assistance to projects, a form of support. Such revolving funds approach is in stark contrast with the grant-based assistance typically offered as part of EU cohesion policy and was expected to increase the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions. But does it fulfil those expectations? This paper examines JESSICA through the conceptual lens of policy instruments literature. It verifies whether JESSICA is actually fit for its purpose of supporting sustainable urban development. It also gauges the impacts of instrument on the behaviour of the actors involved in its implementation at the sub-national level. The findings indicate that JESSICA is a flawed and overly complex instrument that instead of doing ‘more with less’ only allows for achieving ‘less with less’. However, it still exerts a positive influence on the sub-national authorities involved by promoting cross-sectoral interactions and facilitating learning. It also promotes a change in the approach to EU cohesion policy and public investment more generally, putting more emphasis on economic viability of investment.

40|$|The {{urban renewal}} and {{regeneration}} {{market is not}} homogenous. The widespread presence of urban areas suffering from difficult social and economic conditions {{is one of the}} main challenges that many regions in the European Union face. 1 One of the instruments for supporting investments within urban communities, complementary to public grant funding, are <b>Financial</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Instruments</b> (FEIs 2). A new policy initiative was developed by the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) to facilitate managing authorities’ (MAs) investment in urban development: The Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA or “the Initiative” or “the Action”). This paper aims to support the debate for a stronger deployment of Financial Instruments (FIs 3) in the context of cohesion policy, while also anticipating their implementation to support sustainable urban development. For improved utilisation of FIs in the future, it is essential to capitalise on experience from the 2007 - 13 programming period, which may be relevant for the establishment and effective implementation of FIs promoting the urban agenda in 2014 - 20. This article focuses on the implementation of JESSICA in Italian competitiveness and employment regions, provides an overview of the main difficulties encountered, and presents practical suggestions on howthese bottlenecks can be addressed. Experiences from 2007 - 13 are used as springboard to look ahead, providing recommendations targeting the various stakeholders at the administrative and operation levels (i. e.

40|$|JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) {{program was}} {{implemented}} {{as a part}} of the EU cohesion policy in the framework of 2007 - 2013 programming period. The primary objective of the program was to enhance the financing prospects of SME’s through structural funds that provide <b>financial</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>instruments</b> like loan, guarantee and venture capital. This paper focuses on the effects of JEREMIE on Hungary’s venture capital market. Since 2010, 28 JEREMIE backed venture capital funds were founded in four rounds and 130 billion HUF capital was allocated into these funds with the contribution of Hungarian government. A well-established venture capital market can boost entrepreneurship and innovation, therefore economic growth which is the foundation of government involvement. On the other hand, there is an extensive literature highlighting the limits and possible drawbacks of the active role of public sector in the venture capital market. There is a consensus in the literature that in the long run the extensive role of government in venture capital industry is counterproductive. Substituting market participants by government agencies will hardly result in a competitive and efficient market. However, temporarily as a catalyst public sector can contribute to the development of venture capital market. Direct government intervention supportable temporarily only in the infancy of the industry. The primary objective of every program must be to develop the market to the level where it becomes self-sustaining. This way the success of these programs must not be measured only by the amount of invested capital, financial performance of venture capital funds and venture capital backed companies. Raising private sector awareness and the progress of necessary institutions are also the criteria of a successful program. During the design and implementation of venture capital agendas these aspects must be taken into consideration. This paper aims for evaluating how successful JEREMIE program is in enhancing the development of venture capital industry...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} raise quite {{a number}} of interdisciplinary issues concerning regional economic growth and local development, as well as public finance and sustainability, to mention only a few of them. These issues deserve special attention in our globalized world, given the expectation of a growing impact of climate-related disasters: no surprise that disaster management stands as a new discipline aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice, so as to prevent natural disasters in the first place; afterwards, considerable efforts are required to accelerate business recovery, quickly restore vital energies, and hopefully carry out specific improvement projects as a sort of compensation for the (both personal and economic) losses suffered. Interesting lessons can be learned from natural disasters and can be shared as a payback to those who helped upon their occurrence. Actually, cooperation calls for cross-cultural activities that are likely to benefit from direct experience made by impacted scholars and practitioners: a case in point {{has to do with the}} earthquake that devastated LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aquila and its environs on April 6, 2009 causing more than 300 deaths, apart from extensive damage in the Abruzzo region, in Central Italy; the Abruzzo event Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as this natural disaster is currently referred to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fuels the debate on redevelopment problems to be faced under similar circumstances, that may obliterate the economic environment and attractiveness of an area in a few moments. Due to the huge amount of money needed to undertake appropriate strategies, finance plays a key role and useful insights can be gained by exploring the process of financial innovation. A supporting argument deals with the recourse to micro-finance in order to make the business and economic scenario revive after a natural disaster: micro-credit might be resorted to even within the framework of new <b>financial</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>instruments,</b> such as Urban Development Funds, recently promoted by the European Investment Bank; they include JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises), to be properly considered as strategic tools in sight of redeveloping LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aquila and its surrounding boroughs. ...|$|E

However, under certain conditions, firms {{are required to}} issue more complex <b>financial</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>instruments</b> namely hybrid securities. Literatures showed that very little {{studies have been conducted}} on Islamic Capital Market and in establishing the determinants of hybrid securities. Based on theories of capital structure which related to non hybrid capital structure, the variables and the models on hybrid financing are developed. In further filling the gap of the preceding studies, we developed a dynamic model by incorporating important variables that are associated to macroeconomic indicators that are economic growth (GDP), interest rate (BFR), level of stock market development and bond market development. Several estimation models are developed namely convertible bond plus loan stock which signify for debt treat hybrid (model 1) and warrant which is represent equity treat hybrid (model 2) respectively. This study employs the static model via panel ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects model and random effects model to identify the best estimation model. Besides that, the study also include dynamic model via General Method of Moment (GMM) - first and second generation GMM, to get the most excellent model. From the analysis of static model, it reveals that the best estimation models for both hybrid securities are from model 1 and 2 of fixed effect model. Meanwhile from dynamic analysis, system GMM is considered the most excellent model. As inferences to the body of knowledge, this research has established several factors that are significant in determining hybrid securities for both debt and equity feature hybrid respectively. For Model 1, risk and profitability is considered the most determinant considerations for issuing convertible bond and loan stock in conjunction with its highest coefficient among all the variables under review. Meanwhile for Model 2, financial risk and adverse financial position is the most determinant factors for issuing hybrid equity. These results suggest that, the firms that expose with high risk but low profitable position will opt for warrant for expansion and the firms that have high risk and strong financial position will choose convertible bond or loan stock. Since the high risk firms but profitable are difficult to secure additional credit facility from the financial institutions, there always opt for hybrid security of convertible bond as proposed by risk shifting theory where hybrid securities allow the high risk firm to further venture into riskier business. For high risk but adverse financial position will opt for warrant securities. Meanwhile, the result from model 1 also support the sequential financial problem theory where the hybrid securities enable the profitable firms to venture intopositive NPV project by issuing convertible bond as it offer lower coupon rate as compare to the normal debt rate. These findings can be considered as indication that firms generally use hybrid securities implied by sequential financial problem theory and risk shifting in addition to other capital structure theories such as trade off, pecking order and back door listing...|$|E
