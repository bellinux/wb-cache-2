40|$|In {{recent years}} {{reducing}} the amount of waste generated by households has become an important policy issue in industrialised economies. It is no longer acceptable to discard waste without concern for environmental and natural resource issues. In an effort to reduce household waste various policy instruments such as kerbside charges, <b>deposit‐refund</b> <b>schemes,</b> integrated sales tax exemptions and virgin material taxes, have been proposed and/or implemented. This article reviews the economics literature that has addressed household waste management. It is argued that a comprehensive modelling framework is necessary if the complex policy environment is to be accurately described. Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R

40|$|For decades, {{economists have}} been extolling {{the virtues of}} market-based or economic-incentive {{approaches}} to environmental protection. Some 70 years ago, Arthur Cecil Pigou (1920) suggested corrective taxes to discourage activities that generate externalities. A half century later, J. Dales (1968) showed how the introduction of transferable property rights could work to promote environmental protection at lower aggregate cost than conventional standards. From these two seminal ideas-corrective taxes and transferable property rights-a substantial body of research has developed. Both environmental taxes and marketable permits are {{coming of age in}} the policy arena. Examples include the introduction of marketable permits in the United States to control acid rain, the use of charges in Europe to limit air and water pollution, and the employment of <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>schemes</b> for products ranging from beverage containers to batteries. The introduction of these tools on a large scale provides a unique opportunity to extend the frontiers of knowledge. This essay strives to identify prominent issues that merit investigation...|$|R

It was hoped that MBI, including packaging taxes, effluent taxes and charges, capital or operation subsidies, tradable permits, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>schemes,</b> performance bonds, liability instruments, and many others, would reduce the cost of achieving environmental goals and distribute resources in more efficient ways. The 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development endorsed the use of MBIs as an important component of sustainable development. The principles behind MBI attempt to capture the financial value of environmental services through so-called ‘payments for environmental services’ (PES). Four types of PES schemes can be distinguished and differentiated by the degree of government intervention in administration of the schemes, by characterising the buyers and sellers, and by the source of payments: (1) private payment schemes; (2) cap-and-trade schemes, under a regulatory cap or floor; (3) certification schemes for environmental goods; (4) public payment schemes, including fiscal mechanisms. Over the past decades, a range of payment mechanisms for environmental services have been operating in Latin American, the US and Europ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive up-to-date {{review of the}} literature on the economic instruments that can reduce marine litter. We assess their cost of implementation, level of effectiveness as well as indirect environmental and socio-economic effects (externalities) that may arise {{as a result of their}} implementation. The evidence points to an overall beneficial impact of environmental taxes on items such as plastic bags in terms of reduced use, as well as a corresponding low cost of implementation. In the same vein, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>schemes</b> can achieve high return rates for bottles although at a relatively high cost (especially when the scheme targets a wide range of packaging types). In the case of municipal waste collection, a ‘pay-as-you-throw’ charge can be applied to incentivise waste reduction. In coastal areas, waste collection and treatment can be further supported by the collection of tourist taxes, although there is a high risk that these funds might be used for other purposes. In the fishing industry, rewards for fishing vessels that return waste to shore has been shown to both reduce marine litter as well as complement fishermen's income. Since the vast majority of marine litter comes from land-based sources and consists of plastic, economic instruments that target relevant sources of land-based litter more broadly stand to make the greatest contribution to marine litter reduction. The choice of an appropriate intervention is case specific, largely depending on the tackled source of pollution, the country's institutional characteristics and infrastructure, consumer preferences and habitual behaviour, and the economy's overall sectoral composition...|$|R
40|$|David Pearce's Blueprint for a Green Economy, {{based on}} a report for the then Conservative UK government, {{encouraged}} a major change of government view {{to the effect that}} market-based policies "offer the prospect of a more efficient and flexible response to environmental issues". The policies he refers to include taxes, charges and auctioned permits, which yield revenues that can either be added to other tax revenues, or recycled to reduce distorting taxes and to support environmental good causes. The UK has made advances along these lines, but if these policies are so smart, why are they so difficult to introduce? Among these difficulties is the problem of switching support away from the status quo - a problem that is aggravated by the ease of identifying losers rather than gainers, by inconsistent goals and legislation, by clouded thinking about alternatives and by, whatever the rhetoric, the low political priority afforded to the environment. OECD contributors, Christian Averous and Heino von Meyer, summarise the main conclusions from their OECD Environmental Performance Reviews. Regulatory instruments will need to remain at the core of environmental policies but they need to be supplemented by a range of economic instruments (the list of economic instruments includes charges, taxes, tradable permits, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>schemes,</b> performance bonds and subsidies) and a range of societal instruments (e. g. public consultation and participation, information, and environmental education and training). They find that governments are making efforts to reduce detrimental subsidies but that there remain many examples of users who do not pay for the cost of services that they receive and who thus overuse a resource that is under strain. They note that the public and industry tend to claim that they favour the principle of charging polluters but in practice {{more needs to be done}} to increase their sensitivity to and acceptance of the fact that they should bear the costs of the environmental goods and services they use. ESRI contributors, John FitzGerald, Daniel McCoy and Jonathan Hore consider the magnitude of the challenge posed by Irelands Kyoto target for greenhouse gas emissions. It seems likely that on unchanged policies Ireland's emissions could be up to 25 per cent above their 1990 level by the end of this decade, which is well above the required 13 per cent. They conclude that participation in an international emissions trading programme would be an efficient means of reducing Ireland's emissions and that, to be manageable, such a scheme should only apply to importers or producers of primary energy. To be distributionally fair it is important that the tradable permits be sold rather than given away. The revenue can then be used to reduce distorting taxes and to ensure that poor households are protected against the price rises, which would be similar to those under a policy of carbon taxes. In addition special provision can be afforded to sectors that, owing to their energy intensity, face competitive difficulties. Susan Scott and John Eakins of ESRI, note the widespread view that environmental taxes would simply be additional taxes, a view that ignores the potential for re-spending the revenues. Similarly, people fail to make the link between raised charges for environmental services and reduced central government taxes indeed government forgets to point out that the "double taxation" claim is invalid. That said, as the ESRI has been saying, market-based policies can hurt the poor if part of the re-spent revenues is not targeted at vulnerable households. Re-spending from three examples is investigated, namely, (1) carbon taxes, (2) charges for domestic refuse and (3) water charges, all based on the quantity of pollution or resource use. Various re-spending options are described and it is seen how re-spending could be targeted at low-income households in such a way that, if so wished, they are better off than before. On the issue of consulting people, interesting results emerge Frank Convery asks what factors and associated indicators explain the mobilisation or otherwise of environmental taxation as a substantial policy instrument. Some of the possible factors are: lack of champions in government departments to provide leadership, and lack of economists in public administration. Environmental effectiveness might also be questioned and considered not to be worth the effort, despite evidence to support the effectiveness of some taxes and charges, especially when there are close substitutes to what is being taxed. Concerns about competitiveness, populist culture against charges and uncertainty that government can be relied on to re-spend the revenues are also possible factors. In addition, availability of investment funds from the EU could paradoxically substitute for policies that would temper resource and environmental use. Irish circumstances do seem largely to conform to the factors that could inhibit the use of market forces to support environmental policy, at present. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} various instruments available for implementing waste policy, {{in order to determine}} the most suitable set of policy instruments for achieving solid waste policy objectives in New Zealand. The thesis will also examine the Government's current waste policy before proceeding with the evaluation of the implementation instruments. "Waste" and related terms have not been adequately defined in New Zealand policy or legislation making it difficult to define the boundaries of the issue. Definitions of "waste" and "solid waste" are therefore proposed. The Government's waste policy is critiqued and amended to provide a policy basis for this thesis and a suggested policy for the Government to adopt. The current policy is considered to be lacking in that it does not clearly set out intended goals and objectives. A new objective is proposed of ensuring that policy and action is focused on areas of highest risk and/or impact through the collection of reliable data on all types of waste. Data on various waste streams are currently sorely lacking. As a result, the Government's waste policy has focused on domestic waste and packaging, as two areas with the highest profile and most reliable data, without determining whether this is the most appropriate action to take. Aspects of the waste policy framework are reviewed, namely: current legislation, development of the current waste policy and the current policy work carried out by the Ministry for the Environment. It is found that the focus of waste policy in the 1970 s moved from addressing issues of packaging and limited landfill space, to considering waste as a misplaced resource in the mid- 1980 s. The change in focus was largely due to the economic climate although it coincided with moves to collect data about waste streams, raising awareness of waste streams which had previously been largely ignored. The Resource Management Act 1991 again altered the focus of waste policy with the emphasis on the "effects" of activities. The risk and/or impact of materials on the environment is now particularly relevant, highlighting the need for adequate information regarding these effects. Although base-line data is necessary, a warning is given to the Ministry for the Environment that this should not lead policy back to "end-of-pipe" solutions. This approach would be inappropriate given the approach of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the inclusion of the waste hierarchy in the Government's waste policy. Each party's perception of their role and responsibility and the roles of the other parties in waste policy decisions were determined by conducting interviews with members of industry and central and local government, and by holding three discussion groups with members of the public of differing ages. From these discussions a national postal survey of householders was undertaken. The survey aimed to identify attitudes and behaviour relating to packaging and resulting waste in New Zealand. Packaging and packaging waste were chosen as the topics of the discussion groups and subsequent survey owing to the amount of resources that has been directed by Government at this segment of the waste stream and the perception that packaging is considered by the public to cause one of the biggest problems in the waste stream. This thesis primarily studies instruments to implement waste policy objectives as it is considered that this aspect is currently not being adequately addressed by the Government's waste policy, the decision-making environment and by the parties involved in waste policy decisions. Implementation instruments for waste policy fall broadly into four groups: Regulation, Economic Instruments, Voluntary Initiatives, and Education and Information. Those instruments that are used most often around the world arc critiqued and their potential application to New Zealand is evaluated. The instruments examined in detail are subsidies, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>schemes,</b> product charges, user charges, purchasing policies, waste reduction targets, environmental labelling schemes and cleaner production programmes. A number of other instruments are reviewed in less detail. The evaluation of specific instruments' potential application to New Zealand is carried out against the steps of the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, the hierarchy being: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Residual Management, as this is an accepted objective of the waste policy. This evaluation enables a review of the actions currently being undertaken by central and local government, industry and the public in this area. Instruments which have the potential to most greatly affect the level of achievement of waste policy in New Zealand are considered to include: i) Regulation clarifying the desired outcomes, objectives and implementation instruments of the waste policy; ii) Regulation defining more of the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in waste policy decisions; iii) Existing subsidies directed towards cleaner production programmes and 'Waste Analysis Protocol' 1 Ministry for the Environment, Waste Analysis Protocol. Wellington: Ministry for the Environment, December 1992. landfill surveys; iv) User charges for all waste collection, treatment and disposal services; v) Negotiated targets with industry sectors to reduce the amount of waste produced and disposed of; vi) Education and information to ensure that the philosophy of the waste hierarchy is practiced by individuals and organisations. Using a range of instruments covered in this thesis to implement the waste hierarchy will result in a significant move towards the achievement of the accepted goal of the waste policy, that of maximising net benefits to New Zealand...|$|R
