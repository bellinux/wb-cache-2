40|$|SBML is an XML-based {{format for}} storing and {{communicating}} computational models of biological processes. SBML Level 3 packages are optional modular extensions {{to the core}} of SBML to add constructs that support additional features. The specification documents for SBML Level 3 packages define the syntax and semantics of individual SBML Level 3 packages. The SBMLPkgSpec class for LaTeX provides a standard format for SBML Level 3 package specification documents. It provides a uniform look-and-feel to the family of SBML Level 3 documents, and provides guidance to specification authors about the information that should be included in each specification. Release 1. 7 only marks the move of SBMLPkgClass to a separate GitHub repository, away from its original location as a subdirectory in the general SBML project area on SourceForge. There are no code or LaTeX differences compared to version 1. 6. Apart from some <b>file</b> <b>cleanup</b> and the addition of a README. md file, the only other difference is that the file LICENSE. txt has been updated. (The changes to LICENSE. txt do not alter licensing or distribution terms. ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{are made to}} various other system tools and accessories in Windows 98. Microsoft Backup supports differential backup and SCSI tape devices in Windows 98. Disk Cleanup, a new tool, enables users to clear their disks of unnecessary <b>files.</b> <b>Cleanup</b> locations are extensible through Disk Cleanup handlers. Disk Cleanup can be automated for regular silent cleanups.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} basic {{procedures}} that every copyeditor must follow: copyeditors need {{a system for}} marking changes to the author's text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator (querying), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author's review of the copyediting into a final manuscript or electronic <b>files</b> (<b>cleanup).</b> These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted to exist in a digital on-screen space.|$|R
5000|$|Norton Commander {{is little}} changed from {{previous}} versions, and includes file compression/de-compression of various formats, network utilities access, disk <b>cleanup,</b> <b>files</b> and folder compare, FTP connection management, and more.|$|R
50|$|The jobs {{submitted}} to GRAM are targeted {{at a single}} computation resource, and consist of an optional input file staging phase, job execution, and an optional output <b>file</b> staging and <b>cleanup</b> stage.|$|R
50|$|The tribe has {{proceeded}} to <b>file</b> lawsuits requiring <b>cleanup</b> against mining companies for contamination of waters and land. State and federal politicians {{have moved to}} limit the damages that could be collected against the companies.|$|R
5000|$|System Configuration Utility {{allows users}} to {{manually}} extract and restore individual system files from the Windows ME setup files. It has also been updated with three new tabs called [...] "Static VxDs", [...] "Environment" [...] and [...] "International". The Static VxDs tab {{allows users to}} enable or disable static virtual device drivers to be loaded at startup, the Environment tab allows users to enable or disable environment variables, and the International tab allows users to set international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set via the real mode MS-DOS configuration <b>files.</b> A <b>Cleanup</b> button on the Startup tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries.|$|R
50|$|Other spills and {{releases}} {{occurred over the}} decades of operation as well. In 1989, a DOE investigation found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination on the property. Widely publicized in the local press, the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials, resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site, and the <b>filing</b> of lawsuits. <b>Cleanup</b> commenced, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was brought in {{at the request of}} local legislators to provide oversight.|$|R
40|$|Release_ 2017. 03. 1 (Changes {{relative}} to Release_ 2016. 09. 1) Important The fix for bug # 879 changes {{the definition of}} the layered fingerprint. This means that all database columns using layered fingerprints as well as all substructure search indices should be rebuilt. All C++ library names now start with RDKit (see # 1349).
