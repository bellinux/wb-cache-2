5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans).

Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

25|$|From {{the floor}} of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits {{the man in charge of}} the whole theatre; he is {{surrounded}} by several assistants and messengers. One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand.|$|E

500|$|I love Brett because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little}} bit more naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15.

5000|$|Several {{band members}} and {{employees}} {{felt that he}} did not fit in with the Dead ethos despite his longstanding friendships with Lesh and Garcia; for example, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Church of Scientology throughout his tenure with the band and thus declined to become re-involved with LSD and other drugs. According to band manager Rock Scully, [...] "He was sooo different. You know, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a crew cut. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a marine in a prison camp full of Japanese. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> our boss in a way.

500|$|C.T. Smith is {{introduced}} in the third chapter of Zombiepowder. as an apparent antagonist, a hired assassin working for the Ash Daughters gang. This is, however, a disguise, and Smith is actually Gamma's long-standing partner in powder hunting. Smith is the least developed member of the main cast, with little known backstory or motivation. It is implied that <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> Gamma, a legendarily dangerous criminal. Smith possesses superhuman speed and dexterity, is above-average at everything, and fights using handguns and an armored briefcase. He has no other known abilities, {{but according to the}} duo, Gamma and Smith are each incapable of killing the other. Tite Kubo's character commentary for Smith in volume one states that Smith's appearance was based on a London banker, and notes that the [...] "C.T" [...] in his name was eventually meant to hold some plot significance.|$|E
500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> that? He told me. The pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E
500|$|Maximilien Aue is {{a former}} officer of the SD, {{security}} and intelligence service of the SS; the book is written {{in the form of}} his memoirs. His mother was French (from Alsace), while his father, who left his mother and disappeared from their life in 1921, was German.

He speaks many languages fluently – German, French, Ancient Greek and Latin – and holds a doctorate in law. Despite his French heritage and upbringing, <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> his father, an ardent German nationalist. Even after the war, he is unrepentant of the crimes he committed in the name of National Socialism, [...] "believing that it was my duty and {{that it had to be}} done, disagreeable or unpleasant as it may have been." [...] He is extremely attracted to his twin sister Una, which led to an incestuous relationship with her when they were children, but ended when they entered puberty. Refusing to truly love any woman other than Una, he becomes a homosexual but continues to fantasize about having sex with Una.|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders.

[...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones.

[...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E
