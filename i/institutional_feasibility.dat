Documents and photos, which trace the path followed by the one called the Mother of the Poor and the Good Angel of Bahia, are filed in the nucleus. Sister Dulce's Memorial houses approximately three thousand testimonies of the graces that were obtained. The investment in its perpetuation has as its pillar the Sister's canonization process, which started in January 2000 {{with the aim of}} having the Catholic Church acknowledge the virtues and the tireless determination of one of God's Servants who dedicated her life to the needy. Presently, the process, whose postulator is an Italian Friar, Paolo Lombardo, is following the procedural steps from the Congregation to the Cause of Saints in the Vatican. With the presentation of the Positio, a canonic law text that summarizes the process and the history of the virtues and the possible miracle already identified by the Vatican, the beatification is getting closer. As part of the work in favor of this cause, OSID has invested in the dissemination of Sister Dulce's life, launching a book of thoughts and her biography, as well as the construction of the Church of Our Lady of the Conception of God's mother. As a symbol of Sister Dulce's legacy of action and faith, the church building complies with the Vatican's recommendation as reinforcement to the beatification process and gives more <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> to OSID.|$|E

40|$|<b>Institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> {{defined as}} the ability of {{institutions}} to support adaptive capacity, is {{an important aspect of}} climate adaptation, through its influence on the implementation of adaptation measures to climate change. The objective {{of this study is to}} create a framework for assessing institutional preconditions that enable or constrain climate change adaptation measures in agriculture and to apply the framework to a case study in agriculture. We adopted and modified the Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment (PICA). Institutions in our framework are characterized by a set of crucial institutional preconditions (CIPs) and indicators linked to each CIP. CIPs refer to both institutional incentives and constraints for implementation of adaptation measures (here to climate change). We applied a combination of ranking and scoring techniques based on information from workshops, interviews and a literature review to assess institutional incentives and constraints for adaptation measures, together indicating the <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> of implementation of adaptation measures. We selected and assessed three adaptation measures relevant to agriculture in Flevoland, a province in the Netherlands: (1) improvement of water management and irrigation facilities; (2) relocation of farms; and (3) development of new crop varieties. The two main constraining CIPs for the implementation of the measures were found to be (1) heterogeneity of actors’ interests and (2) availability of resources. Based on the <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> analysis, the implementation of water management and improvement of irrigation facilities will potentially face fewer institutional constraints compared to the other two measures. We conclude that our approach proves applicable for institutional analyses of adaptation measures for current and future (climate) challenges at different levels of implementation, but that more applications are needed to test its validity and robustness...|$|E

40|$|The {{progressive}} attempt {{and implementation}} of direct payment limitations since the 1992 CAP reform has developed a “modulation mechanism” aiming to transfer funds from market support and direct payment schemes (CAP first pillar) towards rural development measures (CAP second pillar). Under the 2007 - 2013 European financial perspectives, the annual 5 % rate of modulation is expected to increase. The paper focuses on the financial impacts of four scenarios together with corresponding political and <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibilities.</b> The paper imposes on itself three sound constraints: (i) expanding modulation should not jeopardise the future in-depth reform of the direct payment regime, (ii) modulation should be compulsory and consistent with rural development financial needs, and (iii) present direct payment per farm should not be capped or subject to complex and differentiated reduction rates. Then, the paper suggests adopting a dynamic and uniform modulation rate to be increased by 1 percent per year from 2009 and then by 2 percent during the final step reaching 10 percent in 2012 (2013 financial year). It would deliver certainty to farmers and contribute to an efficient use in European spending, with {{no need for a}} controversial equity instrument. Direct payment reductions raise subsidiarity and budgetary issues which should be discussed within the European budget review. Considering the modulation mechanism as a related past-policy tool, renewed European decision making process and actors should outline from 2009 a new paradigm in direct payment regime. Since farmers are increasingly becoming entrepreneurs, the sooner an agreement on the CAP beyond 2013 is reached, the better. direct payments, rural development, European budget, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

Economists tout policies based on market-based economic incentives as the most cost-effective methods for addressing {{a wide variety of}} environmental problems. This chapter examines market-based incentives and their applicability to Latin America. We first review the market-based incentives traditionally used to address pollution – emissions taxes, environmental subsidies, tax and subsidy combinations, tradable pollution permits, and hybrid instruments – and compare these instruments to command-and-control policies. We then discuss two sets of factors that affect how feasible and efficient pollution control policy will be in Latin America. We focus on practical considerations such as monitoring and enforcement, distributional issues, political <b>feasibility,</b> <b>institutional</b> considerations, administrative costs, and compliance costs. We also examine what the violation of standard modeling assumptions implies for the success of pollution control policy. In particular, we focus on non-competitive market structures, imperfect information or uncertainty, the effects of regulation on global competitiveness, and the compatibility of environmental goals with the goals of growth and development. Finally, we compare Latin American experiences with market-based incentives with those in the U.

The major features of this air traffic management (ATM) concept concern the delegation of the separation task from the air traffic controllers to the flight crew for a defined part of the airspace. A major prerequisite of the full-scale implementation of the self-separation concept is the examination of its <b>institutional</b> and economic <b>feasibility.</b> This study provides the methodological steps for identification of possible legal and institutional barriers and enablers to the introduction of such a concept as well as an analysis of the concept's economic viability. The expected outcome of the institutional analysis is the determination of the changes in the existing institutional framework that may facilitate introduction of the new concept. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is applied for the economic appraisal of ATM changes proposed in the concept. Given that the self-separation {{concept of operations}} is in its definition phase, scarcity of cost and benefit data is encountered. A methodological framework is proposed for applying the CBA for this type of ATM operational concept. Applying the institutional analysis for Europe indicated that changes in the relevant regulatory framework should be in place to deploy the proposed concept.

40|$|The Sustainable City {{study of}} the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) uses an analytical-deliberative {{approach}} to generate integrated options for strategic, long-term urban development policies in the Netherlands. Scenarios for the sustainable city were designed using visions and roadmaps that were actively developed by actors involved in urban development and planning. The subsequent scenario analysis on potential, coherence and distributional effects across socio-economic groups was combined with the narratives from the stakeholder dialogues to develop model-based narratives. These model-based narratives indicate the necessity of extensive national and international policy choices {{in the fields of}} energy, transport and spatial planning for the ecological sustainability of cities. The local level emerges as crucial when it comes to social sustainability.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} developing agri-environmental policy measures in Israel, focusing on market-oriented instruments. A conceptual framework for developing agri-environmental policy measures is presented, first in very broad lines (mandatory regulations, economic instruments and advisory measures) and subsequently focusing on economic instruments, and specifically, on market-oriented ones. Two criteria of choice between the measures are suggested: their contribution to improving {{the effectiveness of the}} policy; and the feasibility of their implementation. This is the framework used for analyzing agri-environmental measures in Israel. Israel currently implements a mix of mandatory regulations, economic instruments and advisory measures to promote the agri-environment. The use of additional economic instruments may improve the effectiveness of the policy. When comparing the effectiveness of various economic measures, we found that the feasibility of implementation of market-oriented instruments is greater, due to the Israeli public’s preference for strengthening market orientation in the agricultural sector.

We found that in this case study, the <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> and acceptance by stakeholders were the major parameters influencing the implementation of the market-oriented instruments, whereas the instruments’ contribution to enhancing the ecological o...|$|E

With the same method, Verbruggen and Lauber (2012) evaluated the feed-in tariff and TGC system in three criteria of efficiency, equity and <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility.</b> Some of the researchers analyzed the TGC system by using the system dynamic method. In recent researches, this method has been used for conceptualizing, analyzing, designing and evaluating issues in energy sectors such as energy policy, power pricing, strategies of electricity market, and interaction between electricity and TGC markets (Ahmad and bin Mat Tahar 2014). Ford et al. (2007) predicted the price of certificates to aid green electricity from the wind resources. The results showed that after a few years the wind power exceeds the requirements because in the early years when a market opens the price of TGC will be increased rapidly. Recently, Hasani-Marzooni and Hosseini (2012) modeled the TGC system by employing the system dynamics to identify the potential investment in the wind energy. They showed that the system dynamics can be used as an appropriate tool to investigate TGC market and help the regulatory authorities to choose the appropriate policies in the energy sector.|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} much-debated {{question}} of what legal form the 2015 climate agreement is supposed to have, another core issue is the substantive content of countries' commitments.

The paper proposes a fiscal stimulus consistent with those institutions and constrains. In very few countries do there exist the institutions for the implementation of monetary policy. About one third of the countries are members of regional common currency institutions that eliminate the exchange rate and national monetary policy as policy tools.

40|$|In the {{discussion}} that follows, Section I begins by exploring {{the genesis of}} linkage. Although its relative emphasis may be a recent development, linkage is not itself a new phenomenon, but a long-contemplated topic {{in the history of}} international trade. Section II surveys and categorizes the contemporary linkage debate from three aspects: motivation (why to link), desirability (whether to link), and issue areas (what to link). It then critiques the existing literature, arguing that representative works are either too hypothetical, unempirical, or narrowly focused on particular regulatory topics. Against the backdrop of this critique, Section III shifts the focus of the linkage debate to the tension between free trade and social regulation. Based on the view that this tension could, if left unaddressed, ultimately lead to an entropic disaster of either trade failure or regulatory failure, Section IV proposes a synergistic understanding of competing values that emphasizes, and is consistent with, the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s integrationist telos. Based on this synergistic vision, and within the bounds of <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility,</b> Section IV explores a multifaceted list of options, the implications of which extend well beyond the narrow terrain of WTO activities.

Among the most pressing of these ethical and legal dilemmas {{is the matter of}} whether the use of force can be justified for humanitarian purposes, or for the protection of human rights. Although a wealth of theorists have taken aim at this issue, it is the contention of this thesis that only the 'ontology of becoming' (an idea which is traced through all branches of constructivist theorising) boasts the conceptual and analytical force to successfully and thoroughly appraise the relationship between humanitarian intervention and international justice. In developing this claim, this thesis seeks to hybridise constructivism with a number of other theories which employ the arguments associated with the ontology of becoming, including: cosmopolitanism, communitarianism, solidarism and feminism. The purpose of this process is to demonstrate the ways in which this branch of international relations theory can both enrich, and be enriched by an account of what might {{be thought of as a}} 'constructed duty of justice'. Ultimately, this thesis asserts that adherence to the requirement of <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> dictated by the ontology of becoming necessarily limits the agenda for the reform of international society. However, those normative developments which can withstand the restrictions brought to bear by the consensual nature of international politics do provide the means for international society to advance, albeit incrementally and inconsistently, toward an increasingly prominent role for considerations of justice...|$|E

Yet in China and India policy development has been very erratic.   This paper takes a case study approach to examine solar energy policies, particularly solar energy auctions, in China and India.   Thus, this thesis aims to examine solar energy policy in China and India, and compare the potential of each country for energy security and sustainable development under the IRENA framework to Evaluate Renewable Energy Policy.   The performance of solar energy policy in China and India is assessed on criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility.</b>   This study find that China has installed more cumulative solar capacity than India and that overall that solar energy policy in China is stronger than in India.   However, at an individual policy level, India’s solar energy auction policy is stronger than China’s.   Thus, the long-term sustainability of solar energy policy and deployment in both countries is a complex and multifaceted issue.   This thesis concludes that for energy security and sustainable development the continuation of policy support is necessary in both countries to ensure that solar will continue to grow in significance...|$|E
40|$|Well-targeted {{programs}} of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water can help overcome {{the problem of}} both floods and droughts, or in other terms meet the water demands for domestic as well as irrigation needs during the dry season. Addressing this, a novel form of conjunctive use management has been developed that involves strategically recharging floodwater in upstream areas to boost small-scale groundwater irrigation and to protect floodaffected areas downstream. For this, choice of site is a crucial component to implement the approach. A method was devised using GIS tools using readily available data from secondary sources {{to arrive at a}} suitability index to rank prospects across the entire Ganges basin. This basin was chosen because it has a well-known history of devastating flooding events and water shortage in dry months {{and is one of the}} largest and most heavily populated river basins in the world. Numerical modelling is being applied to an area characterized as having high prospects to help to understand the interactions between the groundwater and surface water and the impact of floods on groundwater system. One of the main components to be identified from the model is the peak flows to be captured successfully for recharge. This utilisation of high flows by diverting from the rivers to storage structures introduced within the model will help to identify the potential to manage and reduce the flood impact. This model can help to decide on the size and placement of the structures to store water for maximum recharge and subsequently in watershed management. The relationship between floodwater storage and recharge, and the optimisation of these two processes can also be brought out.

40|$|The {{public debate}} on food {{reserves}} is shifting from an ideological discussion about markets versus public action to one {{focusing on the}} technical, political and <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> {{of a system of}} food reserves. Food reserves can be an important tool to achieve more stable food supplies and prices for consumers, and more resilient and equitable markets for producers—escpecially given the diversity in food and agriculture systems and financial resources both nationally and locally. Governments are again waking up to this fact. Action is needed to move beyond public rhetoric to effective actions on food reserves. Possible steps include holding governments accountable to their commitments to reduce hunger and invest in agriculture; fostering discourse with civil society and social movements on their experiences to learn best practice; and developing criteria for the successful implementation of food reserves. Hold governments accountable During the High-level Conference on World Food Security in 2008, then again in 2009 at the G- 8 Summit in L’Aquila, Italy and at the World Food Summit in Rome, governments recognized the potential of food reserves to deal with humanitarian food emergencies and to limit price volatility. In fact, they called for a review of this issue as part of coordinated response to the global food crisis. Unfortunately, this review has not yet happened. As a first step toward realizing the potential of food reserves, IATP and others have called on governments to honor their commitment for a comprehensive review of food reserves, incorporating lessons learned and identifying potential models, as well as allocating appropriate resources and setting a firm deadline for varying levels of implementation by the end of 2010. 1 Dozens of farm, faith, development and other citizens ’ organizations from around the world joined IATP to call on governments to: 1.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a simple}} methodological tool {{for supporting the}} participatory elaboration of future urban scenarios through successive approximations. It systematizes one possible way to build answers {{to a set of}} critical questions when attempting to compose strategic urban programs. To this end, we focused on devising a simple sequence of understandable, easy-to-apply Multi Criteria Evaluation instruments which - by means of ‘light’ ‘accounting’ calculation procedures - may “help (planners) to think” (Calcagno, 1972). The deliberate simplicity of this approach - an ‘intelligent’, transparent and intentional management of elements of analytical and intervention fields, funded on their exhaustive qualitative descriptions and on explicit statements of interests and purposes - prioritises the political side of decision – making. Thus, the paper also seeks to contribute to the reflection on the roles and views of social actors when defining and constructing urban public scenarios. First, we discuss the conceptual and political contents and implications of Diagnoses and Scenario- building, in which involved actors (i) elaborate causal interpretations of urban processes, (ii) specify and select strategic trajectories and (iii) compose and structure project portfolios, by (eventually) supporting them through progressive agreements and consensus. Next, we propose a methodological approach to assessing <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> and political viability of given strategic trajectories. Finally, we discuss some contextual and operational conditions of these analyses. On the technical side, this framework is originally focused on the interactions among Land Use, Mobility and Energy consumption patterns, three strong determinants of the socio-spatial structuring of territories which - both in Argentina and other Latin American countries - are seldom addressed through transversal, integrated planning approaches. Quite on the contrary, public urban management models – referred to those as well as to other relevant drivers of urban structuring - are most often characterized by remarkable jurisdictional and institutional disarticulation, high technical and thematic fragmentation, ritual emphases on bureaucratic processes rather than on factual objectives or results. Accordingly, formulation and evaluation of public urban policies usually present extremely low levels of systemic completeness. It is suggested that - in these types of highly fragmented governance environments - this approach may contribute to making experts’ and social actors’ views explicit and to enabling transversal thinking. The analysis of diverse structuring, feasibility and viability assessments may – if applied through successive approximations - help planners to reconfigure the strategic composition of public policies, whether by (i) modifying the strategy portfolio, (ii) modifying the sequence of strategies or (iii) incorporating new strategies in order to modify the balance between involved actors’ rejections and supports, while maintaining the meanings, orientations and aims of the evaluated policy...|$|E

As populations grow and urban centres expand, meeting water demand and wastewater management requirements will become increasingly difficult. Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals is to: ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’. Part of the approach to achieving this will be reusing wastewater and will require {{a greater understanding of}} the institutional arrangements that support or obstruct reuse. This research was designed to achieve this and aimed to develop a set of factors that investors could use to assess the <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> of reuse in a given setting. The methodology combined a case study approach, focusing on wastewater systems in Bangalore, India and Hanoi, Vietnam, with triangle analysis to assess: the content of policies and laws; the structures (formal and informal) to implement laws and reuse projects; and the culture around acceptance and engagement in reuse. The reuse practices observed in Bangalore were treatment and use within apartments, centralized treatment and sale to industries, use in agriculture after natural attenuation, groundwater recharge and lake regeneration. In Hanoi the only reuse was indirect use from rivers feeding fish ponds and fields, although formal treatment and use is planned. Critically, both cities have environmental and water resources policies and laws that advocate reuse, as well as related local legislation. However, support for reuse is not reciprocated in industrial, agricultural or fisheries law, the result being that reuse does not always take place as planned. Legislation is required along the whole sanitation chain to the point of wastewater use. Structures to implement reuse are also vital. In Bangalore the water board has initiated reuse projects and established the New Initiatives Division but resources are a limiting factor. Effective institutions include expertise, manpower and financing mechanisms, which are lacking in both cities. The environment agency is also engaged in reuse though legislation on recycling in residential and commercial complexes but guidance for users is inadequate, expectations are perceived to be excessive and monitoring is almost impossible. The driver for reuse is increasingly the benefits observed by users. In the case of apartments this is a reliable water source and reduced costs of water supply. As a result, a private sector in wastewater treatment is becoming established. The active civil society and strong, independent media are instrumental in providing information to potential users and holding authorities to account in Bangalore. Their absence in Hanoi is notable. In summary, institutional elements to be considered are: supportive legislation across all sectors; details of acceptable reuse, deterrents and inducements; budget allocation; structures to enable reuse; strong civil society, NGOs, courts, media and universities providing evidence of suitability and safety; donors and finance mechanisms; and stakeholders willing to use the products. Encumbrances are inconsistent or uncoordinated legislation, lack of cooperation and insufficient benefit sharing or perceptions of benefits along the reuse chain...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to make a {{contribution}} to the ongoing debate on integrated development planning as a new and challenging task for furthering development-oriented local government in South Africa. An arrangement had been made between the German Development Institute, the South African Department of Constitutional Development, the Provincial Government of Mpumalanga and the German Agency for Technical Co-operation, GTZ. The aim was to provide a study which gives more insight into the complex field of making participatory development planning {{an integral part of the}} new decentralised system of government. Jointly formulated terms of reference and empirical research in two municipalities of the province of Mpumalanga are used to present some first findings. They throw some light on the difficulties and possibilities of the ongoing reform and transformation process towards more participatory and integrated planning with the aim of broad-based socio-economic development. The research as such and the stay in Pretoria and the Mpumalanga area was generously supported by representatives of the South African government and non-governmental organisations involved. The counterparts of the GDI-study group were Mr. Brian Marrian from the national Department of Constitutional Development (DCD) in Pretoria and Mr. Bruno Vilane from the provincial Department for Local Government, Housing and Land Administration in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. Mr. Marrian is also manager of the GTZ-supported Decentralised Development Planning Programme (DDP). Both counterparts as well as the representatives of GTZ, Dr. Theo Rauch and Mrs. Ute Klamert from the Provincial Administration Programme (PAP), expressed great interest in the study in that the empirical research on the local level can lead to answers as to the political and <b>institutional</b> <b>feasibility</b> of the new planning approach. All of them have helped to determine and clarify the terms of reference, the focus and the structure of the study. During their two-week preparatory visit to Berlin, the counterparts participated in a visiting programme focusing on the German federal system of local self-governance (kommunale Selbstverwaltung) and local business promotion of the Land Brandenburg.

Darin geht es um partizipatorische Entwicklungsplanung als integraler Bestandteil des neuen dezentralisierten Regierungssystems in Suedafrika. Ein gemeinsamer Bezugsrahmen fuer die Transformation Suedafrikas wird formuliert. In einer empirischen Untersuchung werden ueber siebzig Interviews mit Vertretern verschiedener Institutionen und auf verschiedenen Verwaltungsebenen gefuehrt. Dabei wird von der Hypothese ausgegangen, dass integrierte Entwicklungsplanung die Vorbedingungen fuer kommunale soziale und oekonomische Entwicklung verbessert. In zwei Provinzverwaltungen von Mpumalanga werden die Schwierigkeiten und Moeglichkeiten der anhaltenden Reform und des Transformationsprozesses auf dem Weg zu einer breitangelegten soziooekonomischen Entwicklung aufgezeigt. Im Mittelpunkt steht die Verknuepfung der kommunalen oekonomischen Entwicklung mit dem integrierten Entwicklungsplan, unter den realen Bedingungen der Kommunalverwaltung.
