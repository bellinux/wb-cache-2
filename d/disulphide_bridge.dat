25|$|Proteins {{are held}} in their {{tertiary}} structure by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). Epistatic interactions occur whenever one mutation alters the local environment of another residue (either by directly contacting it, or by inducing changes in the protein structure). For example, in a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge,</b> a single cysteine {{has no effect on}} protein stability until a second is present at the correct location at which point the two cysteines form a chemical bond which enhances the stability of the protein. This would be observed as positive epistasis where the double-cysteine variant had a much higher stability than either of the single-cysteine variants. Conversely, when deleterious mutations are introduced, proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby as stabilising interactions are destroyed the protein still functions until it reaches some stability threshold at which point further destabilising mutations have large, detrimental effects as the protein can no longer fold. This leads to negative epistasis whereby mutations that have little effect alone have a large, deleterious effect together.|$|E

40|$|The HIV {{envelope}} glycoprotein gp 120 contains nine <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> and is highly glyco-sylated, carrying on average 24 N-linked glycans. Using a probability calculation, we here demonstrate {{that there is}} a co-localization of <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> and N-linked glycans in HIV- 1 gp 120, with a predominance of N-linked glycans in close proximity to disulphide brid-ges, at the C-terminal side of the involved cysteines. Also, N-glycans are frequently found immediately adjacent to <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> in gp 120 at the N-terminal side of the involved cysteines. In contrast, N-glycans at positions close to, but not immediately neighboring dis-ulphide bridges seem to be disfavored at the N-terminal side of the involved cysteines. Such a pronounced co-localization of <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> and N-glycans was also found for the N-glycans on glycoprotein E 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) but not for other heavily gly-cosylated proteins such as E 2 from HCV and the surface GP from Ebola virus. The potential functional role of the presence of N-glycans near <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> in HIV- 1 gp 120 was studied using site-directed mutagenesis, either by deleting conserved N-glycans or by inserting new N-glycosylation sites near <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges.</b> The generated HIV- 1 NL 4. ...|$|R

These peptides are homologous to human bridge peptides forming the heavy-light bridge and two inter-heavy bridges, one present in the CMU 2 region and the other in the C-terminal region. The inter-heavy bridge in the Cmu 2 region was alone cleaved and radioactively labelled in selectively reduced IgM held together as a pentamer by non-covalen interactions.

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> among cysteines {{is an important}} feature of protein structures. Here we develop new methods for the prediction of disulphide bond connectivity. We first build a large curated data set of proteins containing <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> and then use 2 -Dimensional Recursive Neural Networks to predict bonding probabilities between cysteine pairs. These probabilities in turn lead to a weighted graph matching problem that can be addressed efficiently. We show how the method consistently achieves better results than previous approaches on the same validation data. In addition, the method can easily cope with chains with arbitrary numbers of bonded cysteines. Therefore, it overcomes {{one of the major}} limitations of previous approaches restricting predictions to chains containing no more than 10 oxidized cysteines. The method can be applied both to situations where the bonded state of each cysteine is known or unknown, in which case bonded state can be predicted with 85 % precision and 90 % recall. The method also yields an estimate for the total number of <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridges</b> in each chain. ...|$|R

50|$|TNMD {{belongs to}} the new family of type II transmembrane glycoproteins. The gene is {{localized}} on the X chromosome and accounts for an approximately 1.4 kb transcript and a predicted protein consisting of 317 amino acids. The gene is composed of seven exons. The second exon encodes the transmembrane domain (amino acid position 31-49) and no signal peptide. TNMD contains a putative protease recognition sequence (Arg-Xxx-Xxx-Arg) identified at the position 233-236. Unlike chondromodulin-1, TNMD {{does not have a}} processing signal for furin protease. The extracellular part, prior the putative cleavage site, contains a BRICHOS extracellular domain found also in several other unrelated proteins. This domain consists of a homologous sequence of approximately 100 amino acids containing a pair of conserved cysteine residues. It has been suggested that BRICHOS participates in the protein post-translational processing, however the exact function remains unclear. TNMD contains two N-glycosylation sites at position 94 and 180. Protein analyses in eye and periodontal ligament revealed full length TNMD protein as a double band of 40 and 45 kDa. It has been experimentally proven that the 45 kDa band corresponds to glycosylated TNMD, while 40 kDa band is non-glycosylated TNMD. The last exon of TNMD gene encodes the conserved C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, which makes up the part of the protein sharing highest resemblance to chondromodulin-I (77% similarity/66% identity). This domain contains C-terminal hydrophobic tail with eight Cys residues forming four disulphide-bridges, which are well conserved across vertebrate species. A smaller cyclic structure forming by single Cys280-Cys292 <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> in TNMD has been shown to exert an anti-angiogenic function, while the other three disulphide-bridges are speculated to hold this cyclic structure and C-terminal hydrophobic tail separated from each other to avoid the formation of intramolecular aggregates. In certain tendon tissues such as Achilles tendon and chordae tendineae cordis, 16 kDa cleaved C-terminal part of TNMD was detected in the collagenous extracellular matrix.|$|E

The purified α-amylase variants demonstrated starch hydrolysis {{resulting in a}} mixture of maltose, maltotriose, and glucose, similar to the wild type enzyme. Introduction of the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> shifted the melting temperature (TM) from 54. 5 to 56 °C and nearly tripled the enzyme half-life time at 65 °C. The two variants have similar kcat/KM values. Similarly, inhibition by acarbose was only slightly affected, with the IC 50 of Sfamy 02 for acarbose being 40 ± 3. 4 μM, while that of Sfamy 01 was 31 ± 3. 9 μM. On the other hand, the IC 50 of Sfamy 02 for EDTA was 0. 45 mM, nearly two times lower than that of Sfamy 01 at 0. 77 mM. These results show that the introduction of a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> had little effect on the enzyme activity, but made the enzyme more susceptible to calcium ion extraction.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the chloroplast H+-ATPase (CFoCF 1) is regulated by the proton electrochemical membrane potential and the reduction or {{the formation of the}} <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> on the gamma-subunit mediated by chloroplast thioredoxins (Trx). The latter regulation also applies to the water-soluble portion of CFoCF 1 (CF 1) and includes two successive steps, namely the binding of Trx to CF 1 and the subsequent reduction or oxidation of CF 1. To study this process thoroughly, a new expression system for spinach Trx-f and Trx-m was designed. In the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) both forms of the expressed Trx could reduce the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> on the gamma-subunit of CF 1 and thus activate the ATPase. Trx mutants deficient in the internal, or both, cysteines of the active site were designed to study the details of the interaction. The Trx mutant proteins could still activate CF 1 -ATPase in the presence of DTT and they also increased the apparent affinity of CF 1 for DTT. This implies that the binding of Trx to the CF 1 gamma-subunit induces a conformational change facilitating the reduction of the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge,</b> and partially explains the high efficiency of Trx as a reductant in vivo...|$|E
