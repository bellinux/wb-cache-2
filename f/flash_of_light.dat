5|$|Mulder and Scully {{return to}} the {{cemetery}} to exhume the other victims {{only to find the}} graves already dug up and the coffins missing. Mulder realizes that Billy Miles is responsible for bringing the victims to the woods. Returning to the woods, they again encounter Detective Miles, but hear a scream and find Billy nearby with Theresa in his arms. There is a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and Billy and Theresa are recovered unharmed.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{the agents}} {{investigate}} the forest; Scully discovers strange ash on the ground, leading her to suspect cult activity. However, a local detective arrives and orders them to leave. Driving {{back to their}} motel, Mulder and Scully encounter a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> at the spot their car had malfunctioned earlier. When the car loses power, Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash, a phenomenon reported by alien abductees.|$|E

5|$|Only one {{historical}} eruption {{is known}} from Burney, which occurred in 1910. This eruption has a {{volcanic explosivity index}} of 2, and was observed by a merchant ship. This eruption appeared to coincide with an earthquake and tsunami on 24 June 1910 in the area. An unconfirmed report of an eruption in 1920 exists, as well as reports of a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and earthquakes during the night of 24 June 1970. No reports of such activity were identified in the contemporaneous newspaper , however.|$|E
5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{contacts}} Frohike and Byers, who {{say that}} Fairfield {{is known for its}} animal disappearances and UFO sightings. They also mention Ambrose's gorilla, who is known to communicate using American Sign Language. Meanwhile, Scully follows one of Lang's activists as he sneaks into the zoo, running into Meecham inside. The activist attempts to free a tiger, but after a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> the tiger seemingly disappears. The activist is promptly mauled to death, with the killing captured on his night vision camera. When questioned, Lang denies any responsibility for the death. Ambrose introduces the agents to the gorilla, Sophie, who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{following}} a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> the stone {{at the base}} of the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to pray, and goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E

25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear density meters {{work on the}} {{principle}} of measuring gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is emitted from a source. This source is typically Cesium-137 (half-life: ~30 years). The radiation is seen by a scintillator device. The radiation is converted into <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is counted. Radiation that is absorbed by the mass is not seen by the scintillator device. Therefore, the density of the media is inversely proportional to the radiation captured and seen by the scintillator.|$|R
25|$|Scintillation {{is defined}} a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{produced}} in a transparent material by {{the passage of}} a particle (an electron, an alpha particle, an ion, or a high-energy photon).

25|$|Seventeen years later, on January 22, 1923, a 7.2 {{earthquake}} centered off Cape Mendocino {{was said}} to be nearly as great a shock in Ferndale as the 1906 earthquake. Chimneys fell, water mains and plate glass windows broke, and the recently repaired Odd Fellows building fell off its new foundation.

25|$|Flash {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the initial brilliant <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> produced by the nuclear detonation. More light energy is received on the retina than can be tolerated, but less than is required for irreversible injury. The retina is particularly susceptible to visible and short wavelength infrared light, since this part of the electromagnetic spectrum is focused by the lens on the retina. The result is bleaching of the visual pigments and temporary blindness for up to 40 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} diagram, the two {{ends of the}} train are drawn as grey lines.

The <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is shown as the 45° red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of the train are at the same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous.|$|E
