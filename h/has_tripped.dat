A Greek search party, including her brother and a jester, arrives to rescue her, after crossing the Indian Ocean. As Chariton, her brother and the fool are discussing their escape, a group of Indian women returning from a hunt encounter them. The jester defends the Greeks with his farts. He asks Chariton to steal items from the temple, but she refuses arguing that robbery would make the gods angry. On the brother's suggestion, the Greeks serve wine to the Indian king and his subjects, intoxicating them. The characters, including the king, then perform a dance for the moon goddess.

50|$|This LED {{is often}} used in {{conjunction}} with a two-stage system, in which the panel requires two devices to be activated (and/or a predetermined time limit to run out after one device is activated) in order to go into full alarm. This is mostly used in areas where false alarms are a common problem, or in large applications (such as hospitals) where evacuating the entire building would not be efficient. The prealarm LED is lit when one device <b>has</b> <b>tripped.</b> The prealarm LED may also be used if an addressable smoke detector registers low levels of smoke in the detection chamber, but not enough to trigger a full alarm. Depending on the system's layout, the NAC's may or may not activate for prealarm conditions. In a two-stage system, the NAC's are typically coded to a special first-stage coding, or in some situations where a loud alarm signal could be disruptive, chimes will activate. If there is a voice evacuation system, it will usually instruct building occupants to await further instructions while the alarm is being investigated.|$|E
5000|$|A {{woman is}} murdered and {{partially}} dismembered in Saltdean, near Brighton. Two local detectives, following up a simple burglary of an estate agent's office, discover {{the body and}} take on {{the investigation of the}} murder. The victim is unidentified and the murder suspect is an unknown man who has used a false identity to rent the house in which the crime was committed. The detectives methodically develop and follow up leads to identify both, mostly in Brighton, but also further afield in Lewes and Greenwich. One lead appears to identify the victim, but their followup reveals that the name is of a woman not only still living, but who was almost a second victim as well. They track down and arrest the suspect described by several persons as the man who leased the house, but the case takes an unexpected turn when he makes his statement confirming what the witnesses saw. After the victim is positively identified, the veteran inspector leading the case develops a [...] "wild idea" [...] on the identity of the suspect, then orders a standard procedure that confirms his theory in a non-standard fashion. The murderer's contention that the death was accidental appears to be foolproof until the detectives realize he <b>has</b> <b>tripped</b> himself up in a single crucial detail.|$|E
5000|$|Honey {{was first}} seen in her pink car, which had eyelashes {{attached}} to the headlights, {{on her way to}} her new job in the ED. She discovers a woman that <b>has</b> <b>tripped</b> and cut open her arm and agrees {{to take her to the}} emergency department with her. She is greeted with a harsh welcome from doctor Lily Chao (Crystal Yu), who dismisses her. Later, after changing into her work attire, Honey announced herself as the new [...] "barrister", but it did not take long for the staff to realise her mistake. Big Mac (Charles Dale) and Noel gave her a warm welcome as she began her new role. She began giving aura readings, making an impact on Max Walker (Jamie Davis) who discovers he has underlying sadness, following his split from Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker). When an elderly lady (Sheila Reid) arrives in the ED seeing angels, Honey begins to relate with her, making a connection. However, when the elderly lady stops relating to Honey, she is left upset. Honey later begins to share a bond with doctor Ethan when she gives him advice to keep for when he is feeling low. When Ethan joined his friends at the local strip club, he was shocked to discover Honey was one of the dancers. He quickly ushered his friends away, before they could discover her secret. Honey later reassured Mac when he thought he could have a brain tumour. Honey later shocked Noel when she revealed he was her father after a one-night stand many years ago. Noel reacts badly, leaving Honey devastated. Honey then tried to get Noel to be proud of her and with help from his friend, Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka), they made progress in their relationship. Honey is left annoyed when she is told she has to re-audtiton for her job as a pole dancer. As she was auditioning, Honey twisted her ankle and wanting to keep her secret discreet, called Ethan to help. At the hospital, Honey revealed she fancied Ethan who felt the same way, but before they could kiss, Noel walked in. Honey made sure her secret job stayed secret from Noel as their relationship progressed. Following their kiss, Ethan gives Honey the cold shoulder, leaving her upset. She tries to gain advice from Lily, but this works to no avail. Elsewhere, Big Mac has arranged a dinner party for himself, Noel, Louise and Honey, but Honey discovers that he is struggling financially. On Valentine's Day, Ethan writes Honey a Valentine's card. However, he is left devastated when she reveals that she is leaving for Manchester to care for her grandmother. Noel is also left in a mood by this, but Ethan makes him see sense. But, before Honey leaves, she kisses Ethan.|$|E

40|$|Paul Williams {{analyses}} Peter Beattie’s two weekend by-election defeats HISTORY {{tells us}} that by-election results {{are not to be}} taken too seriously, that they are one-off polls often unreflective of how voters would behave in a general election. If the 13 per cent swing recorded last Saturday in Chatsworth, for example, was replicated across Queensland, then the Liberals at the next election would win an unprecedented 44 seats, one short of government in their own right. Clearly, from their modest base today of only seven seats, this isn’t about to happen. So while the Liberals are entitled to be jubilant, they also need a reality check. Even with Redcliffe and Chatsworth under their belt, the conservatives collectively boast only 22 out of 89 seats - {{less than a quarter of}} the Legislative Assembly. And while a recent Newspoll put the conservatives’ combined primary vote (42 per cent) ahead of Labor’s (40 per cent) for the first time in years, the number of additional seats required is still too great an ask for a single poll. Government for them is still beyond the horizon. But, having said that, some by-election trends cannot be ignored. The 1975 by-election for the Tasmanian federal seat of Bass, for example, saw Labor lose in a massive swing that accurately forecast the hiding the Whitlam government was to receive a few months later. And the gargantuan swing that saw the National Party lose Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s ultra-safe seat of Barambah in 1988 also painted a fair picture of the Nationals’ bleak future. And so it may be with these by-elections. As Premier Peter Beattie’s greatest political setback to date, Chatsworth may be remembered as the turning point that began the long-awaited Liberal revival in Brisbane: a reversal of their disappointment in the 1997 Kurwongbah by-election and, more significantly, a climb back from their disastrous 1983 rout. But why Chatsworth and not Redcliffe? First, while the swing in Redcliffe, at 8 per cent, was significant (almost double the standard by-election movement), it was dwarfed by that recorded in Chatsworth. Second, Chatsworth is more typical of greater Brisbane, and even parts of the Gold and Sunshine coasts. Put simply, Chatsworth voters are younger, up-and-coming residents with more progressive political values. They have been strong supporters of Beattie, and are precisely the type of electors the Liberals need to win over. Redcliffe, by contrast, is an older and more settled constituency that, in some ways, resembles regional Queensland. The fact the Liberals have polled well among both types of voters only further suggests the Liberals’ revival is genuine. Third, Chatsworth may be remembered for the type of candidate it elected. In successfully moving party president Michael Caltabiano into parliament, the Liberals have caught up with Labor. By blurring their organisational and parliamentary wings, the Liberals can now fully exploit the number-crunching talents of their savvy organisational operators. The ALP, of course, has done this for years, with the ALP state secretaryship a common launch pad for Labor parliamentary careers. Determining why voters acted so resolutely on Saturday is not rocket science. It is, of course, the unfolding drama of the Morris inquiry into the parlous state of Queensland Health. Add to this hostility at retiring sitting members, and a disaster was always in the making. Yet, even beyond this, the Beattie government since February 2004 <b>has</b> <b>tripped</b> from debacle to crisis. From Winegate to Energex, and from Palm Island to the Speaker, for 18 months the government has been in perpetual damage control. Put simply, the electorate is more than a little battle-weary, and even a diversion into the federal issue of industrial relations could not reverse it. DESPITE their glittering success, however, the Liberals face some real challenges. First, can they keep a lid on their factionalism? The fact a key factional heavyweight has now entered parliament as a rival to parliamentary leader Bob Quinn may only exacerbate existing tensions. Second, will their success only strengthen their resolve not to negotiate with the Nationals on a future coalition? If so, this would be a major error on their part. Paradoxically, it’s the Nationals who have been most successful in undermining Labor. Lawrence Springborg’s daily media drip of criticism and Jeff Seeney’s exposure of Dr Jayant Patel have each caused more damage to Beattie than Quinn and Caltabiano combined. Yet the challenges for Peter Beattie appear just as acute. How, for example, can the premier re-invent his leadership style in time for the next election? Clearly, voters are tiring of the premier’s cosy everyman image where he emerges as the perpetually apologetic Mr Fixit. Perhaps Queenslanders are yearning for a more traditional style in the Bjelke-Petersen mould where a leader is tough, uncompromising and less willing to accept blame. If Beattie does change styles, then these by-elections might be remembered as yet another turning point: the moment from which he vowed no more Mr Nice Guy. • Dr Paul Williams is a lecturer in the Department of Politics and Public Policy, Griffith University.
