500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is <b>following</b> <b>me.</b> I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do I feel? As if I am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are <b>following</b> <b>me</b> around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E
500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were <b>following</b> <b>me.</b> Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E

500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. <b>Following</b> <b>me,</b> any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E

2500|$|Before {{directing}} {{his first}} feature, Spanking the Monkey, Russell {{intended to make}} a film [...] "about a guy who sits {{in the back of a}} Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody’s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people." [...] Hitting a writer's block, Russell could not figure out how to make the film work. In the meantime Russell was called for jury duty, after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the Huckabee script. The final idea came to Russell in a dream where [...] "This female detective she was not <b>following</b> <b>me</b> for criminal reasons, but she was <b>following</b> <b>me</b> for spiritual and metaphysical reasons." [...] Russell, who makes a habit of writing his dreams down, knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.|$|E
