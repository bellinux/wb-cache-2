50|$|A {{distinction}} is made between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> of learning. Direct measures, as their name implies, involve directly examining student work products {{to assess the}} achievement of learning outcomes. These work products occur {{in a variety of}} formats including objective tests, and rubric-scored projects, performances, and written work. A recent survey of provosts indicates that classroom based assessment and rubrics are most frequently used. Large scale commercial tests such as the College Learning Assessment (CLA) are used by fewer than 50% use standardized tests according to the survey. <b>Indirect</b> <b>measures</b> focus on data from which one can make inferences about learning. <b>Indirect</b> <b>measures</b> can include surveys on student and faculty perceptions about learning, focus groups, and exit interviews. National surveys such as the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) have become increasing popular <b>indirect</b> <b>measures,</b> with roughly 85% of institutions using these measures according to a recent survey.|$|R

Brazil was granted 108 patents by the USPTO between 2004 and 2008 and 189 between 2009 and 2013. Although Brazil has registered strong growth in this field, compared to other emerging economies, it seems to be relatively less focused on international patenting than on publications.

2500|$|He then tackles the {{question}} of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms [...] "reproductive value." [...] He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection weakens progressively with age late in life (because the fecundity of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by life tables, was an <b>indirect</b> <b>measure</b> of fitness, that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was {{having a conversation with}} a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in the interior of and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an <b>indirect</b> <b>measure</b> of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than most parents might imagine. [...] Parents need to understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E

40|$|Background: Childhood {{overweight}} and obesity remains high, contributing to cardiometabolic risk factors at younger ages. It is unclear which measures of adiposity {{serve as the}} best proxies for identifying children at metabolic risk. This study assessed whether DXA-derived direct measures of adiposity are more strongly related to cardiometabolic risk factors in children than <b>indirect</b> <b>measures.</b> Methods: Anthropometric and DXA measures of adiposity and a comprehensive assessment of cardiometabolic risk factors were obtained in 288, 9 - 12 year old girls, most being of Hispanic ethnicity. Multiple regression models for each metabolic parameter were run against each adiposity measure while controlling for maturation and ethnicity. In addition, regression models including both <b>indirect</b> and direct <b>measures</b> were developed to assess whether using direct measures of adiposity could provide a better prediction of the cardiometabolic risk factors beyond that of using <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> alone. Results: Measures of adiposity were significantly correlated with cardiometabolic risk factors (p < 0. 05) except fasting glucose. After adjusting for maturation and ethnicity, <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> of adiposity accounted for 29 - 34 % in HOMA-IR, 10 - 13 % in TG, 14 - 17 % in HDL-C, and 5 - 8 % in LDL-C while direct measures accounted for 29 - 34 % in HOMA-IR, 10 - 12 % in TG, 13 - 16 % in HDL-C, and 5 - 6 % in LDL-C. The addition of direct measures of adiposity to <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> added significantly to the variance explained for HOMA-IR (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: Anthropometric measures may perform {{as well as the}} more precise direct DXA-derived measures of adiposity for assessing most CVD risk factors in preadolescent girls. The use of DXA-derived adiposity <b>measures</b> together with <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> may be advantageous for predicting insulin resistance risk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Anew chronometric procedure, the Implicit Association Procedure (IAP), {{was adapted}} {{to assess the}} {{implicit}} personality self-concept of shyness. A sample of 300 participants completed a shyness-inducing role play and, {{before or after the}} role play, a shyness IAP, a shyness Implicit Association Test (IAT), and direct self-ratings. The experimental group was instructed to fake nonshyness. The control group did not receive this instruction. IAT and IAP were unaffected by position effects, and were less susceptible to faking than direct self-ratings with regard to mean levels and correlates. Under faking, correlations between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> decreased, and direct but not <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> showed higher correlations with social desirability and lower correlations with observed shyness. Despite many similarities, the true correlation between IAT and IAP was estimated only. 61, indicating high method-specific variance in both procedures.

40|$|Background and objectives: Several information-processing models {{highlight}} the independent roles of controlled and automatic processes in explaining fearful behavior. Therefore, we investigated whether direct measures of controlled processes and <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> of automatic processes predict unique variance components of children's spider fear-related behavior. Method: Seventy-seven children between 8 and 13 years performed an Affective Priming Task (APT) measuring associative bias, a pictorial {{version of the}} Emotional Stroop Task (EST) measuring attentional bias, filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C) {{in order to assess}} self-perceived fear, and took part in a Behavioral Assessment Test (BAT) to measure avoidance of spiders. Results: The SADS-C, EST, and APT did not correlate with each other. Spider fear-related behavior was best explained by SADS-C, APT, and EST together; they explained 51 % of the variance in BAT behavior. Limitations: No children with clinical levels of spider phobia were tested. The direct and the different <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> did no correlate with each other. Conclusions: These results indicate that both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> are useful for predicting unique variance components of fear-related behavior in children. The lack of relations between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>measures</b> may explain why some earlier studies did not find stronger color-naming interference or stronger fear associations in children with high levels of self-reported fear. It also suggests that children with high levels of spider-fearful behavior have different fear-related associations and display higher interference by spider stimuli than children with non-fearful behavior...|$|R
