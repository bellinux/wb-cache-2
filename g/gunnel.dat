25|$|A local promoter, Roger Allen {{spotted the}} group in 1969 and alerted the head of A at Philips Records, Jack Baverstock. The group spent {{a week in the}} Philips studio at Stanhope Place {{recording}} an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to Fontana Records if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens' but eventually agreed to Ambrose Slade, a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade. Baverstock also found the group an agent, John <b>Gunnel,</b> who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur Robert Stigwood.|$|E

He recognizes the man as Raval (Bertil Anderberg), a theologian, who ten years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land. The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again. The servant girl joins the squire. The trio ride into town, where the actors met earlier are performing.

500|$|<b>Gunnel</b> was {{deployed}} {{as part of}} the November 1942 {{invasion of}} French North Africa. Operating conditions for the five submarines sent there were not favorable, due to overcrowded waters, poor weather, and mixed-up signals, and the deployment had no accomplishments. Like many other U.S. submarines, <b>Gunnel</b> was attacked in error by friendly aircraft. The Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) diesels (known as [...] "whores") which powered <b>Gunnel</b> were troublesome; at one point while returning home, drive gears of all four of the main engines were out of commission, and McCain's crew had to rely on their tiny auxiliary engine for the last [...] <b>Gunnel</b> went into the navy yard for an extensive refit and was replaced on patrol station off North Africa by [...] "Pilly" [...] Lent's [...]|$|E

50|$|A new suspect, James Vincent <b>Gunnels,</b> was {{discovered}} when hair {{found on the}} blouse of Kristine Mihelich was later tested for DNA. However, due to {{the condition of the}} hair, only an inconclusive match could be achieved. <b>Gunnels,</b> who was convicted in the past for property crimes, was living in a halfway house. He was released in 2011 as the police lacked the evidence to charge him.|$|R
500|$|After the refit, <b>Gunnel</b> {{was ordered}} to the Pacific Fleet, and in June 1943, went on patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. [...] On June 15, McCain torpedoed and sank the {{freighter}} Koyo Maru (6400 tons) in the Tsushima Strait. [...] Early on June 19, McCain engaged a Japanese convoy that was headed for Shanghai. [...] He torpedoed and sank the freighter Tokiwa Maru (7000 tons) and hit a smaller vessel. [...] The convoy's escorts then staged a prolonged counter-attack on <b>Gunnel,</b> dropping depth charges that shook and damaged the boat and grappling hooks that rattled along its hull.|$|E
500|$|Persistent trouble {{from the}} submarine's diesel engines then cut short the patrol after only eleven days, after which McCain {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor.

While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by <b>Gunnel</b> and his business partner, Animals' bassist, Chas Chandler.

As Chandler had previous managerial experience with Jimi Hendrix, the band accepted.|$|E
