Some of these <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> developed in formal education, others in informal and non-formal education settings. <b>Digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> acquired over time through educational and social use of technology, through formal instruction, informal self-learning and learning from peers.

40|$|In an era {{of rapid}} {{technological}} change, especially considering the rise of robotics and AI, there is widespread anxiety about the impacts of digital technologies across a vast range of industries. Policy responses to this changing employment landscape champion the necessity for growing ‘digital skills’. However, we argue that these dominant macropolitical interpretations draw on a restricted understanding of spatiality where <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> discretely located in particular bodies and in particular geographical locations. The paper develops a novel geographical response through {{an exploration of the}} micropolitics of <b>digital</b> <b>skills.</b> This focuses on the material and practical dimensions of work with digital technologies that produces a more dynamic spatiality and thus a more complex politics of labour. We argue that the dynamic spatiality of <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> can <b>be</b> evaluated according to: (1) site-specific dimensions, as <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> co-minglings of humans and technologies; (2) extensive dimensions, as <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> networked across geographically dispersed sites; and (3) intensive dimensions, as <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> emerge across bodies and environments through repetitive practices. This analysis suggests that policy declarations of <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> ‘shortages’ <b>are</b> problematic, since they overlook the contested and shifting forms of enablement and constraint that labour practices involving digital technologies give rise to. Unpacking this labour politics therefore requires geographical approaches that are adept at grasping these complex spatialities of labour...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we will reflect on the {{evolving}} focus of research on <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> over the past 15 years and discuss the outcomes of this research and their implications for policy. Policy issues regarding <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> have shifted over time.

The argument is organized in four sections, following more or less chronologically the stages of research on <b>digital</b> <b>skills.</b> We begin with the largely descriptive research on <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> {{in the context of the}} digital divide. The second and third sections follow the theoretical turn in the research agenda with a focus on the causes and consequences of differences in <b>digital</b> <b>skills.</b> In the fourth section we discuss a more recent development, where <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> included in a broader research agenda of media literacy...|$|R

40|$|Why does {{it matter}} to clearly define a {{consistent}} understanding of digital skills"? <b>Digital</b> abilities, <b>digital</b> <b>skills,</b> and <b>digital</b> literacy <b>are</b> all examples of terms that are often used to describe a broader understanding of technology in an educational context. Different terms are used to describe different aspects of technology or a rhetorical technique to explain why one understanding is more vital than others. All state funded schools in Norway must address the framework about basic skills", put up by the Knowledge Promotion Reform (Kunnskapsløftet). The basic <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> as follows: Oral skills, reading, writing, numeracy and <b>digital</b> <b>skills.</b> How society understands <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> sets the foundation of how humans can participate in a digital setting. An understanding of <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> also reveals the level of ambitions tied to human's digital interaction and production. The understanding of <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> outside the classroom influences the content learned inside the classroom. My thesis is established {{in light of this}} situation. The thesis examines the conceptual understanding of the term <b>digital</b> <b>skills,</b> attempting to illuminate whether there's a consistency, between the Knowledge Promotion Reform and Norwegian high schools in their understanding of and ambitions behind the term digital skills". Influenced by methodological principles from social constructivism, narrative analysis and hermeneutics, the thesis explores statements that construct stories about <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> from government documents, high school teachers and leaders and various research studies. My findings indicate that there is no clear consistency between the Knowledge Promotion Reform and Norwegian high schools. There is not even a clear consistency between teachers themselves. Furthermore, the results suggest three categories of understanding; technical abilities, pedagogical opportunities and abstract abilities. These findings challenge the assumption on what <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> and how such a <b>skill</b> should <b>be</b> realized in education.

Logistic regressions demonstrate that the level of <b>digital</b> <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> a better predictor of online news use than demographics.
