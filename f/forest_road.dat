5|$|Restoring {{the stream}} {{has made the}} area, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, highly popular. As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of <b>Forest</b> <b>Road</b> 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply. Since 2009, the Forest Service {{has been working on}} a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} within the BRWMU include Forest Road10, which runs {{for much of}} its length along {{the north side of}} the river. It links the {{community}} of Bull Run near the mouth of the river and Forest Road18 (Lolo Pass Road) east of Bull Run Lake. Branching off <b>Forest</b> <b>Road</b> 10 downstream of Reservoir2, Forest Roads12 and 14 form a loop south of the river. The loop extends as far east as Goodfellow Lakes, near the source of the Little Sandy River. Below the BRWMU, Bull Run Road, open to the public, crosses the river between the community of Bull Run and Dodge Park.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E
40|$|The {{categorisation}} of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> can {{be based}} on several different criteria. In this paper, {{the outlines of the}} primary forest traffic infrastructure were divided according to the traffic load typical of long-distance transportation of timber. The survey was conducted in the management unit of Veprinačke šume, forest office of Opatija, forest administration of Buzet. This paper defines the methodology of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> categorisation using the GIS analysis, which should become a mandatory tool in development of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> network in Croatia. Traffic load of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> as a criterion for their categorisation can be used for the rationalisation of construction and maintenance expenses of the primary forest traffic infrastructure, while additional researches should define the standards for construction and maintenance of each category of <b>forest</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R

5|$|Gorkil {{continues}} marching {{west and}} besieges Fornost, the fortified {{ruins of the}} ancient capitol of Arnor. The defenders, consisting of the Dúnedain and Dwarves led by Glóin, crumble under the relentless Goblin attacks, and Eriador falls under Goblin control. Sauron launches a concurrent campaign east of the Misty Mountains. The orcs from Dol Guldur eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the <b>Forest</b> <b>Road</b> in Mirkwood, defeating the Elven lord Thranduil. After the fall of Mirkwood, the Mouth of Sauron leads his horde to Withered Heath to recruit the Dragon Lord Drogoth, after destroying the Dwarves in the area. To finally rid Sauron and Middle Earth of the Dwarves, The Mouth of Sauron attacks the human city of Dale and the Dwarven stronghold of Erebor, led by King Dain. For the final battle against the Good factions in the North, the Goblin horde and Sauron's forces from Mordor converge at Rivendell, the last surviving stronghold against Sauron in Middle-earth. Eagles, the Dead Men of Dunharrow, Galadriel and her surviving Elves, and {{the remnants of the}} Fellowship of the Ring arrive to help Arwen and Elrond, but Sauron (having attained full power through recovering the One Ring from the dead Frodo) and all his gathered forces enter the battle and completely destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E
5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway through {{the small town of}} North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National <b>Forest</b> <b>road.</b> The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E

FORIN is a tool to more efficiently inventory and manage information of <b>forest</b> <b>roads.</b> FORIN is intended for use by field personnel, who will use pen-based computers to improve productivity, accuracy of inventories, to lower the cost, and provide an efficient management tool for <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> inventory. FORIN is a relational database computer system designed for gathering data for <b>forest</b> <b>roads.</b> FORIN displays a menu, which controls the display of all other forms. The main purpose of the forms is for data collection, plus data updates for the roads and their elements. The data entry in the forms will be assisted by a pen-based computer, which will allow for fast, efficient, and accurate data gathering. FORIN replaces the existing paper forms method of inventory with computerized forms, so that collected information can be transcribed into a summary report immediately after the data has been collected and input into the program...|$|R
