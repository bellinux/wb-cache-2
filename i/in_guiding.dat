5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Goebel was {{a friend}} of Gerald R. Ford's mother and {{stepfather}} in Grand Rapids. Goebel played an important role <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> Ford to the University of Michigan. When Ford graduated from Grand Rapids South High School, Goebel recognized Ford’s ability as a football player and recommended him to his former teammate Harry Kipke, who had taken over as Michigan’s head football coach. Kipke recruited Ford, who became Michigan's Most Valuable Player in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury. His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E

5|$|On November 6/7, 1917, Pegahmagabow {{earned a}} Bar to his Military Medal {{for his actions}} in the Second Battle of Passchendaele. During the fighting, Pegahmagabow's {{battalion}} was given the task of launching an attack at Passchendaele. By this time, he had been promoted {{to the rank of}} corporal and during the battle he was recorded playing an important role as a link between the units on the 1st Battalion's flank. When the battalion's reinforcements became lost, Pegahmagabow was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> them and ensuring that they reached their allocated spot in the line.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into {{seventeen}} Planning Districts, {{created in}} 1979 to allow neighborhoods {{to participate in}} governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

5|$|After {{his second}} season in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Ellis was {{selected}} 11th overall by the Predators in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. During his junior career, he was key <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> the Windsor Spitfires to back-to-back Memorial Cups as Canadian Hockey League (CHL) champions in 2009 and 2010. Individually, he {{was named to the}} CHL and OHL All-Rookie Teams in 2008, the First OHL All-Star Team in 2009 and 2011 and the Second OHL All-Star Team in 2010. He was awarded the OHL's Bobby Smith Trophy as the League's scholastic player of the year in 2008, the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the top defenceman in 2009 and 2011 and the Red Tilson Trophy as the most outstanding player in 2011. On a national basis, he was named CHL Defenceman and Player of the Year in 2011. Serving as the Spitfires' team captain in 2010–11, he became the franchise's all-time leading point-scorer among defencemen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia is a {{relatively}} open state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy. The state plays a significant but declining role <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> economic activity through macroeconomic plans. Malaysia has {{had one of the}} best economic records in Asia, with GDP growing an average 6.5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005. Malaysia's economy in 2014–2015 {{was one of the most}} competitive in Asia, ranking 6th in Asia and 20th in the world, higher than countries like Australia, France and South Korea. In 2014, Malaysia's economy grew 6%, the second highest growth in ASEAN behind the Philippines' growth of 6.1%. The economy of Malaysia in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2014 was $746.821billion, the third largest in ASEAN behind more populous Indonesia and Thailand and the 28th largest in the world.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role <b>in</b> <b>guiding</b> evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
