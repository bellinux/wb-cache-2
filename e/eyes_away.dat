25|$|Agricola {{was spared}} those later years during which Domitian, leaving now no {{interval}} or breathing space of time, but, as it were, with one continuous blow, drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth... It {{was not long}} before our hands dragged Helvidius to prison, before we gazed on the dying looks of Manricus and Rusticus, before we were steeped in Senecio's innocent blood. Even Nero turned his <b>eyes</b> <b>away,</b> and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...|$|E
25|$|Tersâne-i Âmire was the Imperial {{shipyard}}, on the Golden Horn. The shipyard {{was founded}} on the Golden Horn in 1453, after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, and initially called the Galata Shipyard. In the 16th century it {{became known as the}} Tersâne-i Âmire and was greatly expanded, with 140 docks and a perimeter wall to keep prying <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> from naval secrets; it took over from the main shipyard at Gallipoli. From this time on, the Tersâne-i Âmire {{was at the heart of}} shipbuilding and naval governance in the Ottoman Empire. However, the shipyard suffered ups and downs with the rest of the empire. There were reforms and expansions after the Battle of Lepanto in 1571; in 1601 the shipyard had 3524 employees but this steadily fell to 726 in 1700; during this period an increasing amount of work was done by other shipyards. By the reign of Abdülmecid I (r. 1839–1861), the Tersane-i Amire had fallen into neglect and underinvestment; Abdülmecid started a massive investment programme which modernised not just the Tersane-i Amire but also shipyards in Izmit and Gemlik.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "heartbroken ballad", where Spears {{declares}} on the introduction, [...] "You tell me you're {{in love with me}} / That you can't take your pretty <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But every time you come too close I move away". According to musicologist Melanie Lowe, [...] "Spears shows a different side of her personality [...] than she does in her other songs." [...] Both of them also commented the song [...] "lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy".|$|E

500|$|His body arches, forcing {{his torso}} to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds {{in his hands}} as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the {{physical}} reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, {{may be influenced by}} earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; [...] "Turn your <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man".|$|E
500|$|The second {{investigations}} performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and {{the local}} press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> and heard 5 gunshots." [...] Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, {{although he did not}} witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.|$|E
500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} {{all right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, noting {{that while the}} first half of the episode had much exposition, once Olivia was recovered, the {{emotional}} connection between all the main characters and the closing moments significantly improved the episode. Zap2It's Carina Adly MacKenzie believed that with the season premiere, [...] "Fringe completely reinvented itself," [...] citing as evidence the lack of pressure to attract new viewers and instead the desire to please longtime fans. She called Haig a [...] "revelation" [...] and noted her resemblance to Torv, whom Adly MacKenzie asserted was [...] "per usual, heartbreakingly perfect." [...] The Zap2It reviewer also found Walter's torture [...] "tough to watch, but we can't tear our <b>eyes</b> <b>away</b> from John Noble's award-worthy performance." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jeff Jensen criticized Peter and Olivia's break-up backstory, believing it was not compatible with their known timeline and also because [...] "it felt to me like Fringe was making more out of the matter than it should have, trying too hard to make some emotional drama, to give Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson something to play." [...] Jensen concluded his review by noting the series' departure from the old episode formula of [...] "imbu the inhuman with as much emotional resonance as their human character" [...] in favor of [...] "a swift-moving serialized thriller," [...] and hoped the change [...] "has the weight and power that we've come to expect." ...|$|E
