50|$|Nevadaite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the <b>Gold</b> <b>Quarry</b> mine {{near the town of}} Carlin, Eureka County, Nevada. The unique conditions and amounts of phosphate, vanadate, arsenate, and uranate in this area {{led to the formation of}} two new minerals; one being nevadaite and the other being goldquarryite. The <b>Gold</b> <b>Quarry</b> mine has been operated by The Newmont Mining Corporation since 1985 for the extraction of Carlin-type gold deposits.|$|E

The NSM royalty {{in this case}} gave Franco Nevada the option of collecting in cash or in-kind (metal product output).|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experiment at the <b>Gold</b> <b>Quarry</b> pit, operated by the Newmont Gold Company at Carlin, NV The purpose of the experiment was to obtain local and regional seismic data, together with ``ground truth``, from conventional surface blasting activity and to use these data to help determine the effectiveness with which conventional mining blasts can be discriminated from underground nuclear explosions...|$|E
5000|$|A now {{disappeared}} local stone quarry was {{the source}} of [...] "Attleborough Sandstone" [...] a very popular high-quality building stone that was once used in the construction of numerous up-market buildings, particularly churches, in the local area. A noted example is the parish church, St Margaret's, in Stoke <b>Golding.</b> The <b>quarry</b> operated from medieval times until the 1930s when the stone was worked-out. It was subsequently used as a rubbish tip and infilled. It is now covered by housing and a recreation ground. Quarry Lane provides a reminder of its existence.|$|R

25|$|In 1885, the {{railroad}} came northward through the Cajon Pass {{and established a}} train stop, calling it Victor (Victorville) on the Mojave River in the area then known as Mormon Crossing. John Brown helped build {{some of the first}} roads through Apple Valley opening up freight and stagecoach travel from the mining camps at Gold Mountain and Holcomb Valley to {{the railroad}}. In the 1860s, Mormon pioneer LaFayette Mecham built the wagon road, a short cut across the desert, now known as Stoddard Wells Road. Over the next few decades, Victorville boomed as the commercial center of the area with <b>gold</b> refineries, <b>quarries,</b> dance halls and saloons, while Apple Valley remained more pastoral with ranches and apple orchards.|$|R
40|$|Nevadaite, (Cu 2 +,, Al, V 3 +) 6 (PO 4) 8 F 8 (OH) 2 (H 2 O) 22, {{is a new}} {{supergene}} mineral {{species from}} the <b>Gold</b> <b>Quarry</b> mine, near Carlin, Eureka County, Nevada, U. S. A. Nevadaite forms radiating clusters to 1 mm of prismatic crystals, locally covering sur-faces more that 2 cm across; individual crystals are elongate on [001] with a length:width ratio of> 10 : 1 and a maximum diameter of ~ 30 m. It also occurs as spherules and druses associated with colorless to purple-black fluellite, colorless wavellite, strengite– variscite, acicular maroon-to-red hewettite, and rare anatase, kazakhstanite, tinticite, leucophosphite, torbernite and tyuyamunite. Nevadaite is pale green to turquoise blue with a pale powder-blue streak and a vitreous luster; it does not fluoresce under ultra-violet light. It has no cleavage, a Mohs hardness of ~ 3, is brittle with a conchoidal fracture, and has measured and calculated densities of 2. 54 and 2. 55 g/cm 3, respectively. Nevadaite is biaxial negative, with 1. 540, 1. 548, 1. 553, 2 V(obs.) = 76 °, 2 V(calc.) = 76 °, pleochroic with X pale greenish blue, Y very pale greenish blue, Z blue, and with absorption Z>> X> Y and orientation X = c, Y = a, Z = b. Nevadaite is orthorhombic, space group P 21 mn, a 12. 123 (2), b 18. 999 (2), c 4. 961 (1) Å,...|$|E
