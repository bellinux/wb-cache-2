40|$|AbstractBackground: Environmental contaminants, such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) {{and other}} {{structurally}} related ‘environmental hormones’, exert their harmful biological effects through the Ah receptor signaling pathway. Several naturally occurring substances also bind to this receptor, but its natural role is still obscure. Tryptophan derivatives of the indolo[3, 2 -b]carbazole type, earlier suggested by {{us to be}} endogenous ligands for the receptor, should be a powerful tool in understanding receptor function. We therefore: set out to determine their identity. Results: The two tryptophan-derived Ah receptor ligands have been chemically analyzed and characterized by means of mass spectrometry, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. UV, infra-red and fluorescence spectra were also recorded.

The yield of biaryl formed from homolytic arylation of benzene decreases as o-bromoaniline, 2, 4, 6 -tribromoaniline or pentabromoaniline are {{the sources of the}} aryl radicals. This decrease is paralleled by an increase in the yield of the benzene derivative arising from the formal protodeamination of the parent aniline <b>derivative.</b> <b>Evidence</b> was also found of a heterolytic reaction accompanying the main homolytic arylation reaction which gives hexabromobenzene as a side-product in the reaction of pentabromoaniline and pentyl nitrite in benzene. Photochemical bromination {{reactions of}} some benzene derivatives, using molecular bromine as the source of bromine atoms, were performed. Both nuclear addition and nuclear substitution products were formed, the relative amounts of which vary with the benzene derivative since both polar and steric factors influence these reactions. However, {{it was found that the}} ratio of nuclear substitution to nuclear addition increased with increase in temperature from ca. 25 to ca. 50 °. Evidence (i. e. the photochemical decomposition of benzene hexabromide and of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexabromochlorocyclohexane to give some di-halo-arenes) was adduced which suggests an addition-elimination mechanism as an interpretation of the formation of bromo-arenes in the photochemical bromination of benzene derivatives.
