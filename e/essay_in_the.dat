5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} an <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yale Law Journal, {{on the death}} penalty and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's All Things Considered program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US Senator Bob Dole (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from Death Row.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt's {{criticism}} of Tooke's grammatical work {{has also been}} singled out. Critic Tom Paulin notes the way Hazlitt's subtle choice of language hints at the broader, politically radical implications of Tooke's linguistic achievement.

25|$|In {{the second}} <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series, Winchester {{described}} three scientific theories on {{the origins of}} the universe, identifying her own view as the “planetesimal theory,” which held that the observable universe developed as gravitational forces caused matter to coalesce over long eons of time. Nazarene theologian A. M. Hills embraced the identical view when he discussed the Christian doctrine of creation in his 2-vol Fundamental Christian Theology. While neither believed in biological evolution, Winchester and Hills embraced cosmic and geological evolution without compunction.|$|E
