40|$|A {{gas turbine}} disc has three {{critical}} regions for which lifing calculations are essential: the assembly holes or weld areas, the hub region, and the blade-disc attachment area. Typically, a <b>firtree</b> joint {{is used to}} attach the blades to the turbine disc instead of a dove-tail joint, which is commonly used for compressor discs. A <b>firtree</b> joint involves contact between two surfaces at more than one location which makes the joint more difficult to design. Large loads generated due to the centrifugal action of the disc and associated blades are distributed over multiple areas of contact within the joint. All of the contacts in a <b>firtree</b> joint are required to be engaged simultaneously when the blades are loaded. However, slight variations {{in the manufacture of}} these components can have an impact on this loading. It is observed that small changes in the geometric entities representing contact between the two bodies can result in variations in the stress distribution near contact edges and the notch regions. Even though manufacturing processes have advanced considerably in the last few decades, the variations in geometry due to these processes cannot be completely eliminated. Hence, it is necessary to design such components in the presence of uncertainties in order to minimise the variation observed in their performance. In this work, the variations in geometry due to the manufacturing processes used to produce <b>firtree</b> joints between a gas turbine blade and the disc are evaluated. These variations are represented in two different ways using measurement data of <b>firtree</b> joints obtained from a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) : (i) the variation for the pressure angle in the <b>firtree</b> joint is extracted from a simple curve fit and (ii) using the same measurement data, the unevenness of the pressure surfaces is represented using a Fourier series after filtering noise components. A parametric computer aided design (CAD) model which represents the manufacturing variability is implemented using Siemens NX. Non-smooth surfaces are also numerically generated by assuming the surface profile to be a random process. Two- and three-dimensional elastic stress analysis is carried out on the <b>firtree</b> joint using the finite element code, Abaqus and the variations observed in the notch stresses with changing pressure angle are extracted. A surrogate assisted multiobjective optimisation is performed on the <b>firtree</b> joint based on the robustness principles. Kriging based models are used to build a surrogate for notch stresses and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is implemented to perform a multiobjective optimisation in order to minimise the mean and standard deviation of the notch stresses. An iterative search algorithm that updates the Kriging models with equally spaced infill points from the predicted Pareto front is adopted. Finally, a new design of the <b>firtree</b> joint is obtained which has better performance with respect to the variation in the notch stresses due to manufacturing uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} evolutionary optimisation of a turbine blade <b>firtree</b> root local profile is presented. The <b>firtree</b> geometry is designed using an intelligent rule-based computer-aided design system (ICAD) and analysed using an industrial-strength finite element code. A {{large number of}} geometric and mechanical constraints drawn from past experience are incorporated {{in the design of}} the model. The high computational cost associated with finding optimal designs using high-fidelity codes is addressed using a surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm. The initial surrogate model is first built based on points sampled with a design-of-experiment method. A database of designs analysed using the high-fidelity code is built and augmented while the genetic algorithm progresses. In the procedure for deciding whether the high-fidelity code should be run, a simple 3 ? principle is used instead of searching for the point with maximum expected improvement. This is combined with an appropriate ranking of the design points within the database. Some benchmark test problems are first used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework. When applied to the problem of local shape optimisation of a turbine blade <b>firtree</b> root, significant improvement is achieved using a limited computational budget...|$|E
40|$|In the {{structure}} task, the goals for this reporting period were to: (1) complete analyses of field {{work on the}} NNW-SSE transect along {{the west side of}} Cayuga Lake. We have completed data input and analyses for this goal, and discuss the results. The additional data from the 2002 field season (and additional revised data from the previous season) demonstrate that zones of closely-spaced E-striking fractures bear a close spatial correlation with the E-striking <b>Firtree</b> Anticline. East-striking EarthSat (1997) Landsat lineaments also occur in the same general region as the <b>Firtree</b> Anticline. However, one E-striking lineament occurs where we have no sites with a high E-striking fracture frequency. ENE-striking closely-spaced fractures occur where ENE-striking lineaments occur. From the Seneca lake transect, these fractures intensification domains and lineaments are thought to mark zones of reactivated Trenton/Black River faults. In the advanced seismic analyses task, the goals for this reporting period were to complete analyses of the seismic data. We have completed data the data analyses and find that high porosity zones can be recognized along some of the Trenton/Black River fault zones. These data continue to demonstrate that integration of aeromagnetic and Landsat lineaments, surface structure, soil gas and seismic allows us to extrapolate Trenton-Black River trends away from confirmatory seismic lines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{fracture}} investigation of second stage turbine blades in a 32 MW unit in a thermal power plant. The premature failure of the blades, made of nickel based superalloy Udimet 500, occurred after a service life of 50000 h and caused extensive damage to the unit. Several fractured blades were retrieved from the unit to identify the cause of failure. The investigation included visual examination, SEM fractography, chemical analysis, hardness measurement, and microstructural characterization. Detailed examinations of the blades indicated that the primary failure event {{was related to the}} fracture of a turbine blade at the top <b>firtree</b> root. The fracture surface morphology exhibited features characteristic of slow stable crack growth by crystallographic faceted cracking and striation formation that was terminated by interdendiritic fracture at the final stage of failure. These together with the results of macrofractographic observations identified high cycle fatigue as the primary contributing fracture mechanism. The main fatigue crack initiated on a surface that was damaged by fretting wear as evident from the debris on the contact surfaces of the <b>firtree</b> joint. The physical characteristics of fretting damage in relation to crack initiation are discussed based on the microstructural and fractographic findings presented...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Corrosion and fatigue aspects of high temperature turbine components made from Alloy 720 Li and RR 1000 have been studied {{with a view to}} understanding the potential failure mechanisms occurring in these materials. Understanding of such failure mechanisms is important in order to make safety improvements and significant cost savings by reducing engine downtime. Some exservice discs currently exhibit pit-like features at a specific location on the <b>firtree</b> lobes, which potentially may lead to more serious alloy fissuring. Shot peening is currently employed to improve fatigue resistance at the surface of components. This work aims to fully characterise these pits and fissure features in addition to shot peening, and the components in general, using advanced analytical techniques, in order that the failure mechanism(s) can be determined and mitigated against.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a general shape optimisation method for a structural optimisation problem using a combined feature-based and B-spline based free form geometry modelling approach. The geometry {{is defined by}} a number of features for the global shape and by Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS), via the use of control points for the local shape. The coordinates of the control points along with other dimensions are chosen as design variables. A knot insertion/removal process is introduced to increase flexibility and to obtain a compact definition of the final optimised shape. Here the geometry is modelled using an intelligent CAD system (ICAD), which enables complete automation of the design-toanalysis process. Stresses are obtained from finite element analysis. A two-stage hybrid strategy is used to solve the formulated optimisation problem. Its application to the design of a turbine disc <b>firtree</b> root is demonstrated. This new approach is compared to a more traditional optimisation analysis using a geometry model based on straight-lines and circulararcs. Improvements in the objective function and flexibility in geometry definition are achieved compared to designs obtained using the traditional approach...|$|E

Preliminary tests results showed that machined surfaces with Ra of ~ 0. 5 μm, less than 2 μm of recast layer and almost neutral residual stresses were obtained following a roughing and four finishing passes. In a subsequent phase it was possible {{to reduce the number of}} finishing passes into only 2 while maintaining similar surface integrity figures, where also it was possible to wire machine <b>firtree</b> slots geometrical accuracy of ± 7 μm. This phase also entailed extensive assessment of the impact of pulse shape on surface integrity when using similar pulse energies. Fatigue performance tests proved no statistically significant differences between WEDM and flank milling at 5 % level. The research also investigated the use of coated wires and oil based dielectric compared to standard brass wire and de-ionised water, where significant differences in productivity were recorded...|$|E
40|$|In the {{structure}} task, for this reporting period, {{the authors also}} edited and revised the map that displays the modified rose diagrams for the data they collected and reduced along {{the east side of}} Seneca Lake. They also revised the N-S transect that displays the frequency of ENE-striking fractures, and constructed a new N-S transect that shows the frequency of E-striking fractures. This transect compliments the earlier transect they constructed for fracture frequency of ENE-striking fractures. Significantly, the fracture frequency transect for E-W fractures shows a spike in fracture frequency in the region of the E-striking <b>Firtree</b> anticline that is observed on seismic reflection sections. The ENE fracture set does not exhibit an unusually high fracture frequency in this area. In contrast, the fracture frequency of the ENE-striking set is anomalously high in the region of the Trenton/Black River grabens. They have nearly completed reducing the data they collected from a NNW-SSE transect {{on the west side of}} Cayuga Lake and they have constructed modified rose diagrams for most sites. Structure contour maps and isopach maps have been revised based on additional well log analyses. Except for the Glodes Corners Field, the well spacing generally remains insufficient to identify faults or their precise locations. However, relatively sharp elevational changes east of Keuka Lake support the contention that faults occur along the east side of Keuka Lake. Similarly, a single well east of Seneca Lake shows that the Trenton there is low compared to distant wells, based on an assumed regional slope. This same area is where one of the Trenton grabens occurs. They have completed the interpretation of the reprocessed data that Quest licensed and had reprocessed. Several grabens observed in the Trenton and Black River reflectors are consistent with surface structure, soil gas, and aeromagnetic anomalies. In this report they display all four interpreted seismic lines. These data indicate that integration of aeromagnetic and topographic lineaments, surface structure, soil gas with seismic and well logs allows them to extrapolate Trenton-Black River trends away from confirmatory seismic lines...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} was to enter Phase 2 by {{analyzing}} geophysical logs and sidewall cores from a verification well drilled into the Trenton/Black River section along lineaments. However, the well {{has not yet been}} drilled; Phase 2 has therefore not been accomplished. Secondary goals, not dependent upon well drilling, were completed. In the structure task, the objectives for this reporting period were to: (1) add additional sites along the west side of Cayuga Lake where we had critical gaps in our data set, and (2) complete analyses of structure data along the west side of Cayuga Lake. We have completed data input and analyses for this goal, and discuss the results. The additional data from the 2003 field season (and additional revised data from the previous season) demonstrate that zones of closely-spaced NNW- and N-striking fractures (FIDs) occur west of Cayuga Lake. EarthSat (1997) did not recognize NNW- or N-striking Landsat lineaments in this area. Packets of E-and ENE-striking EarthSat (1997) lineaments coincide with FIDs observed in outcrop, but the bedrock FIDs are significantly more numerous than the lineaments. West of Cayuga Lake, NE-striking EarthSat (1997) were not confirmed by FIDs. It appears that Landsat lineaments (EarthSat, 1997) indicate parts of the structural fabric, but the ground-truthing reveals added significant complexity. The E-striking lineaments and FIDs are related to Alleghanian folds and faults (e. g., <b>Firtree</b> Anticline), and the ENE-striking lineaments and FIDs are probably related to reactivated Trenton/Black River faults. ASTER images, with an order of magnitude higher resolution than Landsat, are presently being analyzed for lineaments. The lineament patterns are more complex than the Landsat lineaments, and include a number of trends not observed in the Landsat data (EarthSat, 1997). These trends include NS, NNW and NNE. These data continue to demonstrate that integration of aeromagnetic and remote sensing lineaments, surface structure, soil gas and seismic allows us to extrapolate Trenton-Black River trends away from confirmatory seismic lines...|$|E
