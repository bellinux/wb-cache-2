40|$|Background and Objectives: Within recent years, the {{insufflation}} {{technique for}} laparoscopy {{has become more}} important with high flow insufflators (� 30 L/min) and high gas turn over (� 800 L/procedure). Increased amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas used can lead to laparoscopic hypothermia. We studied the insufflator with versus insufflators without internal gas heating (inside insufflator) as a sufficient method of hypothermia prevention at different flow rates. Methods: With a computer-based data acquisition model, different standard insufflators with internal gas heating (Snowden Pencer) vs. without (Storz Endoflator, Storz Laparoflator, Richard Wolf, and BEI Medical) were compared regarding CO 2 gas temperature {{at different points in}} the insufflation system (insufflator exit, insufflation <b>hose</b> <b>end).</b> Results: Gas temperature of the Snowden Pencer insufflator, which is flow-rate dependent, increases at the exit (max. 35. 4 °C). However, gas temperature is back to room temperature (- 0. 22 to � 1. 10 °C) {{at the end of the}} insufflation hose (10 ft or 3 m) for all 5 insufflators studied. Even at high gas flow rates (� 20 L/min), CO 2 gas is at room temperature when it reaches the patient. Discussion: No difference was noted regarding gas temperature between the insufflators compared. Insufflator internal gas heating, such as the Snowden Pencer insufflator, can not have a clinically significant effect because i...|$|E
50|$|Bringing rm {{back into}} the picture is like making holes in a garden hose. The more holes, the faster the water will escape from the hose, and the less water will travel {{all the way from}} the {{beginning}} of the <b>hose</b> to the <b>end.</b> Similarly, in an axon, some of the current traveling longitudinally through the axoplasm will escape through the membrane.|$|R
50|$|Air brakes need a tap to {{seal the}} <b>hose</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the train. If these taps are {{incorrectly}} closed, a loss of brake force may occur, leading to a dangerous runaway. With vacuum brakes, the <b>end</b> of the <b>hose</b> can be plugged into a stopper which seals the hose by suction. It is much harder to block the hose pipe compared to air brakes.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be wire clamps. An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the <b>hose,</b> one <b>end</b> attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R

50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake <b>hose</b> from the <b>end</b> of the steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure.
