50|$|Brassica carinata (Ethiopian rape, <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard,</b> Abyssinian mustard) is {{a member}} of the Triangle of U species (U, 1935) in the agriculturally {{significant}} Brassica genus. It has 34 chromosomes with genome composition BBCC, and is thought to result from an ancestral hybridisation event between Brassica nigra (genome composition BB) and Brassica oleracea (genome composition CC) (Prakash and Hinata, 1980). Although B. carinata is cultivated as an oilseed crop in Ethiopia (Alemayehu and Becker, 2004), it has generally high levels of undesirable glucosinolates and erucic acid (Getinet et al. 1997), making it a poor choice for general cultivation as an oilseed crop in comparison to the closely related Brassica napus (Rapeseed).|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out with the {{objective}} to estimate the genotypic variability and other yield related traits of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> in North West Ethiopia. A total of 36 genotypes of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> were considered for this study. Analysis of variance was computed to contrast the variability within the collected genotypes based on yield and other yield related traits. The results revealed highly significant values(p< 0. 01) for days to maturity, grain filling period, number of pod per plot, secondary branches per plant, harvest index, seed yield per plot, seed yield per hectare and oil content. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) were noted for days to flowering, plant height, primary branch per plant, biomass per plot, oil yield per plot differences among the genotypes. Genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV %) was lower than phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV %) for all the traits studied. High genetic advance with heritability was observed in the following characters; plant height, biomass of the plant, number of secondary branch per plant and grain filling period. There are variations in the extent of genetic variability, heritability and genetic advance of traits which can facilitate selection for further improvement of important traits of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard.</b> Therefore, {{it can be concluded}} that the variability within <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> genotypes collected from different areas of northern Ethiopia is high and vital for better crop improvement...|$|E
40|$|Shallot (Allium cepa L. var. ascalonicum) is {{the most}} {{traditional}} vegetable crop in Ethiopia. Shallot is susceptible {{to a number of}} diseases that reduce yield and quality, among which fusarium basal rot (FBR) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae (Foc) {{is one of the most}} important yield limiting factors in Ethiopia. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Brassica crops for the management of shallot FBR on shallot. The experiments were carried out at Debre Zeit Agricultural Research Center using cabbage (Brassica oleracea), garden cress (Lepidium sativum), Ethiopia mustard (B. carinata), and rapeseed (B. napus). The evaluations were done under in vitro and greenhouse conditions. Under in vitro test condition it was confirmed that extracts of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> and rapeseed showed higher inhibition on the growth of Foc pathogen compared to control. Data on seedling emergence, plant height, plant stand, disease incidence, severity, cull bulbs, and bulb weight were collected in greenhouse experiment.

40|$|A {{renewable}} biofuel {{economy is}} projected as a pathway to decrease dependence {{on fossil fuels}} {{as well as to}} reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Ethanol produced on large-scale from lignocellulosic raw materials is considered the most potential next generation automotive fuel. In this paper, a Life Cycle Assessment model was developed to evaluate the environmental implications of the production of ethanol from five lignocellulosic materials: alfalfa stems, poplar, <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard,</b> flax shives and hemp hurds and its use in passenger cars. Two ethanol-based fuel applications, E 10 (a mixture of 10 % ethanol and 90 % gasoline by volume) and E 85 (85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline by volume) were assessed and the results were compared to those of conventional gasoline (CG) in an equivalent car. The environmental performance was assessed in terms of fossil fuels requirements, global warming, photochemical oxidant formation, acidification and eutrophication by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology in order to identify the best environmental friendly lignocellulosic source. The results show that, compared to CG, life cycle greenhouse gases emissions are lower for etanol blends, specifically up to 145 % lower for E 85 -fueled car derived from <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard.</b> This crop is also the best option in terms of eutrophying emissions regardless the ratio of ethanol in the blend. In the remaining impact categories, other feedstocks are considered beneficial, that is, poplar in the case of photochemical oxidants formation and flax shives for acidification. Concerning fossil fuels requirements, decreases up to 10 % and 63 % for E 10 and E 85 derived from hemp hurds and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard,</b> respectively, were obtained. According to the results, the study clearly demonstrates the importance of using low intensive energy and high biomass yield crops. LCA procedure helps to identify the key areas in the ethanol production life cycle where the researchers and technicians need to work to improve the environmental performance. Technological development could help in lowering both the environmental impact and the prices of the ethanol fuels.

We investigated genetic diversity and correlations for floral and seed characteristics among 14 accessions of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> to improve seed set and yield. Field trials were conducted during 2008 and 2009; flowers were examined for short stamen height, long stamen height, pistil height, and silliqua for seed weight, seeds/silliqua and silliqua/plant. Results were largely consistent between years, indicating that the variation measured was mainly controlled by genetic factors. High genetic variation for seed characters and reproductive phenology among the accessions was noted. The number of days to appearance of flowers showed high discriminatory ability among the accessions. A wide continuous variation was observed among accessions for anther-stigma separation. Accessions 1, 3 and 14 were identified as early flowering. A significant and positive correlation coefficient between short stamen height and seed weight indicated a substantial complementation among these characters for seed yield improvement. The short stamen height is a good indicator for selection in favour of seed commercialization and indices for selection of pollen parent for seed yield improvement.

A set of 83 accessions of B. carinata, collected from the Australian Grains Genebank, was evaluated for pod shatter resistance based on pod rupture energy (RE). In comparison to B. napus (RE = 2. 16 mJ), B. carinata accessions had higher RE values (2. 53 to 20. 82 mJ). A genetic linkage map of an F 2 population from two contrasting B. carinata selections, BC 73526 (shatter resistant with high RE) and BC 73524 (shatter prone with low RE) comprising 300 individuals, was constructed using a set of 6, 464 high quality DArTseq markers and subsequently used for QTL analysis.

40|$|Plastochromanol- 8 and {{tocopherols}} {{are natural}} antioxidants with vitamin E activity that protect {{seeds and plants}} from oxidative damage. Whereas α-tocopherol is predominant in photosynthetic tissues, γ-tocopherol is more abundant in seeds. <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica carinata A.

The objective {{of this research was}} to study changes in plastochromanol- 8 and tocopherol contents during seed germination in <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> lines with contrasting seed tocopherol levels, and to evaluate their influence on seed germination and seedling growth. Cotyledons and radicles of seven lines with contrasting seed tocopherol levels and a control line were sampled periodically until 120 h after sowing (HAS) under light and dark conditions, and were analysed for plastochromanol- 8 and tocopherol contents. The main factors genotype, tissue, light and HAS were significant for all the traits, excepting the light effect for total tocopherol content. Most of the lines showed a gradual decrease in γ-tocopherol that was nearly completely replaced by α-tocopherol at 120 HAS. However, line BCT- 4, with high γ-tocopherol content in seeds, exhibited unusually high γ-tocopherol content in cotyledons and radicles during the whole sampling period. Light treatment and initial seed tocopherol levels had no influence on germination percentage. Despite significant differences for seedling development among genotypes, no clear association between seedling development and seed tocopherols was observed. The results revealed that the unusual presence of high γ-tocopherol levels in cotyledons and radicles of line BCT- 4 did not have an effect on seedling growth. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

Concerns arising from climate change and decisions resulting from the Kyòto Protocol have helped reinforce the idea that multifunctional farms can make a real contribution to achieving the targets set for 2012.

One of the major constraints in studying the relationship between thrips vectors and tospoviruses is the difÞculty of identifying the vector species because of high intraspeciÞc variation among thrips populations. Molecular approacheshavebeenused to identify species differences. In this study, partial cytochromeoxidase I (COI) sequenceswere used to understand the phylogenetic relationship among thrips populations, and assess their usefulness to identify and classify unknown thrips species collected from different crops. In total, 29 COI variants were obtained while examining the sequence poly-morphisms in COI of 182 insects analyzed in this study, which were collected from six countries on tomato, chilli, onion, cabbage, cucumber, watermelon, <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard,</b> French bean, and peanut. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the insects {{used in this study}} clustered with Þve distinct species-groups designated as Thrips palmi group, T. tabaci group, Frankliniella occidentalis group, Scirtothrips dorsalis group and an unclassiÞed group.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{worldwide}} biofuel production increased up to 105 billion liters in 2010; in this year, the world’s first biodiesel producer was the European Union. Biodiesel is produced {{from a variety}} of oils, mainly soybean, Brassicaceae and sunflower. One of the most important biodiesel production byproducts are seed meals. The most common use of seed meals is for animal nutrition, but another potential use is agricultural soil organic amendments. Soil biological and biochemical properties have been widely used as soil quality indicators, due to their quick response to changes in soil management. Although there are many studies on the effects of regular amendments on respiration and enzymatic activities of the soil, very few papers refer to the effect of seed meals. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the short-term effect of seed meal amendment on soil respiration and enzymatic activities (alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, arylsulphatase and -glucosidase). The two seed meals used were obtained from Brassica carinata (A.) Braun (<b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard)</b> and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The study was carried out, from June 2007 to October 2007, at an experimental farm of CRA-ORT, Battipaglia, in the Sele River (Plain Salerno, Campania Region, Italy). The results of this study support an alternative use of seed meals as organic amendments. Generally, a significant positive response of enzymatic activities, evaluated in this study, to the addition of seed meals, indicates a beneficial effect on soil quality as regards microbial activity...|$|E
40|$|Black rot {{caused by}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) {{is a very}} {{important}} disease of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis group) resulting into 10 – 50 % yield losses every year. Since there is a dearth of availability of resistance to black rot disease in B. oleracea (C genome), therefore exploration of A and B genomes was inevitable as they have been reported to be potential reservoirs of gene(s) for resistance to black rot. To utilize these sources, interspecific hybrid and backcross progeny (B 1) were generated between cauliflower “Pusa Sharad” and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> “NPC- 9 ” employing in vitro embryo rescue technique. Direct ovule culture method was better than siliqua culture under different temperature regime periods. Hybridity testing of F 1 inter-specific plants was carried out using co-dominant SSR marker and Brassica B and C genome-specific (DB and DC) primers. Meiosis in the di-genomic (BCC) interspecific hybrid of B. oleracea botrytis group (2 n = 18, CC) × B. carinata (2 n = 4 x = 34, BBCC) was higly disorganized and cytological analysis of pollen mother cells revealed chromosomes 2 n = 26 at metaphase-I. Fertile giant pollen grain formation was observed frequently in interspecific F 1 hybrid and BC 1 plants. The F 1 inter-specific plants were found to be resistant to Xcc race 1. Segregation distortion was observed in BC 1 generation for black rot resistance and different morphological traits. The At 1 g 70610 marker analysis confirmed successful introgression of black rot resistance in interspecific BC 1 population. This effort {{will go a long way}} in pyramiding gene(s) for resistance against black rot in Cole crops, especially cauliflower and cabbage for developing durable resistance, thus minimize dependency on bactericides...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{feasibility}} of visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy in quantifying parameters such as oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents of three cultivars of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and one cultivar of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica carinata A. Braun). Spectral data from 400 to 2498 nm were recorded on intact seeds {{in a total of}} 189 samples at 2 nm intervals. The content of the constituents ranged from 34. 1 % to 48. 4 % for oil, from 14. 5 % to 31. 2 % for protein and from 15. 8 to 97. 9 μmol/g for total glucosinolates. Global calibration equations using the entire Brassica database were developed by means of modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression analysis of conventional laboratory analysis values using different data pre-processing treatments. Different external validation sets were used to evaluate the accuracy of the global calibration model; in all cases the second derivative pre-processing showed the best results. In the external validation including samples of both Brassica species, the coefficient of determination (r 2) and the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference data to the standard error of prediction (RPD) were 0. 98 (6. 5), 0. 96 (4. 9) and 0. 99 (10. 0) for oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents, respectively. However, the predictive performance of the global calibration model on single species resulted in lower r 2 and RPD values for total glucosinolates. The accurate predictions provided by the NIR equations confirm that NIR technology could be very useful for the rapid quality evaluation of intact rapeseeds avoiding the need for grinding and saving time. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Defatted oilseed meals from {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.), {{and some}} Brassica species have a wellknown economic value as feed for animals, whilst their value as organic nitrogen fertilizers has been notfully explored so far. Compared to sunflower, the seed meals of Brassica species {{are reported to}} have apotentially higher capacity of nutrient supply, due to their lower content of indigestible fiber. The highcontent of glucosinolates may conversely reduce the availability of nitrogen, because of their inhibitoryeffect on nitrification processes. In this lysimetric study we compared {{the effect of the}} application of three seed meals: partially defattedmeals of sunflower and of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica carinata A. Braun), and completed defatted meal ofsunflower on the yield and N utilization of three vegetable crops (lettuce, chard and spinach), comparedto an unfertilized control and one fertilized with ammonium nitrate. Furthermore, we also investigatedthe residual effect of fertility of oilseed meal application on winter barley and fallow. Both sunflowermeals revealed a fertilization effect comparable to that of the mineral fertilizer, whilst B. carinata mealreduced the yields of chard and spinach, due to low N availability as shown by the lower N use efficiencyindex. We argue that this lower efficacy of B. carinata meal was due to the technique of the application ofthe meal, that might have produced a high concentration of glucosinolates in the soil layer explored byroots, concurrently determining a significant impact on soil biota and direct phytotoxicity phenomena. A relevant part of the N applied with fertilizers was not absorbed by the three vegetables and henceaccumulated in the soil. Despite the high values of unabsorbed soil N in the plots fertilized with oilseedmeals, nitrate leaching was lower than with ammonium nitrate. The impact on global warming potentialof fertilization with defatted oilseed meals was assessed and shown to be lower than or comparable tothe impact of the synthetic fertilizer. In particular, defatted sunflower meals caused a lower impact perhectare and total biomass, and a similar impact per fresh marketable product. Overall, our findings confirmed the high value of oilseed meals as a sustainable alternative to mineralfertilizers. However, their efficacy strongly depends on the technique of application to the soil...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in vegetable oils {{for use in}} green chemistry has stimulated research into high-erucic Brassicaceae species such as winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera) and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica carinata A. Braun). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the yield response of recently released cultivars of these species under high and low production inputs. The varieties Maplus and Hearty of B. napus, and BRK 1 of B. carinata were cultivated with autumn sowing in a large-scale field trial at the experimental farm of the University of Padova in Legnaro (NE Italy, 45 degrees 21 'N). The genotypes were compared under high and low input management systems: high input was characterised by conventional soil tillage, chemical weed control, and high N-P-K fertilization, and low input by minimum tillage, mechanical weed control, and limited N-P-K fertilization. Oilseed rape varieties had greater seed yield than BRK 1, and interactions with input level and cultivation year were significant. Maplus yielded most at high input (3. 78 vs. 3. 31 t ha(- 1) DM at low; average of two years), whereas Hearty showed no significant differences between inputs (3. 49 t ha(- 1); average of years and inputs), indicating its better adaptability to extensive agricultural management. Yield performance of BRK 1 B. carinata was very stable at varying agricultural managements, but not very high (2. 73 t ha(- 1) on average) - a fact that may limit its competitiveness with oilseed rape in autumn sowing, especially at higher latitudes. B. carinata was also more variable across the years than oilseed rape in terms of seed yield, oil content, and percentage of erucic acid. This was mainly due to the particular climatic conditions of the second year of the experiment (mild winter: hot, dry spring) which led to considerable winter elongation and pre-flowering, and later to incomplete seed filling. In these conditions, BRK 1 had both lower oil seed content (36. 7 % vs. 47. 1 %) and erucic acid (41. 3 % vs. 49. 1 %) than oilseed rapes. In general, with few exceptions, the reduction in inputs did not affect either seed oil content or the amount of erucic acid, regardless of variety and year, but seed crude proteins were reduced mainly because of N shortage.

40|$|In recent years, the use {{of cover}} crops in Mediterranean olive {{orchards}} has increased due to serious soil erosion problems and surface water contamination by herbicides. In these areas, the annual precipitation regime is strongly seasonal, with dry summers that require killing the cover crop before it competes with the trees for water. Cruciferous species are being introduced as cover crops in southern Spain, and their management by mowing could reduce {{the use of}} herbicides. However, the use of mowing as a management system requires {{an understanding of the}} phenology of these species to identify the most suitable mowing date to derive the greatest possible soil water content. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to assess the susceptibility of cruciferous species to mowing, their regrowth ability and the persistence of their residues on the soil surface after mowing, and (2) to identify the best mowing date for the cover crops in relation to the soil moisture content in the environmental conditions of southern Spain. For these purposes, the emergence, ground cover, biomass and regrowth after two mowing dates of common mustard (Sinapis alba L. subsp. mairei), rocket (Eruca vesicaria), radish (Raphanus sativus) and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica carinata) were evaluated in field trials during 2001 / 2002. In addition, during 2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004, the moisture content of soil sowed with common mustard and rocket cover crops was assessed at different mowing dates and compared with a bare soil control. Common mustard was the most favourable species for management by mowing due to its lack of regrowth after mowing. Early mowing (March 10 th) reduced soil moisture due to the regrowth of the cover crop, fast decomposition of cover residues and weed proliferation. Late mowing (April 24 th) led to little or no regrowth of the cover crops, large biomass and high persistence of cover residues, which provided effective soil ground cover, avoided the emergence of spring-summer weeds and helped retain soil moisture, reaching a similar water content to bare soil. These results suggest that cruciferous cover crops killed by mowing in late April can be used to replace no-tillage bare soil management systems to reduce the use of herbicides and preserve soil and water quality.
