40|$|In this paper, {{examination}} {{of the possibility of}} a 'double marginalization' problem existing in the Korean telecommunication industry is conducted and suggestions are made for the provision of a new scheme to eliminate this possibility by changing the pricing system for <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> calls. Based on five key economic characteristics in the Korean mobile market, a simple model for double marginalization in the telecommunication market is introduced. Evidence was found to suggest that a double marginalization problem is likely to exist within Korea's telecommunication industry as it is presently structured, and that this problem is further likely to have an adverse effect on the industry by inflating the price of <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> calls. Two alternatives are proposed to effectively remedy this double marginalization issue. It is also shown that prices of <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> calls could be lowered by changing the caller pays principle into a receiver pays principle. Korea Double marginalization Mobile...|$|E

40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that mobile network operators are monopolists when {{they set the}} termination rate for the calls made to their own network. Since the mobile-to-fixed termination rates are usually regulated at cost and the fixed network operator has the obligation to terminate the incoming calls, therefore the fixed provider can neither threaten to raise the mobile-to-fixed termination charge, nor threaten to refuse to terminate the call. Hence, mobile network operators can fix high <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> termination rates. We propose a policy to overcome this termination bottleneck imposing reciprocity between the mobile-to-fixed and <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> termination rates and relaxing the interconnection obligation. First, we consider a benchmark where mobile-tofixed termination rates are regulated at cost and fixed and mobile network operators negotiate the <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> termination rate. We show that fixedto-mobile termination rates depend negatively on the MTM termination rate and positively on the intensity of competition in the mobile sector.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} worldwide {{increase in}} mobile communication {{that has led}} to more than 4 billion users has {{over the last few years}} been accompanied in wealthy countries by a significant decline in fixed network subscriptions. Such <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> substitution (FMS) is at the center of this literature survey. Theoretical models explaining FMS are scarce and are inconclusive regarding the balance between substitution and complementarity of the fixed and mobile sectors. Empirical explanations hinge on the interaction of positive cross-elasticities of demand and reductions in mobile relative to fixed communications prices. FMS is also supported by relative declines in mobile network costs, network effects in demand and quality improvements of mobile services. The policy consequences of FMS stem from the potential reductions in market power of operators in fixed-line markets and from the ability of mobile operators to enable universal service. The survey reveals ample opportunity for further empirical and theoretical research in the area of FMS. <b>Fixed-to-mobile</b> substitution Network effects Cross-price elasticity...|$|E

Competition is often relaxed by choosing a low mobile-to-mobile termination charge.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom that mobile operators are able to act as monopolists in pricing call termination on their networks has recently been challenged by Hutchison 3 G’s entry into European mobile markets. The European Commission’s electronic communications regime allows national regulatory authorities to regulate mobile termination rates if an operator is found to possess “significant market power”. This requires that the mobile operator not be constrained by the "countervailing buyer power" of incumbents. The claim that incumbent operators possess countervailing buyer power has been repeatedly dismissed because of their obligation to interconnect with other networks. This conclusion is erroneous.

40|$|Without regulation, {{market power}} in mobile {{termination}} {{is likely to}} result in mobile termination rates (MTRs) in excess of costs and cross-subsidised prices for mobile subscription/handsets. Mobile network operators (MNOs) argue that subsidisation is efficient, being justified by, inter alia, a network externality on new mobile subscriptions. However, especially in mature markets, the argument here is that MNOs will tend to set MTRs inefficiently high and subscription prices will be driven inefficiently low. Regulation is necessary to prevent these inefficiencies. Further, other externalities have different implications [...] e. g., the mobile call-receipt externality suggests a subsidy to mobile termination. The conclusion is that on balance {{and in the absence of}} detailed empirical estimation of the size of a multitude of possible types of externality, it is likely to be efficient to set MTRs to cost in markets with high penetration.

Because both expansion and contraction could be relevant in the future, this paper suggests an optional approach based on the wholesale price formula p=min{FL-LRAIC, Retail-Minus} with an optional replacement of per-minute charges by capacity-based access charges (CBC).

However, a suitable channel model for vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications is difficult to build due to the dynamic communication environment.

Each of multiple scatterers in the model is moving with a random velocity in a random direction. Based on the geometrical propagation model, a generalized 3 D reference model for narrowband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) V 2 V multipath fading channels is developed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} mobile network competition on the prices of <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> calls. Because fixed line customers cannot, in general, distinguish {{the identity of a}} specific mobile network, these networks have market power when setting termination charges for calls from fixed lines. We show that: (1) unregulated mobile termination charges will result in higher than monopoly call prices; (2) the regulation of termination charges and prices downward will affect mobile subscription rates and may lower these rates; and (3) regulation of any mobile carrier’s termination charges can reduce fixed to mobile prices but will result in an increase in unregulated carriers’ termination charges. When fixed line consumers can distinguish between the different mobile networks they are calling, fixed to mobile call prices will fall relative to their level under customer ignorance. Direct mobile charging for termination also exerts downward pressure on the total fixed to mobile call price. A low cost method of lowering fixed to mobile charges would be to facilitate the identification of carriers by consumers and to restructure billing so that mobile networks are able to directly charge fixed line consumers for termination services...|$|E
40|$|Handset {{subsidies}} are prominent in many mobile markets, {{and are often}} justified {{on the basis of}} network externalities arising from new subscribers joining with a benefit to existing subscribers in addition to their private valuation. An associated argument is that a tax on termination to fund these subsidies is justifiable. However, the external benefits from new subscriptions are likely to be minimal in the prevailing circumstances of saturation where there is not even the prima facie basis for mounting a case for subsidies. Benefits to other than new subscribers could be captured by personalised subsidies to new subscription and reciprocities in calling arrangements. Further, high termination charges will lead to fewer calls to mobiles, reducing the value of, and willingness-to-pay for, mobile subscription. Empirical evidence that handset {{subsidies are}} increasingly concentrated on discouraging churn and on encouraging migration to 3 G mobile networks [...] rather than attraction of first-time subscribers [...] suggests that mobile subscription subsidies are not targeted at internalising various forms of externality, and instead are being used as a competitive tool.

The sudden growth in mobile telephony market revealed regulatory needs in particular services. The crucial service that regulators mainly focus was Mobile Termination service since it was identified that operators have monopoly power in termination service. By this identification, a debate on whether mobile termination rates need to be regulated arose. This master thesis exemines the debate in detail. Some argue that mobile termination rates are high and high termination rates may cause some market failures. To understand whether mobile termination rates are high, the incentives of the mobile operator: are discussed. Mobile operators have different incentives to set high termination charges for <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> (FTM) and mobile-to-mobile (MTM) calls. Therefore, it is plausible to examine termination issue separately in FTM and MTM markets. The thesis illustrates that while FTM termination rates need to the regulated since incentives are strong, MTM termination charges {{are less likely to be}} regulated. However, termination charges are high not only for FTM, but they are also high for MTM in many countries. Therefore, countries regulate termination rates in both FTM and MTM markets.

40|$|Long-term {{evolution}} (LTE) standard {{has been}} successfully stabilized, and launched in several areas. However, the required channel capacity {{is expected to increase}} significantly as the explosively increasing number of smart-phone users implies. Hence, this is already the time for leading researchers to concentrate on a new multiple access scheme in wireless communications to satisfy the channel capacity that those smart users will want in the not-too-distant future. The diversity and multiplexing in a new domain - polarization domain - can be a strong candidate for the solution to that problem in future wireless communication systems. This research contributes largely to the comprehensive understanding of polarized wireless channels and a new multiple access scheme in the polarization domain - polarization division multiple access (PDMA). The thesis consists of three streams: 1) a novel geometrical theory and models for <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> (F 2 M) and mobile-to-mobile (M 2 M) polarized wireless channels; 2) a new wireless body area network (BAN) polarized channel modeling; and 3) a novel PDMA scheme. The proposed geometrical theory and models reveal the origin and mechanism of channel depolarization with excellent agreement with empirical data in terms of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), which is the principal measure of channel depolarization. Further, a novel PDMA scheme utilizing polarization-filtering detection and collaborative transmitter-receiver-polarization (Tx-Rx-polarization) adjustment, is designed considering cellular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The novel PDMA scheme has large potential to be utilized with the conventional time, frequency, and code division multiple access (TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA); and spatial multiplexing for next-generation wireless communication systems.

40|$|Non-stationarity of vehicle-to-vehicle {{channels}} {{is one of}} the {{key elements}} that has to be taken into account for accurate channel modeling. The time-variance and its dual – the frequency selectivity – leads to non-stationarity. These can be assessed by both the temporal autocorrelation function and the Doppler spectrum, respectively. For <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> channels closed-form solutions for autocorrelation functions and Doppler spectra are well known. For vehicle-to-vehicle channels closed- form solutions exist, if uncorrelated double-bounce scattering is assumed. For time-variant, delay-dependent, correlated single- bounce scattering expressions are yet to be found. This contribu- tion addresses the mentioned problem. Specifically, the propor- tionality between the Doppler probability density function (pdf) and Doppler power spectrum in time-varying scenarios for non- stationary, uncorrelated scattering is demonstrated. The latter also implies a proportionality between the characteristic function and the corresponding autocorrelation function; these functions are the Fourier transforms of the Doppler pdf and Doppler power spectrum, respectively. It is shown that time-varying characteristic functions and Doppler pdfs for general vehicle-to- vehicle scenarios can be derived in prolate spheroidal coordinates. The investigation of the Doppler frequency in these coordinates allows us deriving expressions of the maximum and minimum frequencies of the Doppler pdf in the vicinity of line-of-sight. Several vehicular scenarios of interest are investigated and closed- form solutions for the Doppler pdf and characteristic function are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the obtained expressions generalize well the known closed-form results for stationary channels. This further permits deriving some time- variant statistical channel parameters like mean Doppler and Doppler spread. These parameters are particularly important when designing a Wiener filter or estimating propagation channel characteristics for highly time-variant vehicle-to-vehicle channels...|$|E
40|$|When {{a person}} uses the {{traditional}} wireline telephone network to call another person {{on his cell}} phone, the fixed network must transfer the call to the mobile network to which the recipient subscribes. The fixed network provides originating access for the call, and the mobile network provides terminating access. This paper provides an economic analysis of the regulation of <b>fixed-to-mobile</b> termination rates. Mobile party pays (2 ̆ 2 MPP 2 ̆ 2) creates better incentives than calling party pays (2 ̆ 2 CPP 2 ̆ 2) for mobile network operators to place downward pressure on termination rates. Cellular telephone use in the United States and Canada has continued to increase at a significant pace despite the MPP regime and now far exceeds mobile telephone use in countries with CPP regimes. Multiple factors, including substitution possibilities for the callers of mobile subscribers, constrain the market power of mobile operators in setting mobile termination rates under CPP regimes. It is unrealistic for regulators to attempt to set mobile rates, including termination rates, at marginal cost. If large fixed network costs and customer acquisition costs must be recovered from variable charges, then marginal-cost-based pricing is not feasible. Also, the value to callers {{of being able to}} reach mobile subscribers justifies mobile termination charges that exceed marginal cost because of network externalities in mobile telecommunications. Finally, mobile termination rates that exceed marginal cost (or its proxy, long-run average incremental cost) are consistent with Ramsey (quasi-efficient) pricing. To the extent that high termination rates are a problem in countries that have embraced CPP, it is because customers are poorly informed of the charges they pay for their terminating calls. Consumer education would solve the potential market failure without the need to impose price regulation on otherwise competitive markets...|$|E
