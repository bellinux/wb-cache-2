500|$|In {{the last}} few pages of the book, in which Olivero prepares for his death and petrification, Read {{describes}} Olivero's final thoughts in a form adapted from Plato's Phaedo, but in an almost mirror image. Socrates, whose thoughts on the afterlife Plato was describing, argued that death was the ideal home of the soul, but Olivero longs for his body {{to be free from}} the torments of the soul, {{to become part of the}} crystalline solidity of the universe. Olivero regards life, not death, as the destroyer, [...] "for it [...] disrupts the harmony of inorganic matter". Socrates' suggestion, towards the end of the Phaedo, that our own world <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many, each a hollow in the earth connected by underground rivers, is a strikingly similar image to the subterranean land of the Green people that Read describes.

2500|$|Artist Jermaine Rogers {{has often}} used {{his version of}} the Deros in his many posters used to {{advertise}} rock music concerts. Rogers has approached the subject of the Deros with an ambiguity that some have taken as proof that he truly believes in these beings. Starting in 1994, Rogers began including images of his Deros in several poster advertisements for rock and roll concerts. The Deros as depicted by Rogers are huge, 6 foot (2.8 meters) tall teddy bear-like beings, with leering grimaces and bulging red eyes. The artist has stated that this description <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the many [...] "masks" [...] the Deros are using to disguise themselves in their interactions with surface dwellers. Rogers has taken the general premise of the Deros and combined it with ancient legend and myth, fringe psychology, and his own personal interpretation. In Roger's telling, the subterranean world of the Deros is alive with strife, rebellion, and intrigue, wherein beings bred by Dero overlords (known as [...] "Veil") have secretly conspired against them to foster their downfall. While Rogers discusses Shaver quite frequently, he nonetheless believes that Shaver's version of the story was overly exaggerated and that he was an unwitting pawn in the Deros plot.|$|E

2500|$|Notwithstanding {{the changes}} brought {{about in the}} course of time, Vespers still remains the great and {{important}} Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the sacrificium vespertinum of the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the Vigil, so also {{is the end of the}} day by Vespers. It terminates, as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the Gospel, or canticum evangelii, which, for Vespers, is always the [...] "Magnificat". This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the [...] "Magnificat" [...] is sung at Lauds (cf. Cabrol in [...] "Dict. d'arch. et de liturgie", s.v. Cantiques évangéliques). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote antiquity <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, [...] "Lucis Creator optime", on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon; the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, on Friday, to the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.|$|E
