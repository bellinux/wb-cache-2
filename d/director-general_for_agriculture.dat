500|$|The most {{pressing}} {{concern of the}} Luxembourgish government was that of food supply. [...] The war had made importation of food an impossibility, {{and the needs of}} the German occupiers inevitably came before those of the Luxembourgish people. [...] To slow the food supply's diminishment, Michel Welter, the <b>Director-General</b> <b>for</b> both <b>agriculture</b> and commerce, banned the export of food from Luxembourg. [...] Furthermore, the government introduced rationing and price controls to counteract the soaring demand and to make food more affordable for poorer Luxembourgers. [...] However, the measures did not have the desired effect. [...] Increasing numbers of Luxembourgers turned to the black market, and, to the consternation of the Luxembourgish government, the German army of occupation seemed to do little to help. [...] Moreover, the government accused Germany of aiding the development of the black market by refusing to enforce regulations, and even of smuggling goods themselves.|$|R
