5|$|SuperSpeed (SS) adds two {{additional}} pairs of shielded twisted wire (and new, mostly compatible expanded connectors). These {{are dedicated to}} full-duplex SuperSpeed operation. The <b>half-duplex</b> lines are still used for configuration.|$|E
5|$|The new SuperSpeed mode {{provides}} a {{data signaling rate}} of 5.0Gbit/s. However, due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding, the payload throughput is actually 4Gbit/s, and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve only around 3.2Gbit/s (0.4GB/s or 400MB/s). However, this should increase with future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are <b>half-duplex,</b> arbitrated by the host.|$|E
5|$|USB is {{a serial}} bus, using four {{shielded}} wires for the USB2.0 variant: two for power (VBUS and GND), and two for differential data signals (labelled as D+ and D− in pinouts). Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) encoding scheme {{is used for}} transferring data, with a sync field to synchronize the host and receiver clocks. D+ and D− signals are transmitted on a differential pair, providing <b>half-duplex</b> data transfers for USB2.0. Mini and micro connectors have their GND connections moved from pin #4 to pin #5, while their pin #4 serves as an ID pin for the On-The-Go host/client identification.|$|E
25|$|Some {{variants}} like Multi I/O SPI and three-wire serial buses defined {{below are}} <b>half-duplex.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{full-duplex}} capability makes SPI {{very simple}} and efficient for single master/single slave applications. Some devices use the full-duplex mode to implement an efficient, swift data stream for {{applications such as}} digital audio, digital signal processing, or telecommunications channels, but most off-the-shelf chips stick to <b>half-duplex</b> request/response protocols.|$|E
25|$|We {{consider}} a wireless relay system {{that consists of}} source, relay and destination nodes. It is assumed that the channel is in a <b>half-duplex,</b> orthogonal and amplify-and-forward relaying mode. Differently to the conventional direct transmission system, we exploit a time division relaying function where this system can deliver information with two temporal phases.|$|E
25|$|Microwire, often spelled μWire, is {{essentially}} a predecessor of SPI and a trademark of National Semiconductor. It's a strict subset of SPI: <b>half-duplex,</b> and using SPI mode 0. Microwire chips tend to need slower clock rates than newer SPI versions; perhaps 2MHz vs. 20MHz. Some Microwire chips also support a three-wire mode.|$|E
25|$|Many Ethernet {{adapters}} {{and switch}} ports support multiple speeds, using autonegotiation {{to set the}} speed and duplex for the best values supported by both connected devices. While this can practically be relied on for ports supporting twisted-pair cabling, only few optical-fiber ports support multiple speeds. If auto-negotiation fails, some multiple-speed devices sense the speed used by their partner, but will assume <b>half-duplex.</b> A 10/100Ethernet port supports 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. A 10/100/1000Ethernet port supports 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T. A 10GBASE-T port usually supports 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T.|$|E
25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low noise floor and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of <b>half-duplex</b> FM repeater use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of the cell phone in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|E
500|$|Low-speed (LS) and Full-speed (FS) modes use {{a single}} data pair, {{labelled}} D+ and D−, in <b>half-duplex.</b> Transmitted signal levels are [...] for logical low, and [...] for logical high level. The signal lines are not terminated.|$|E
2500|$|... 1986: An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} ALDL protocol appears which communicates at 8192 bit/s with <b>half-duplex</b> UART signaling. This protocol is defined in GM XDE-5024B.|$|E
2500|$|Because the {{full-duplex}} {{nature of}} SPI is rarely used, an extension uses both data pins in a <b>half-duplex</b> configuration to send two bits per clock cycle. [...] Typically a command byte is sent requesting a response in dual mode, {{after which the}} MOSI line becomes SIO0 (serial I/O 0) and carries even bits, while the MISO line becomes SIO1 and carries odd bits. [...] Data is still transmitted msbit-first, but SIO1 carries bits 7, 5, 3 and 1 of each byte, while SIO0 carries bits 6, 4, 2 and 0.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{keyboard}} was mechanically connected {{directly with the}} printer mechanism, keyboard character inputs were immediately typed by the printer mechanism, behavior called <b>half-duplex</b> {{by most of the}} computer industry. [...] However, IBM insisted on calling this behavior full duplex, causing much confusion. [...] If the computer system in turn echoed the typed input, having been configured to expect a full-duplex terminal, the echoed output would look something like tthhiiss. [...] A further discussion of this terminology {{can be seen in the}} article on terminal emulation and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|A <b>half-duplex</b> {{system could}} be {{upgraded}} {{in the field to}} a duplex system by adding one IBM 2067-2 processor and the third IBM 2365-12 Processor Storage, unless the <b>half-duplex</b> system already had three or more. The <b>half-duplex</b> and duplex configurations were called the IBM System/360 model 67-2.|$|E
50|$|All Gigabit Ethernet {{variants}} use a star topology. Initially, <b>half-duplex</b> mode {{was included}} in the standard but has been abandoned since. Very few devices support gigabit speed in <b>half-duplex.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{computer-based}} {{systems of}} the 1960s and 1970s required full-duplex facilities, even for <b>half-duplex</b> operation, since their poll-and-response schemes could not tolerate the slight delays in reversing the direction of transmission in a <b>half-duplex</b> line.|$|E
50|$|Full {{break-in}} or QSK {{operation is}} a technique and protocol used on radiotelegraph <b>half-duplex</b> channels that closely approximates the feeling of operating on a full-duplex channel. e.g. It appears to the QSK operators <b>half-duplex</b> operators that both directions can be used simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Some Spacewire {{users are}} experimenting with <b>half-duplex</b> versions.The general scheme is that <b>half-duplex</b> uses one {{transmission}} channel rather than two. In space, this is useful because the weight of wires is half as much. Controllers would reverse the link after sending an end-of-packet character. The scheme is most effective in the self-clocking electrical systems, such as Spacewire. In the high speed optical slices, <b>half-duplex</b> throughput would be limited by the synchronization time of the phase locked loops used to recover the bit clock.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst local echo {{and remote}} echo are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "half-duplex" [...] and [...] "full-duplex", those latter appellations are strictly incorrect, and are misleading (see duplex for their correct meanings). Whilst local echo is often used with <b>half-duplex</b> transmission, so that bandwidth is not wasted upon remotely echoing data from the remote end of the communications channel, it {{is not the same as}} <b>half-duplex</b> transmission. A full-duplex communications channel can still employ local echo, and a <b>half-duplex</b> channel can still (albeit wastefully) employ remote echo, or no echo at all.|$|E

50|$|If a {{duplex channel}} can be {{operated}} {{only one way}} at a time it is styled a <b>half-duplex</b> channel and <b>half-duplex</b> protocols must be used. If a duplex channel can be shared and operated in both directions simultaneously it is styled a full-duplex channel and full-duplex protocols may be used.|$|E
50|$|SDLC {{operates}} independently on each communications link, and {{can operate}} on point-to-pointmultipointor loop facilities, on switched or dedicated, two-wire or four-wire circuits, and with full-duplex and <b>half-duplex</b> operation.A unique characteristic of SDLC {{is its ability}} to mix <b>half-duplex</b> secondary stations with full-duplex primary stations on four-wire circuits, thus reducing the cost of dedicated facilities.|$|E

50|$|All {{these three}} {{standards}} define both full-duplex and <b>half-duplex</b> communication. However, <b>half-duplex</b> operation for gigabit speed isn't supported by any existing hardware. Higher speed standards, 2.5GBASE-T up to 40GBASE-T running at 2.5 to 40 Gbit/s, consequently define only full-duplex point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches, and don't support the traditional shared-medium CSMA/CD operation.|$|E

50|$|Two-way {{alternating}} communications {{are sometimes}} called <b>half-duplex,</b> {{but there may}} be a fine distinction that two-way alternating communications is a property of the communication protocol used between the endpoints, while the underlying communications medium may support either two-way alternating or two-way simultaneous communications. When the medium is shared for transmitting and receiving, it can only support two-way alternating protocols, and the medium may be called physically <b>half-duplex.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{end result}} is a {{connection}} that is working but performs extremely poorly because of the duplex mismatch. Symptoms of a duplex mismatch are connections that seem to work fine with a ping command, but [...] "lock up" [...] easily with very low throughput on data transfers; the effective data transfer rate {{is likely to be}} asymmetrical, performing much worse in the <b>half-duplex</b> to full-duplex direction than the other. In normal <b>half-duplex</b> operations late collisions do not occur. However, in a duplex mismatch the collisions seen on the <b>half-duplex</b> side of the link are often late collisions. The full-duplex side usually will register frame check sequence errors, or runt frames. Viewing these standard Ethernet statistics can help diagnose the problem.|$|E
