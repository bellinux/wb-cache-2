40|$|I {{report on}} the social and {{breeding}} biology of four bee-eater species in Thailand. Little <b>Green</b> <b>Bee-eaters</b> (Merops orientalis) breed cooperatively in clusters of overlapping territories. Cooperative breeding units have one to two helpers that join the breeding pair only after incubation has begun. Nests rarely are left unguarded due to threats of predation and possible intraspecific brood parasitism. Males also guard their mates against extrapair copulations. The Blue-tailed Bee-eater (M Philippinus) breeds cooperatively and has a complex social system, with evidence suggestive of intraspecific brood parasitism and extrapair copulation. I provide evidence that the Bay-headed Bee-eater (M Leschenaulti) breeds cooperatively and report observations of noncooperative breeding at one nest in the Blue-bearded Bee-eater (Nyctyornis athertoni) ...|$|R
5000|$|There are [...] "69 {{species of}} mammal, 327 species of birds, 7 species of reptile, 493 {{species of plants}} and 92 species of fish". Planning for the {{conservation}} and management of wildlife in Gambela Park was focused on protecting three endangered species: the African elephant, Nile lechwe and shoebill stork. Among the mammal species reported to be living here are the Cape buffalo, Masai lion, leopard, Sudan cheetah, Nubian giraffe, roan antelope, tiang, Lelwel hartebeest, olive baboon, and guereza monkey, as well as hyena, buffalo, sable antelope, hippopotamus, Kafue lechwe, zebra, greater kudu, bushbuck, oribi, reedbuck and waterbuck.

25|$|A {{study on}} the little <b>green</b> <b>bee-eater</b> {{suggests}} that these birds {{may be able to}} see {{from the point of view}} of a predator. The brown-necked raven has been observed hunting lizards in complex cooperation with other ravens, demonstrating an apparent understanding of prey behavior. The California scrub jay hides caches of food and will later re-hide food if it was watched by another bird the first time, but only if the bird hiding the food has itself stolen food before from a cache. Such an ability to see from the point of view of another individual had previously been attributed only to the great apes and sometimes elephants. Such abilities form the basis for empathy.|$|E
40|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} (CB) {{is found}} in a wide diversity of avian lineages and can be explained at several levels of analysis. After a brief introduction to the theory explaining CB, I take an historical approach to examine CB evolution in the bee-eaters (Family Meropidae). Parsimony analyses of plumage color and shape characters yielded a number of phylogenetic hypotheses. The best supported phylogenies are six fully resolved trees from three analyses and a strict consensus tree from another analysis. These trees are {{used to examine the}} possible patterns of evolution in CB and how transition correspond to transitions in other ecological and behavioral traits. Bee-eaters were also studied in Thailand. Little <b>green</b> <b>bee-eaters,</b> Merops orientalis, breed cooperatively and predation pressure may be high in this species. Blue-tailed bee-eaters, M. philippinus, breed cooperatively in dense colonies and show signs of potential extra-pair copulation and intraspecific brood parasitism. Observations of the bay-headed bee-eater, M. leschenaulti, and the blue-bearded bee-eater, Nyctyornis athertoni, document CB in the former and support non-CB designation for the latter. Cooperative breeding is either primitive in bee-eaters or evolved early in the family. Reversals to non-CB occurred in one to three lineages. Transitions in breeding systems are not generally correlated with the transitions in nesting requirements, habitat utilization, migratory behavior, or diet. Evidence suggests correlated evolution between CB and both foraging mode (weak evidence) and social systems (stronger support). This study does not support any single hypothesis for the adaptive basis of CB across the family. Social system evolutionary patterns do suggest the importance of kin selection in several lineages. Lack of change in breeding systems, given diverse ecological and behavioral circumstances, means either cooperative breeding is malleable (selectively advantageous in a variety of ecological conditions) or represents phylogenetic inertia. A final analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic confidence indices fail to express the degree to which characters in a matrix are non-conflicting and congruent (for a given level of noise) and show only limited abilities to distinguish among probabilities of analyses making type II errors...|$|R
