He briefly joined the practice squad of the Ottawa Renegades, but later re-signed with the Argonauts to their own practice squad.|$|E

Both Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were included, despite their ongoing doping case, where the Pakistan Cricket Board had first banned them before a tribunal reprieved the two. In a twist of fate, both players were replaced by Mohammad Sami and Yasir Arafat on 1 March due to <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> elbow injuries respectively.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Forty-five {{young adult}} males were given 30 trials of Isometric <b>knee</b> {{extension}} <b>and</b> 30 trials of isometric knee flexion. Each trial {{consisted of a}} maximum of three second exertion followed by a 10 second intertrial rest interval. Subjects were ranked {{on the basis of}} the mean of the first three trials of <b>knee</b> extension <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexion <b>and</b> divided into three groups of 15 subjects each representing highs middle, and low levels of strength. A two by three by four factorial analysis of variance suggested that: (a) no significant difference existed between responses of <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexors; (b) no significant difference existed between responses of <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexors when considered by levels of strength; and (c) a significant difference existed between responses of <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexors when considered by trial intervals...|$|R

Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{months of}} rehabilitation {{on his left}} <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> helping the U.S. Olympic team win a {{gold medal at the}} 2008 Olympics, in which he led the team in scoring, Wade returned to the starting lineup {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five blocked shots in a game since Alvan Adams did so in the 1976–77 season. With a healthy Wade leading the league in scoring and the Heat making a push for a playoff position, Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star game appearance.|$|E
5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his right <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required him to have yet another operation on his right knee. After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E

With Orr, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1970 and 1972, and lost in the 1974 Final. In both victories, Orr scored the clinching goal and was named the playoff MVP. In the final achievement of his career, he was the MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup international hockey tournament. In 1976, Orr left Boston {{as a free agent}} to join the Black Hawks, but repeated injuries had effectively destroyed his left <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> he retired in 1978 at age 30.|$|E

At age 32, West averaged 27.9points, 4.6rebounds and 9.5assists, and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured his <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks. The Milwaukee Bucks featured freshly crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson.|$|E

Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E
