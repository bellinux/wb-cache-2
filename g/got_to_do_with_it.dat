In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving the right to sue the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>It</b> helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E
