A large fund, with <b>investment</b> duration <b>restrictions</b> and limited GP’s profit sharing, minimizes agency conflicts but may force the GP to offer LPs positive rents, even if the GP has all the bargaining power. When rents are sufficiently large, the GP trades off efficiency for reduced rents by establishing a small fund if projects have moderate payoff potential or by establishing a large fund with no <b>investment</b> duration <b>restrictions</b> if projects have high payoff potential...|$|R

We advocate {{the idea that}} investments in intangibles allow a company to be better off, even if the markets go down. The hypothesis put forward in this article was tested on a sample of more than 300 companies which operate in developed and emerging European markets, and belong to traditional and innovative industries. The application of statistical tools showed a robust significant link between the companies’ investment decisions and their performance {{before and during the}} crisis.

40|$|This study employs {{single and}} {{multiple}} variance ratio tests to reexamine the weak-form efficient market hypothesis (EMH) of A- and B-shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in Chinese stock market. The study also examines {{the influence of}} the release of <b>investment</b> <b>restriction</b> of B-share markets on market efficiency. For the whole sample period, the weak-form EMH is only supported for Shanghai A-shares, and is not supported for the remaining shares. For the sub-sample period, the Shenzhen A-share and B-shares of both exchanges being rejected for the weak-form EMH in the earlier sample period are supported following the regulatory change. Rolling multiple variance ratio test statistic values provide additional evidence of weak-form EMH. The improvement of market efficiency {{can be explained by the}} increased liquidity and maturity accompanying deregulation and liberalization.

40|$|The {{high value}} of the {{implicit}} option to choose a retirement date at which interest rates are particularly high and life annuities relatively cheap, leads to the possibility to introduce regret aversion in the retirement investment decision of defined contribution plan participants. As a remedy for regret aversion in retirement investment decisions, this paper develops and prices a lookback option on a life annuity contract. We determine a closed-form option value under the restriction that the option holder invests risklessly during the time to maturity of the option and without the guarantee that the exact amount of retirement wealth is converted into a life annuity at retirement. Thereafter the <b>investment</b> <b>restriction</b> is relaxed and the guarantee of exact conversion is imposed and the option is priced via Monte Carlo simulations in an economic environment with a stochastic discount factor. Option price sensitivities are determined via the pricing of alternative options. We find {{that the price of}} a lookback option, with a maturity of three years, amounts to 8 %- 9 % of the wealth at the option issuance date. The option price is highly sensitive to the exercise price of the option, i. e. Â pricing alternative options (e. g. Â Asian) substantially lowers the price. Time to maturity and interest rate volatility are other important option price drivers. Asset allocation decisions and initial interest rates hardly affect the option price. ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{ambition}} of this thesis is {{the analysis of}} factors determining Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows with special focus on evaluating {{of the role of}} Chinese institutional framework in this process. Empirical part of the thesis employs random effects method as the main tool for estimation of FDI gravity model. The data set consists of observations of 189 source countries over the 1995 - 2011 period. The results suggest relatively low sensitivity of the source countries to the institutional factors. Besides the traditional FDI determinants such as gravity variables or cultural ties, the quality of property rights protection, tax burden imposed by government, and <b>investment</b> flow <b>restrictions</b> are found out to be important factors of Chinese FDI inflows.

40|$|This study {{categorized}} {{the capital}} investors of mega solar projects (solar power generation projects of 1 MW or larger), whose market is vitalized {{due to the}} feed-in tariff (FIT), into outside and inside of regions. The result showed that about 60 % of the currently operating mega solar plants (as of May, 2014) had investors from outside of the region, such as major companies. Since the FIT system assures income for the investors, the high ratio of outside investors means that the citizens' electricity charges in the region flow out to other regions and have little contribution to the local economies.

40|$|New Source Review (NSR) is a Clean Air Act {{regulation}} that requires electric utilities to meet emission standards when making modifications to existing power plants.

Prior to the 2000 presidential election, investors expected Bush to have a narrower interpretation of NSR than Gore. Therefore, we use changes in stock prices to estimate the effect on profits of differences in NSR policy. Our results indicate that investors expected the average boiler to be $ 38 million more valuable under the Bush administration. Over the boilers' lifetimes, the additional utilization will have increased emissions by 19 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 5. 9 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 980 million tons of carbon dioxide, relative to natural gas generation...|$|R

50|$|For businesses, the Social Credit System {{is meant}} {{to serve as a}} market {{regulation}} mechanism. The goal is to establish a self-enforcing regulatory regime fueled by big data in which businesses exercise “self-restraint” (企业自我约束). The basic idea is that with a functional credit system in place, companies will comply with government policies and regulations to avoid having their scores lowered. As currently envisioned, companies with good credit scores will enjoy benefits such as good credit conditions, lower tax rates, and more investment opportunities. Companies with bad credit scores will potentially face unfavorable conditions for new loans, higher tax rates, <b>investment</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and lower chances to participate in publicly funded projects. Government plans also envision real-time monitoring of a business’s activities. In that case, infractions {{on the part of a}} business could result in a lowered score almost instantly. However, whether this will actually happen depends on the future implementation of the system as well as on the availability of technology needed for this kind of monitoring.|$|E

In the past, Venezuela placed tough restrictions upon the entry and operation of foreign <b>investment.</b> These <b>restrictions</b> were made possible as long as petroleum prices remained high and the country had access to cheap international bank loans. The debt crisis in the 1980 s, a drop in commodity prices, {{and a decrease in}} international bank loans once again made FDI an attractive source of foreign capital. In order to attract greater FDI inflows, Venezuela began to liberalize its foreign investment laws in the mid- 1980 s. Despite these changes, FDI inflows into Venezuela have been erratic. This paper then discusses some of the adjustments Venezuela will have to make in order to attract greater foreign investment inflows, and ends with an examination of how the country can maximize FDI's contribution to its economic development...|$|R
