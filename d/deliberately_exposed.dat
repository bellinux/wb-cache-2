5|$|Corporal Daniel Keighran of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment {{was awarded}} the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November 2012 for actions in the Battle of Derapet (Oruzgan province, Afghanistan) in August 2010.

He is the third recipient, and the first non-Special Forces recipient, of the award.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Ambrosio Guillen (1929–1953) was posthumously {{awarded the}} Medal of Honor {{two days before}} the Armistice. He was {{responsible}} for turning an overwhelming enemy attack into a disorderly retreat. Guillen, who was assigned to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), participated in the defense of an outpost forward of the main line of resistance on July 25, 1953. He maneuvered his platoon over unfamiliar terrain in the face of hostile fire and placed his men in fighting positions. With his unit pinned down when the outpost was attacked under cover of darkness by an estimated force of two enemy battalions supported by mortar and artillery fire, he <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> himself to the heavy barrage and attacks to direct his men in defending their positions and personally supervise the treatment and evacuation of the wounded. Inspired by his leadership, the platoon quickly rallied and engaged the enemy force in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Although critically wounded {{during the course of the}} battle, Staff Sergeant Guillen refused medical aid and continued to direct his men throughout the remainder of the engagement until the enemy attack into a disorderly retreat.|$|E

On the contrary, the name would reasonably expect the underwriter to exercise due skill and care to prevent him from suffering losses.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{chickenpox}} {{is usually}} more severe in adults {{than it is}} in children, some parents <b>deliberately</b> <b>expose</b> their children to the virus, sometimes by taking them to [...] "chickenpox parties". Doctors counter that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, rather than getting the disease, which can be fatal.|$|R
25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation {{in as much as}} it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|E
25|$|In August 1896 Dr. HD. Hawks, a {{graduate}} of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> a finger to an x-ray tube {{over a period of}} time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using {{artificial}} means to try to accelerate the natural aging process. In Ancient Rome a smoke chamber known as a fumarium was used to enhance the flavor of wine through artificial aging. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color just like aged wine. Modern winemaking techniques like micro-oxygenation can have the side effect of artificially aging the wine. In the production of Madeira and rancio wines, the wines are <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> to excessive temperatures to accelerate the maturation of the wine. Other techniques used to artificially age wine (with inconclusive results on their effectiveness) include shaking the wine, exposing it to radiation, magnetism or ultra-sonic waves. More recently, experiments with artificial aging through high-voltage electricity have produced results above the remaining techniques, as assessed by a panel of wine tasters.|$|E
50|$|In Western countries, toplessness {{in public}} often generates media coverage, leading some female {{political}} demonstrators to <b>deliberately</b> <b>expose</b> their breasts in public to draw {{media and public}} attention to their cause.

50|$|AppliancesBritish law (the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989) {{requires}} that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger.

The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to conciliate James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond, who had regained much of his family's former influence, St Leger gave him command of the Irish forces {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1544.

It emerged that Walter had written the letter, although he insisted that an associate of his called Cantwell had been responsible.|$|R
500|$|Initially Steinitz {{played in}} the all-out attacking style of contemporaries like Anderssen, and then changed to the {{positional}} style with which he dominated competitive chess in the 1870s and 1880s. Max Euwe wrote, [...] "Steinitz aimed at positions with clear-cut features, to which his theory was best applicable." [...] However, he retained his capacity for brilliant attacks right {{to the end of}} his career; for example in the 1895 Hastings tournament (when he was 59) he beat von Bardeleben in a [...] in which in the closing stages Steinitz <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> all his pieces to attack simultaneously (except his king, of course).

2500|$|At {{various times}} between September 1939 and April 1945, many {{experiments}} were conducted at Sachsenhausen, Natzweiler, and other camps {{to investigate the}} most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas.

5000|$|However, Widukind De Ridder {{has argued}} that {{scholars}} who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the Young Hegelians as expressions of his own alleged Hegelianism are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that The Ego and Its Own is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposing</b> its outwornness as a system of thought, and that Stirner's notions of [...] "ownness" [...] and [...] "egoism" [...] were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.|$|R

2500|$|The {{actions for}} which Donaldson's Victoria Cross for Australia were awarded {{took place on}} 2 September 2008. Patrolling with Afghan and US forces, they were ambushed by a well-prepared and larger Taliban force. The ambush began with {{sustained}} machine gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire, causing several casualties. Donaldson <b>deliberately</b> <b>exposed</b> himself to fire from the Taliban fighters in order to draw their {{attention away from the}} casualties, allowing them to be moved to cover. When the patrol attempted to withdraw, the number of casualties was such that the unwounded personnel (including Donaldson) had to make their way on foot, beside their vehicles, as the casualties filled the vehicles. [...] As they set off, it was realised that an Afghan interpreter attached to the patrol was wounded, and had not been loaded into the vehicles. Donaldson immediately crossed the [...] or so of open ground between the convoy and the interpreter, under heavy fire, and then carried him back to the vehicles where Donaldson administered first aid. The patrol eventually broke free of the ambush after two hours.|$|E

50|$|Babydolls are now {{considered}} an eroticized item of adult apparel, often {{classified as a}} form of lingerie. Adult babydolls are quite different from the infant babydolls; they fully expose the woman's legs, and some styles emphasize or <b>deliberately</b> <b>expose</b> the breasts as well. The gown is often sold as a set with matching panties, as a typical babydoll is short enough that underwear is visible if worn. Styles of the same general length but not intended to emphasize sex appeal are sometimes called shortie nightgowns.|$|R

50|$|This {{is because}} a {{difference}} of 1 stop represents a doubling or halving of exposure.
