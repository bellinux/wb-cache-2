5000|$|Bowie {{was seriously}} {{wounded in the}} {{confrontation}} (according to one account, two bullet wounds, seven stab wounds, and other injuries due to Crain's thrown pistol, or alternatively, three bullet and four stab wounds), and required months to recover. He prominently wore a large sheath knife thereafter. Thanks to the national attention drawn by the Sandbar Fight, Bowie and his knife became well-known throughout the country as icons of a rugged frontier lifestyle. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions of the so-called Bowie knife, beginning with James Black, a blacksmith from Arkansas who designed the original for Bowie in 1830. His fame, {{and that of his}} <b>knife,</b> <b>spread</b> to England, and by the early 1830s many British knife manufacturers were also producing Bowie knives and exporting them to the United States for sale. By 1835 (while Bowie was still alive), [...] "Bowie knives" [...] were advertised (without further explanation). By 1838, a newspaper writer from New Orleans assumed that everyone had seen one. Bowie knives remained popular weapons until at least the 1870s, when large-caliber reliable pistols became widely available. The design of the knife evolved into a wide range of blades during the nineteenth century. By the middle of the twentieth century, it was associated with a more specific design: a large sheath knife with a [...] "concave clip point, sharp false edge cut from both sides, and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands".|$|R

They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, chopping, and mincing vegetables, fish, and boneless meats.

Then she took some butter (not too much) on a <b>knife</b> and <b>spread</b> it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe {{on the edge of the}} plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.|$|R
5|$|The Simpsons {{move into}} an old house, {{wondering}} at its low cost. Their questions are answered when the walls begin to bleed and objects begin to fly through the air, and Lisa senses an evil presence in the house. There is also a portal to another dimension in the kitchen. Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it, due {{to the cost of}} buying the house. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Marge unlike the others however, is instead using her <b>knife</b> to <b>spread</b> mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting - a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement. After the Spirit of The House threatens them again, Marge loses her patience and confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house thinks it over, and eventually opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.|$|R

50|$|The {{painting}} is a still life, depicting in a skilled and realistic way {{a mound of}} butter, coloured in rich, deep yellow colour, probably from the carotene of the fresh plants that the grazing cows were eating on the fields.At the time when Antoine Vollon lived it was usual to purchase the butter from the farmer, butter that was handmade at the farms. The painting has thick marks after the artist's brushwork, probably meant to illustrate the marks after the butter <b>knife</b> used to <b>spread</b> butter with or the wooden spatula, used to spread the butter with and also used in producing the butter. Kitchen scenes, food preparation and depiction of the everyday things was a usual subject for still lifes in Vollon's time. After milking, the cream was collected, churned and the butter lumps were kneaded by hand or worked with a spatula {{to get rid of}} the moisture from it, because the high amounts of buttermilk were shortening its storage life. Butter was usually stored wrapped in a cheesecloth, in a cool place. In the painting, the butter mound's cloth is falling loosely over a couple of eggs beside it.|$|R

30|$|The {{production}} of pigments {{was the work}} of specialists in the seventeenth century. There was a lively trade in pigments and other painting materials throughout Europe at the time. Artists bought their materials at an apothecary’s shop or at a grocer or colorman [1, 2]. The choice of pigments was limited, as compared to the huge selection of pigments available today. But this limited palette was by no means an obstacle for their creativity. In particular an artist like Rembrandt knew exactly which materials to combine, in order to achieve his intended painterly effects and pictorial illusion, while manipulating color contrast, texture and translucency of the paint. ‘His mixtures attain an almost comical level of complexity’, as Philip Ball rightly pointed out in his book in 2003 [3]. Furthermore, Rembrandt deliberately exploited all stages of the painting process in the final image: from ground to painted sketch to underpaint, to the final paint layers. Rembrandt’s late works (after 1651) show a fundamental change in the means with which he created pictorial illusion [4]. These works are characterized by their loose, sketchy appearance and unusual surface roughness. To realize these effects, this demanded new ways to apply the paint in order to manipulate its properties. Rembrandt started to use a palette <b>knife</b> to <b>spread</b> his paint, modelled his paint to attain texture, and scratched in the paint {{with the back of his}} brush or used his finger [5, 6]. The use of thickly impastoed, lead white passages, usually remarkably well preserved, are common throughout his entire oeuvre. In the late works Rembrandt also used lead white paint in underlayers to build up the impasto, which were then toned in the final layers [7]. The dense packing of the pigment particles primarily accounts for the stiffness of the lead white paint that remains standing after application. Groen also identified the addition of a gum in passages of red lakes, thought to have been added to thicken the paint. Another unique feature of Rembrandt’s late painting technique is the extensive use of coarse smalt, a blue cobalt glass [8, 9]. He often mixed smalt with lakes, earths and black pigments, not only for its color, but also for its drying properties and to give texture and translucency to the paint. It is not always clear to us what Rembrandt’s intentions were, since many of his late pictures have severely changed in appearance over time, as a result of paint alterations and old restorations.|$|R
500|$|Rumours {{about the}} Night of the Long <b>Knives</b> rapidly <b>spread.</b> Although many Germans {{approached}} the official {{news of the}} events as described by Joseph Goebbels {{with a great deal}} of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's [...] "personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness" [...] in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century King of Prussia. Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. [...] "A very calm and easy going mailman," [...] the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, [...] "who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply sentenced them.'" [...] It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. [...] "A chancellor", he wrote, [...] "sentences and shoots members of his own private army!" [...] The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it. Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticised Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganise the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann Göring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré from the Cabinet. Instead, the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed) and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the [...] "distant friendliness" [...] towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933.

5000|$|Almost unanimously, {{the army}} applauded the Night of the Long Knives, {{even though the}} generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. The ailing President Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered {{military}} hero, sent a telegram expressing his [...] "profoundly felt gratitude" [...] and he congratulated Hitler for [...] "nipping treason in the bud". General von Reichenau {{went so far as}} to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Ernst Röhm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. François-Poncet was not declared persona non grata as would have been usual if an Ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government. The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realise this: [...] "if you look on without lifting a finger," [...] he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, [...] "you will meet the same fate sooner or later." [...] Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.Rumours about the Night of the Long <b>Knives</b> rapidly <b>spread.</b> Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos.
