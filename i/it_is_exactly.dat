5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> the {{electron}} mass divided by 2.

25|$|In some algorithms, an {{intermediate}} result is computed {{in a larger}} precision, then must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, {{the idea is to}} round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called sticky rounding. Equivalently, it consists in returning the intermediate result when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> representable, and the nearest floating-point number with an odd significand otherwise; this is why it is also known as rounding to odd.|$|E

25|$|As can be seen, the Skjöldunga saga retells {{the story}} of Eadgils {{fighting}} his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils' uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is {{generally considered to be}} a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland. Whereas, Beowulf leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hroðulf (Rolfo Krage, Hrólfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hroðgar (Roas, Hróarr), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what he does in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in Beowulf, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hroðulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not obvious}} that the first {{definition}} makes sense: why should there exist a unique minimal convex set containing X, for every X? However, the second definition, the intersection of all convex sets containing X, is well-defined, {{and it is a}} subset of every other convex set Y that contains X, because X is included among the sets being intersected. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> the unique minimal convex set containing X. Each convex set containing X must (by the assumption that it is convex) contain all convex combinations of points in X, so the set of all convex combinations is contained in the intersection of all convex sets containing X. Conversely, the set of all convex combinations is itself a convex set containing X, so it also contains the intersection of all convex sets containing X, and therefore the sets given by these two definitions must be equal.|$|E

Just lie back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while none of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list {{for a little while}} longer." ...|$|E

On June 3, 1967, Killebrew hit a [...] home run, the longest measured home run ever hit at Metropolitan Stadium and, as of 2011, the longest in Twins history. That event is commemorated at the Mall of America in Bloomington, which includes a plaque marking home plate, and one red-painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run.

500|$|Ziad J. Asali, who {{considers}} Zionism [...] "the heir—albeit illegitimate—of the Crusader movement," [...] goes further and writes that Prawer [...] "recognized {{the extent of}} the similarity in the individual and social experience of Crusaders and Zionists. Rather than studying the comparison and denying its validity, he chose to study the Crusader's experience {{as if it were a}} historical model which could be completely analyzed and dissected in order to benefit from its experience and avoid its mistakes." [...] To Zionist author Yoram Hazony, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> because of Prawer's readiness to draw the analogy that he considers him a subverter of Zionism and a progenitor of post-Zionist thought. David Ohana, a professor of history at Ben Gurion University who rejects the Zionist-Crusader analogy, writes that the subject has now become a litmus test for clarifying one's views on Zionism, with post-Zionists freely making the analogy and sympathizers with the Zionist viewpoint rejecting it.|$|E

Leslie makes a public apology to all female government officials in alphabetical order, starting with Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, Wisconsin Democratic Rep.

On her desk, Leslie has framed photos of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again." [...] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. [...] "It's also the blockbuster," [...] Travers said, [...] "I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it [...] "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what they deserve is arguable". Conversely, A. O.
