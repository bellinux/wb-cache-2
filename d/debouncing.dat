50|$|An {{incremental}} {{rotary encoder}} provides cyclical outputs (only) when the encoder is rotated. They {{can be either}} mechanical, optical or magnetic. The mechanical type requires <b>debouncing</b> and is typically used as digital potentiometers on equipment including consumer devices. Most modern home and car stereos use mechanical rotary encoders for volume control. Due to the fact the mechanical switches require <b>debouncing,</b> the mechanical type are limited in the rotational speeds they can handle. The incremental rotary encoder is {{the most widely used}} of all rotary encoders due to its low cost and ability to provide signals that can be easily interpreted to provide motion related information such as velocity.|$|E
5000|$|To {{resolve this}} problem, the {{processor}} in a keyboard [...] "debounces" [...] the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one [...] "confirmed" [...] keystroke that (usually) corresponds {{to what is}} typically a solid contact. Early membrane keyboards had limited typing speed {{because they had to}} do significant <b>debouncing.</b> This was a noticeable problem on the ZX81.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the sophistication}} of the concept, the {{mechanism}} of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element {{about the size of}} an aspirin tablet, finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings {{to the surface of the}} PCB, forming a daisy chain of two capacitors between contact pads and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus [...] "shorting" [...] the contact pads with an easily detectable drop of capacitive reactance between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no <b>debouncing</b> necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This note {{discusses}} {{the effects on}} switches when used to connect loads. High currents through a switch degrade its quality when used as a power switch. Both mechanical switches and relays exhibit switch bounce during operation. The MAX 6816 /MAX 6817 /MAX 6818 provide switch <b>debouncing</b> and ± 15 kV ESD protection. Designing the external interface to an industrial or automotive application can be challenging for an uninitiated systems engineer. The bouncing of switch and relay contacts can produce arcs that threaten system reliability. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can also threaten reliability and uptime. The purpose of this discussion is to ease the task of designing an interface between the inputs of a microcontroller and a hostile industrial or automotive environment. Switch Bounce The ideal switch operation depicted in most textbooks—a single transition that occurs instantly on actuation, followed by zero on-resistance—has never existed! Real switches exhibit a finite resistance called "contact resistance, " that increases over time {{with the number of}} switch actuations. Contact resistance for a new switch ranges from less than 50 mΩ to 100 mΩ, depending on the contact material, power loading, environmental conditions, and switch usage. As a switch changes state, its contacts travel through several open-close cycles called "contact bounce " before coming to rest in the final state. In some cases, this rapid contact bounce produces a changing resistance as the moving contact wipes across the stationary contact. In Figure 1, a pushbutton switch supplies 24 V (a typical industrial-control voltage) to the resistor. Notice that at least four major switching transitions occur before the output comes to rest at 24 V. To a digital control system, these transitions could be interpreted as four separate contact closures. Figure 1. Switch contact bounce and test circuit. Contact bounce is not acceptable, because automotive- and industrial-control systems require accurate, realtime data in the form of definite state changes. (For more information on switch bounce and related issues, se...|$|E
40|$|A new {{hierarchical}} control strategy for active hydropneumatic suspension systems is proposed. This strategy considers the dynamic {{characteristics of the}} actuator. The top hierarchy controller uses a combined control scheme: a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based self-tuning proportional-integral-derivative controller and a fuzzy logic controller. For practical implementations of the proposed control scheme, a GA-based self-learning process is initiated only when the defined performance index of vehicle dynamics exceeds a certain <b>debounce</b> time threshold. The designed control algorithm is implemented on a virtual prototype and cosimulations are performed with different road disturbance inputs. Cosimulation {{results show that the}} active hydropneumatic suspension system designed in this study significantly improves riding comfort characteristics of vehicles. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed controller are also examined when the control system is subjected to extremely rough road conditions...|$|R
40|$|TCS is {{company that}} specialises in systems {{integration}} {{and development of}} products for industrial application. Their flagship product for distributed control is the CPU 5. This project covers the design and development of a backplane solution to solve the limitation of the CPU 5 that it only has {{a limited number of}} inputs and outputs. The next iteration of the CPU 5, is to be called the PCC. Background research was carried out into the needs of TCS and their target markets. The IEC 61499 standard, Windows CE platform and ISaGRAF software environment were also investigated. The project planning was analysed to gain an understanding of R&D project planning. This project concluded {{that it was important to}} be able to make changes to the plan as the project proceeds so that it can still be completed by the deadline. TCS had set the limitation that the backplane protocol must be a serial bus. Various different types of serial bus were investigated including CAN, USB, Light Peak (optical) and EIA 485. The bus selected was a CAN bus with a custom protocol. Research was carried out into the operation of existing bus drivers and protocols such as DeviceNet and CANOpen to determine an appropriate protocol for a serial bus based backplane. Software was developed to manage devices attached to the backplane. Hardware and software for a digital I/O module was developed. Various ways of updating the I/O were investigated, an event-based and cyclic updating method was implemented with an adjustable <b>debounce</b> time to maximise performance and robustness. Hardware and software for a serial port module was developed. A major challenge faced was to transmit a stream based protocol across a frame based CAN backplane. Software for an Ethernet module was developed. Software design included development of an NDIS compatible miniport driver for Windows CE and software for the slave module. To demonstrate that the PCC is an effective platform for distributed control, a test setup was created to be shown at a trade show in Nuremberg. The trade show setup was fully programmed in compliance with the IEC 61499 standard and demonstrated the power of the PCC...|$|R
