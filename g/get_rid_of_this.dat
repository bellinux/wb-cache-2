5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> menace.|$|E

25|$|The {{first part}} of the closing of the line was the attempt {{to get rid of the}} {{requirement}} to operate passenger trains. The original permit to operate the line included a requirement to operate passenger transport on the line, but as early as in the 1930s the company tried to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> obligation. But it was not until 1963 that the passenger traffic was terminated. By then the company had managed to convince the authorities that a bus route would be more suitable on the stretch between Orkanger and Løkken.|$|E
500|$|Night (1960) {{is a work}} by Elie Wiesel {{about his}} {{experience}} with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, {{at the height of}} the Holocaust toward the end of the Second World War. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. [...] "If only I could <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dead weight...Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever." [...] In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. [...] "Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends," [...] a kapo tells him. [...] "Everyone lives and dies for himself alone." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, [...] "t would be madness {{for the country to}} stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good." [...] However, later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes. However, Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet. By the end of the year, however, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that [...] "to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" [...] would be [...] "suicidal".|$|E

500|$|Rosenblat {{was given}} the storyline that ties up the second season. The scenes feature Miss Rosa being told that {{she is going to}} die from her cancer. Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all this effort to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> woman, just evil incarnate, you know, and then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' Amazing. That final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E
500|$|The many {{historical}} {{meanings of}} the emblem, while provide a solid ground for its power as the national emblem of Iran, have also provided the rich ground for competing symbols of Iranian identity. One important campaign to abolish the emblem was initiated by Mojtaba Minuvi in 1929. In a report prepared {{at the request of}} the Iranian embassy in London, he insisted that the lion and sun is Turkic in origin. He recommended that the government replaces it with Derafsh-e-Kaviani: [...] "One cannot attributed a national historical story to the lion-and-sun emblem, for it has no connection to ancient pre-Islamic history, there is no evidence that Iranians designed or created it.... We might as well <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> remnant of the Turkish people and adopt the flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur, that is Derafsh-e-Kaviani". His suggestion was ignored. The symbol was challenged during World War I, while Hasan Taqizadeh was publishing the Derafsh-e-Kaviani newspaper in Berlin. In his newspaper, he argued that the lion and sun is neither Iranian in origin nor very ancient as people assume. He insisted that the lion and sun should be replaced by the more Iranian symbol of Derafsh-e-Kaviani.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{announced}} {{a test of}} opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community [...] "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as [...] "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. [...] "I would ask them [...] to look again very carefully at what they rejected," [...] Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; [...] "the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guan Yu {{was once}} {{injured in the}} left arm by a stray arrow, which pierced through his arm.

A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The way to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted and drank wine and chatted with his men as though nothing had happened.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Semyon Vengerov {{quoted a}} source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna [...] "a perfect {{literary}} wife who took {{very close to}} her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible {{to keep him in}} conditions favourable to the development of his talent.

2500|$|After the War, in 1856, {{on the day}} of his Coronation, Alexander II {{appointed}} Tolstoy as one of {{his personal}} aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. [...] "You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free," [...] he {{wrote in a letter to}} Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy's poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called The Sinner. It was followed by the more significant Ioann Damaskin, first published in Russkaya Beseda January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet's position in society, but also hinting at the author's personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince Vasily Dolgorukov ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed. The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.|$|E
