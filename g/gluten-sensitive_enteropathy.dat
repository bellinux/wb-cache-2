5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy.</b> Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Celiac disease (CD) is {{a lifelong}} <b>gluten-sensitive</b> intesti-nal <b>enteropathy</b> that is multifactorial in its etiology. In the present study, we {{evaluated}} basic anthropometric, clinical, laboratory, and histological features of 140 Turkish children with CD. We particularly underscored the association of CD with other autoimmune diseases. Materials and Methods: During the period from 1999 to 2005, CD was diagnosed in 140 children according to ESPGAN criteria. The age, gender, clinical findings, hematological, and biochemical pa-rameters at diagnosis were noted. Symptoms and signs were re-corded. Endoscopic intestinal biopsies were taken from all children. Results: Of the 140 children with CD, 75 (53. 6 %) were female, and 65 (46. 4 %) were male. Mean age was 8. 56 ± 4. 43 years (range 13 months to 18 years).

40|$|Abstract Background/Aims: Prolactin (PRL) is {{produced}} by the anterior pituitary gland. It exerts its role on the breast gland but also plays a modulatory role in autoimmune mechanisms. Celiac disease (CD) is a <b>gluten-sensitive</b> autoimmune <b>enteropathy</b> sometimes associated with autoimmune endocrinopathies. No data on PRL levels in CD patients are available at diagnosis, and no conclusive data are reported. Methods: We aimed to evaluate PRL secretion in newly diagnosed CD pediatric patients and, {{in the case of}} hyperprolactinemia, any changes in its levels while the patients were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We recruited 67 patients and 39 healthy controls. Results: PRL was statistically higher in the CD patients (13. 5 ± 9. 2 ng/ml) than in the controls (8. 5 ± 5. 0 ng/ml). In the CD group, PRL was inversely correlated with the age at diagnosis (r = - 0. 326; p = 0. 007). In patients with hyperprolactinemia at diagnosis, PRL decreased after 6 months of GFD. Conclusion: This paper confirms that PRL may be increased at diagnosis of CD and shows, for the first time, that it decreases after a short course of GFD. Changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in CD may account for changes in PRL levels. Younger patients seem more prone to develop hyperprolactinemia than older ones...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is {{a common}} <b>gluten-sensitive</b> {{autoimmune}} <b>enteropathy.</b> A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment, but compliance is demanding; hence, new treatment strategies for CeD are required. OBJECTIVE: Parasitic helminths hold promise for treating inflammatory disorders, so we examined the influence of experimental hookworm infection on the predicted outcomes of escalating gluten challenges in CeD subjects. METHODS: A 52 -week study was conducted involving 12 adults with diet-managed CeD. Subjects were inoculated with 20 Necator americanus larvae, and escalating gluten challenges consumed as pasta were subsequently administered: (1) 10 to 50 mg for 12 weeks (microchallenge); (2) 25 mg daily + 1 g twice weekly for 12 weeks (GC- 1 g); and (3) 3 g daily (60 - 75 straws of spaghetti) for 2 weeks (GC- 3 g). Symptomatic, serologic, and histological outcomes evaluated gluten toxicity. Regulatory and inflammatory T cell populations in blood and mucosa were examined. RESULTS: Two gluten-intolerant subjects were withdrawn after microchallenge. Ten completed GC- 1 g, 8 of whom enrolled in and completed GC- 3 g. Primary outcomes: median villous height-to-crypt depth ratios (2. 60 - 2. 63; P =. 98) did not decrease as predicted after GC- 1 g, and the mean IgA-tissue transglutaminase titers declined, contrary to the predicted rise after GC- 3 g. Secondary outcomes: quality of life scores improved (46. 3 - 40. 6; P =. 05); celiac symptom indices (24. 3 - 24. 3; P =. 53), intra-epithelial lymphocyte percentages (32. 5 - 35. 0; P =. 47), and Marsh scores were unchanged by gluten challenge.

40|$|Background: Celiac {{disease is}} a lifelong, <b>gluten-sensitive,</b> autoimmune-mediated chronic <b>enteropathy,</b> tightly {{associated}} with risk alleles at the HLA class II genes. Aims: This study was carried out {{as a part of}} the population-based Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Project. The first aim was to study the natural history of celiac disease-associated antibodies before the diagnosis of celiac disease was made. The second aim was to describe when and in which order celiac disease-associated and type 1 diabetes-associated antibodies appeared in children with genetic risk for both diseases. Subjects and Methods: Antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (TGA) and other celiac disease-associated antibodies were measured in serum samples collected at 3 - to 12 -month intervals of children at genetic risk for celiac disease who participated in the DIPP project. Celiac disease was confirmed by duodenal biopsy. Type 1 diabetes-associated antibodies were measured in all samples that had been collected. Overt disease was diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. Follow-up continued until a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or until the end of a defined follow-up period. Results: TGA appeared in children at genetic risk for celiac disease only after the first year of life, but anti-gliadin antibodies often emerged significantly earlier, at age 6 months. The data show that spontaneous disappearance of celiac disease-associated antibodies, transient or persisting, is a common phenomenon, at least in prepubertal children. In children with genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, celiac disease-associated antibodies usually develop earlier than the type 1 diabetes-associated antibodies. Conclusions: The transient nature of celiac disease-associated antibodies emphasizes the significance of establishing seropositivity repeatedly in screening detected celiac disease before gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy are considered and emphasized the importance of duodenal biopsy for diagnosing celiac disease...|$|R

50|$|Gliadins {{are known}} for their role, along with glutenin, in the {{formation}} of gluten. They are slightly soluble in ethanol and contain only intramolecular disulfide links. They also cause some of the best examples of food-derived pathogenesis. People with <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> (the severe form of which is celiac disease) are sensitive to α, β, and γ gliadins. Those with WD urticaria and Baker's asthma are sensitive to ω-gliadins.Gliadin can also serve as a useful delivery method for sensitive enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, which is fused with gliadin to form glisodin) - this helps protect them from stomach acids that cause breakdown.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> and its {{common and}} more severe form, coeliac disease, {{results in the}} {{increased}} inflammation of the tissues of the small bowel, eventually leading to villus atrophy. The disease progresses from increased lymphocyte counts to eventual flattening of the villi, and crypt hyperplasia. Originally, oats were believed to cause coeliac disease. However, this confusion was largely due to significant contamination of oats with wheat, barley, or rye. A recent review of controlled oat tolerance studies indicated only one documented avenin-sensitive enteropathy (ASE) in 165, placing the risk of ASE at 0.6% of the coeliac disease population. However, during the controlled studies, 17 candidates dropped out due to symptoms after ingestion of gluten-free oats and were not tested {{at the completion of}} their respective studies. As a result, the actual risk of ASE in the coelic disease population may be slightly higher.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis of gluten-sensitive neuropathies {{without a}} clear cause is on the rise. These {{idiopathic}} neuropathies were first identified by screening for anti-gliadin IgG (AGA). The criteria have been critiqued {{because of the large}} misdiagnosis rate of coeliac disease (CD), and because AGA exists in the normal population at over 12%, far more abundant than cases of neuropathy. The problem in diagnosis arises because there are precursor states prior to coeliac disease. These are called [...] coeliac disease and early <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> and are defined as Marsh grade 1 and 2 coeliac disease. Coeliac disease was diagnosed by duodenal biopsy, often misinterpreted as negative as high as grade 3 on the Marsh scale. Anti-gliadin antibodies may precede or lag the appearance of coeliac disease. Studies in Scandinavia found an increase of pathologies as much as 10 years before coeliac disease. These included gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia or other autoimmune disease. In addition IgG and IgA responses sometimes accompany allergic responses to proteins. Gliadin is exceptional in that it has several proteins which remain peptides of considerable length after digestion, and migrate into systemic circulation.|$|E
50|$|Studies on {{farmers with}} grain dust allergy and {{children}} with atopy dermatitis reveal that oat proteins can act as both respiratory and skin allergens. Oat dust sensitivity in farms found 53% showed reactivity to dust, second only to barley (70%), and almost double that of wheat dust. The 66 kDa protein in oats was visualized by 28 out of 33 sera (84%). However, there was evident non-specific binding to this region and thus it may also represent lectin-like binding. IgA and IgG responses, meanwhile, like those seen to anti-gliadin antibodies in celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, are not seen in response to avenins in atopic dermatitis patients. Food allergies to oats can accompany atopy dermatitis. Oat avenins share similarities with γ and ω-gliadins of wheat — based on these similarities they could potentiate both enteropathic response and anaphylactic responses. Oat allergy in <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> can explain an avenin-sensitive individual with no histological abnormality, no T-cell reaction to avenin, bearing the rarer DQ2.5trans phenotype, and with anaphylactic reaction to avenin.|$|E
5000|$|As an MHC class II antigen-presenting receptor, DQ {{functions}} as a dimer containing two protein subunits, alpha (DQA1 gene product) and beta (DQB1 gene product), a DQ heterodimer. These receptors {{can be made from}} alpha+beta sets of two different DQ haplotypes, one set from the maternal and paternal chromosome. If one carries haplotype -A-B- from one parent and -a-b- from the other, that person makes 2 alpha isoforms (A and a) and 2 beta isoforms (B and b). This can produce 4 slightly different receptor heterodimers (or more simply, DQ isoforms). Two isoforms are in the -haplotype pairing (AB and ab) and 2 are in the trans-haplotype pairing (Ab and aB). Such a person is a double heterozygote for these genes, for DQ the most popular situation. If a person carries haplotypes -A-B- and -A-b- then they can only make 2 DQ (AB and Ab), but if a person carries haplotypes -A-B- and -A-B- then they can only make DQ isoform AB, called a double homozygote.

40|$|Tropical sprue is an {{acquired}} chronic diarrheal disorder of unclear etiology affecting residents of and visitors to tropical regions.

The cohort comprised 6 men and 6 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 38 to 78 y) with a history of residence or visitation in South Asia or Papua New Guinea. Partial villous blunting in the duodenal mucosa was present in 75 % of cases, and a marked intraepithelial lymphocytosis was observed in all cases (mean per 100 epithelial cells 77. 3; range, 42 to 124). A villous tip accentuation of intraepithelial lymphocytosis was not appreciable in most cases. No case of complete villous blunting (Marsh stage 3 c) was identified in tropical sprue, contrasting with 25 % in <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> cases. A duodenal mucosa eosinophil infiltrate was present in all cases with significantly higher counts compared with untreated <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy</b> patients (26. 6 /HPF vs. 14. 6 /HPF; P= 0. 009).

There was no increase in HLA-DR 3 on nonextended haplotypes or in other extended haplotypes with HLA-DR 3 or DR 7. The distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes for HLA-DR 3 and DR 7 was consistent with recessive inheritance of the {{major histocompatibility complex}}-linked susceptibility gene for <b>gluten-sensitive</b> <b>enteropathy.</b> On the other hand, by odds ratio analysis and from the sum of DR 3 and DR 7 homozygotes compared with DR 3 /DR 7 heterozygotes, {{there was an increase}} in heterozygotes and a decrease in homozygotes suggesting the presence of modifying phenomena...|$|E
