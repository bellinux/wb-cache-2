5000|$|The Conservative Party {{platform}} {{addresses a}} range of fiscal and social issues. In the fiscal realm, the Party supports reduced individual and corporate taxes, right to work laws, tort reform, repeal of <b>inheritance</b> (<b>estate)</b> taxes, and limits on the growth of state spending, and opposes minimum wage increases. Regarding law enforcement, the Party advocates repeal of the SAFE Act, reinstatement of the death penalty, no parole for convicted felons, {{and the use of}} [...] "stop-and-frisk" [...] policing, and opposes the legalization of mind-altering drugs. On social issues, the Party opposes abortion except when {{the life of the mother}} is in danger, opposes the legalization of assisted suicide, supports educational choice, opposes same-sex marriage, opposes the DREAM Act, and promotes adoption. The Party advocates government reform efforts such as term limits, initiative and referendum, recall, a ban on legislative member items, and voter identification requirements, and opposes taxpayer funding of campaigns.|$|E
50|$|In about 1343 an {{agreement}} {{had been made}} for a double marriage between, on the one hand, Mowbray and Audrey Montagu, the granddaughter of Thomas of Brotherton, {{and on the other}} hand, Mowbray's sister, Blanche, and Audrey's brother, Edward Montagu. Neither marriage took place. Instead, about 1349 a double marriage was solemnized between, on the one hand, Mowbray and Elizabeth Segrave, and on the other hand, Mowbray's sister Blanche, and Elizabeth Segrave's brother John, Pope Clement VI having granted dispensations for the marriages {{at the request of the}} Earl of Lancaster in order to prevent 'disputes between the parents', who were neighbours. Mowbray had little financial benefit from his marriage during his lifetime as a result of the very large jointure which had been awarded to Elizabeth Segrave's mother, Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who lived until 1399. However, when Elizabeth Segrave's father, John de Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave, died on 1 April 1353, Edward III allowed Mowbray to receive a small portion of his wife's eventual <b>inheritance.</b> <b>Estate</b> accounts for 1367 indicate that Mowbray enjoyed an annual income of almost £800 at that time.|$|E

40|$|As real <b>estate</b> <b>inheritances</b> are an {{important}} component of Austrian households’ assets, they are relevant for monetary policymaking and for the maintenance of financial stability. 20 % of Austrian households have inherited real estate wealth, with some 2 % of all households accounting for around 40 % of the overall volume of real <b>estate</b> <b>inheritances</b> in Austria. In aggregate, real <b>estate</b> <b>inheritances</b> constitute up to 23 % of households’ total real estate wealth. Households which have inherited differ from those which have not in so far as the former have a higher level of education, earn higher incomes and possess greater real estate wealth. The largest inheritance ratio is in the age group of 50 - to 70 -year-olds. Households with greater real estate wealth and higher income inherit more often, and they receive larger inheritances. Yet the relative share of inherited real estate properties in total real estate wealth is larger among households with smaller real estate wealth. Less well-off households may come into comparatively considerable real estate wealth through an <b>inheritance.</b> Real <b>estate</b> <b>inheritances</b> are of particular importance for farmers. The majority of real estate owners plan to bequeath their real estate. This intention is rather independent from wealth and income levels. wealth, distribution, inheritances...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} two objectives. The {{first is to}} study the revenue from the gift, <b>inheritance,</b> and <b>estate</b> taxes in Sweden during more than a century. The second {{is to focus on}} a unique episode {{during the second half of}} the 1940 s when gifts and gift tax revenue exploded. This episode has never before been {{discussed}} in the research literature. It gives an extremely clear illustration of behavioral response to taxes in general, and the impact of expectations of future tax increases in particular. It is also a very interesting episode in the economic history of Sweden. I have access to aggregate tax revenue data since 1884. Moreover, I have constructed a rich micro data set of all gifts reported during the period 1942 – 1949 in one county. A first main result is that gift tax revenue during the 1940 s started to increase long before a new estate tax and increased wealth taxation were decided and implemented. The increase even began before the legislative process started. Second, both the number and the average values of gifts increased. Promissory notes were, in value, the most common way to give. Finally, gifts, <b>inheritances,</b> and <b>estates</b> were never important sources of tax revenue. Revenue as a share of GDP reached a peak already in the 1930 s. The role of these taxes has instead primarily been equity and to provide integrity for other tax bases. gift tax; <b>inheritance</b> tax; <b>estate</b> tax; tax avoidance; expectations...|$|R

50|$|Employing differing {{forms of}} {{succession}} can affect {{many areas of}} society. Gender roles are profoundly affected by inheritance laws and traditions.

Inheritance customs can even affect gender differences in cognitive abilities.
