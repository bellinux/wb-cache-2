5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and understand experiences of <b>healthy</b> <b>dieting</b> in male college students with obesity. MethodsThe interview data were collected from nine male students and analyzed by using descriptive phenomenology of Colaizzi. The procedural steps described the phenomenon of interest, collected participants' descriptions of the phenomenon, extracted the meaning of significant statements, organized the meanings into clusters, wrote exhaustive descriptions, and then incorporated data into an exhaustive description. ResultsThe findings in 246 restatements, 47 constructed meanings, 31 themes, eight theme clusters, and four categories were deduced. The four categories were “Uneasiness at interpersonal relationships”, “Developing durability in <b>dieting</b> strategies”, “Practicing <b>healthy</b> <b>diets</b> based on information”, and “Perceived on <b>healthy</b> <b>diets</b> as a whole health support strategies”. ConclusionThis study described experiences in <b>healthy</b> <b>dieting</b> of male college students who were discharged from military services. These findings have important implications for understanding <b>healthy</b> <b>dieting</b> in young men and must be considered in developing health promotion in youth...|$|R

25|$|Generally, {{liver damage}} from {{cirrhosis}} cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A <b>healthy</b> <b>diet</b> is encouraged, as cirrhosis {{may be an}} energy-consuming process. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis A, B, and D are {{preventable}} with immunization. Medications {{may be used}} {{to treat}} chronic cases of viral hepatitis. There is no specific treatment for NASH; however, a healthy lifestyle, including physical activity, a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet,</b> and weight loss, is important. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may also be an option in certain cases.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common forms of {{treatment}} that are crucial {{for individuals to}} carry out to combat obesity include changing to a <b>healthier</b> <b>diet</b> and increasing their physical exercise.

25|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} disease, {{for which there}} is no known cure except in very specific situations. Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet,</b> exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type2 diabetes).|$|E
25|$|It is also {{recommended}} {{to eat a}} <b>healthy</b> <b>diet</b> and avoid sugary foods and limit the intake of salt. Also, ensure that your cholesterol levels are under control. Exercise is a must for all diabetics. Walking twice a day for 30 minutes can be a fair substitute for those not engaged in intense gym activities. Losing weight is also beneficial as this {{has been shown to}} improve blood sugar control, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) is an {{advocacy}} group founded in 2002 by Robert Verkerk and based in the United Kingdom. The ANH was initially founded to raise funds to finance a legal challenge of the EU Food Supplement Directive. The ANH lobbies against regulation of dietary supplements and in favor of alternative medical approaches such as homeopathy, and also advocates a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet,</b> exercise, and other lifestyle approaches to health. Verkerk rejects scientific research showing that megadoses of vitamins lack any health benefit.|$|E

40|$|The {{report is}} a {{scientific}} {{contribution to the}} European Commission's Integrated Product Policy framework, which seeks to minimise the environmental degradation caused throughout {{the life cycle of}} products. This report first presents an overview of the environmental impact cause by current dietary habits in EU 27. It then develops three alternative diets on the basis of health recommendations from EFSA, WHO and other organisations, and calculates the changes in environmental impacts achievable through a shift towards these diets. Finally the report analyses policy measures which stimulate the uptake of <b>healthy</b> <b>diets</b> by consumers. The report shows that current dietary habits in Europe are responsible for 27 % of all environmental impacts in Europe. A shift to <b>healthier</b> <b>diets</b> shows that the contribution to overall environmental impacts in Europe can be reduced to 25 % in case of reduced consumption of red meat. The contribution reduces to just 26 % if indirect effects such as household budget re-distribution and price and substitution effects in the agricultural sector are taken into account. Because food and nutrition are strongly rooted in traditions and habits, policy measures aiming at stimulating a change towards <b>healthy</b> <b>diets</b> need to include a combination of different instruments, ranging from consumer awareness raising to public procurement activities.

25|$|The {{treatment}} of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy {{may also be}} helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|The Mayo Clinic has {{suggested}} seven steps: stay mentally active, socialize regularly, get organized, eat a <b>healthy</b> <b>diet,</b> include {{physical activity in}} your daily routine, and manage chronic conditions. Because some {{of the causes of}} memory loss include medications, stress, depression, heart disease, alcohol abuse, thyroid problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, not drinking enough water, and not eating nutritiously, fixing those problems could be a simple, effective way to slow down dementia. Some say that exercise {{is the best way to}} prevent memory problems, because that would increase blood flow to the brain and perhaps help new brain cells grow.|$|E
25|$|Where PCOS is {{associated}} with overweight or obesity, successful weight loss {{is the most effective}} method of restoring normal ovulation/menstruation, but many women find it very difficult to achieve and sustain significant weight loss. A scientific review in 2013 found similar decreases in weight and body composition and improvements in pregnancy rate, menstrual regularity, ovulation, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, lipids, and quality of life to occur with weight loss independent of diet composition. Still, a low GI diet, in which a significant part of total carbohydrates are obtained from fruit, vegetables, and whole-grain sources, has resulted in greater menstrual regularity than a macronutrient-matched <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E
