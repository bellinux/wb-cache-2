There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E

5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include <b>fuel</b> <b>combustion</b> in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>combustion.</b> Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>combustion,</b> or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E

25|$|Coal can {{be found}} in {{abundance}} in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - oil, coal, and natural gas - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of global electricity generation.
