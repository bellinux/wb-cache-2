50|$|At Gimingham {{the river}} flows {{into a series}} of Mill Ponds. These ponds fed Gimingham {{watermill}} (Nat Grid Ref TG28663690) which is the first of two mills that stood on the river. The Mill dam once held back a 20 acre broad fed by the River. The water ran under the Mill street to reach the waterwheel, which was probably originally overshot. There has been a mill at this point since the time of the Domesday book. The last mill to work here was built of local brick and flint brought in from local beaches. The original waterwheel went fairly early on, first being supplemented by steam and then replaced by a turbine with half twist drive in 1912 and then later by diesel engines, although water was still used for cooling them. The mill carried on working until 30 November 1976, using its diesel power to mill animal feedstuffs. The watermill was worked in conjunction with the nearby Gimingham postmill until 1877. The original <b>heavy</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> engine has been carefully preserved and stands on Mill Street just below the old mill. Gimingham Mill Lake is a very popular fishing location. In the lake, pit and river, Bream, Carp, Tench and Roach can be caught.From Gimingham the river cross more open farm land now heading east, passing on its left Mundesley Hospital which was refurbished in 1997 and is now the Diana Princess of Wales Treatment Centre for Drug and Alcohol Problems. Where the road leading up to the hospital crosses the River Mun, the Environment Agency has a Water Resource Management gauging station. From here the river begins to skirt the southern side of the coastal village of Mundesley.|$|E

Presently, electricity on the island is supplied almost entirely by a <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>oil</b> utility, Belco, which is expecting to retire almost 50 % of their generators in the next six years. At the same time, Bermuda’s Department of Energy is developing a new Energy Policy and establishing an independent Regulatory Authority.

The first section of the report describes the current energy model in Bermuda and two currently proposed plans for the future.

40|$|<b>Diesel</b> <b>oil</b> is {{a complex}} mixture of {{hydrocarbons}} with an average carbon number of C 8 – C 26. The majority of components consist of alkanes, both straight chained and branched and aromatic compounds including mono-, di- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Regardless of this complexity, <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> can be readily degraded {{by a number of}} soil microorganisms making it a likely candidate for bioremediation. The concept of using plants to enhance bioremediation, termed phytoremediation, is a relatively new area of scientific interest. It is particularly applicable to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contamination as <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> generally contaminates the top few metres of soil (surface soil) and contamination is not uniform throughout the site. By encouraging plants to grow on <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil, conditions are improved for the microbial degradation of the contaminant. During this study, establishing plants on <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil proved difficult. <b>Diesel</b> <b>oil</b> is phytotoxic to plants at relatively low concentrations. At concentrations below this phytotoxic level, the development of plants grown in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil differs greatly from plants grown in uncontaminated soil. Tolerance of plants to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> and ability to germinate in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil varied greatly between plant species as well as within plant species.

In order to study the mechanisms for reduction in the injection pressure of low permeability wells by the SNPA-diesel oil system injection, the microstructure of SNPAs was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle size distribution of SNPAs was also measured by the laser scattering method. The viscosities of <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> and SNPA-diesel oil system were measured with a capillary viscometer. The effect of SNPAs on the solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> was experimentally studied.

A pore-throat film displacement model (PTFDM) was built for mechanism explanation. The microstructure and size distribution analyses show that the SNPAs are in the nanometer size range. The viscosity of the SNPA-diesel oil system is lower than that of the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil.</b> The solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> increases greatly due to SNPA addition, the solubility ratio reaches 7.5.
