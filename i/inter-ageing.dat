40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the observed phenotypic stability in static strength during adolescence, as measured by <b>inter-age</b> correlations in arm pull (ARP), is mainly caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. Methods: Subjects are from the Leuven Longitudinal Twin Study (LLTS) (n= 105 pairs, equally divided over five zygosity groups).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether the observed phenotypic stability in explosive strength during adolescence, as measured by <b>inter-age</b> correlations in vertical jump (VTJ), is mainly caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. METHODS: Subjects are from the Leuven Longitudinal Twin Study (LLTS) (n = 105 pairs, equally divided over five zygosity groups). VTJ data were aligned on age at peak height velocity (APHV) to attenuate the temporal fluctuations in <b>inter-age</b> correlations caused by differences in timing of the adolescent growth spurt. Simplex models were fitted using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: After aligning the data on APHV, the annual <b>inter-age</b> correlations show a clear simplex structure over a 4 year interval. The best fitting models included additive genetic and unique environmental sources of variation. Heritability estimates ranged between 60. 8 % (CI 37. 7 %- 77. 2 %) and 87. 3 % (CI 74. 2 %- 94. 0 %) for boys and between 76. 5 % (CI 56. 7 %- 89. 0 %) and 88. 6 % (CI 77. 8 %- 94. 1 %) for girls. Up to 56. 4 % and 62. 8 % of the total variation at the last measurement occasion is explained by additive genetic factors that already explained {{a significant amount of}} variation at previous measurement occasions in boys and girls respectively. It thus can be concluded that the observed stability of explosive strength during adolescence is mainly caused by a stable genetic influence in boys and girls.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} word-finding {{difficulty is}} one of the most investigated characteristics of language ageing. The transmission deficit model postulates an age-related weakening in the pathway from lexicon to phonology, leading to insufficient priming of the complete phonology. To bring neurophysiological evidence of age-related modifications in word production, we investigated the <b>inter-age</b> time course of ERPs in picture naming compared to picture-word verification, where lexical-phonological processes are not involved. Only marginal age-related differences in RTs were found in picture naming. Older adults showed lower accuracy in picture naming, but higher accuracy in picture-word verification. Between-age ERP divergences were observed in an early time window associated with semantic processes. In picture naming, age differences in ERP amplitudes were also observed in a later time window compatible with phonological processing. Results suggest that modifications in word production could stem from age-related changes affecting the processing dynamics in the semantic system...|$|R

Multicentre, prospective, descriptive study. Setting. Fifty-six public hospitals in nine provinces (a stratified, random sample of all hospitals treating gynaecological emergencies). Patients. All women of gestation under 22 weeks who presented with incomplete abortion during the 2 -week study period. Main outcome measures. Incidence of, morbidity associated with and mortality from incomplete abortion. Main results. An estimated 44, 686 (95 % CI 35, 633 - 53, 709) women per year were admitted to South Africa's public hospitals with incomplete abortion. An estimated 425 (95 % CI 78 - 735) women die in public hospitals from complications of abortion. Fifteen per cent (95 % CI 13 - 18) of patients have severe morbidity while a further 19 % (95 % CI 16 - 22) have moderate morbidity, as assessed by categories designed for the study which largely reflect infection.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{problems}} of social development of adolescents in multiple-aged groups (MAG). Methods. The methods involve socio-personal approach, consideration of the subject in a certain ideological humanistic orientation, comparative analysis, and comparison of historical facts, the study of social phenomena of different ages, long-term scientific observations, reflections, a retrospective analysis of personal experience. Results. The author describes objective conditions for the uprise of extremist, subcultural youth of multiple-aged groups, and the reasons whence they begin to perform distinctive functions that are specific for teenagers. Options for models of MAG humanistic educational systems formed in Russian and foreign social and pedagogical practice are listed. A complex of pedagogical conditions provided {{for the formation of}} social competence of adolescents in multiple-aged associations of humanistic orientation is considered. It has been found that this type of system is characterized by the following features: the principle of voluntary association of people, independence of subjects, rapid adaptation to changing socio-cultural situation, a variety of activities by interests, alternating change of activities, conflict resolution within the team, a high level of team spirit, selfmanagement, the creative nature of educational process, upbringing, socialization and self-realization. A brief description of conditions for development of fundamental human values among adolescents and formation of new specific complicated humanistic human and personal relations in global world is given. Scientific novelty. The author studies the following concepts: educational system of multiple-aged associations, teenager social competence, ambivalent behavior, emotional and moral compass of personality, invisible assets of the team, emergent effect of multiple-aged groups, <b>inter-age</b> communication. It was found that the specificity of MAG educational potential is determined by the conditions for the appearance of multiple-aged associations as a system-forming principle; all members of association are freely operating subjects, which consciously accept external restrictions caused by multiple-aged membership of participants of any activity. Relations of freedom, an openness, trust, equality, safety, collective unity in MAG provide introduction of emerging effect of display of the hidden assets of a personality. The substantial part of MAG space allows to create for its each member enough of educational reality situations and representations about actions in them that creates conditions for positive changes both the separate person, and all community as a whole. The humanistic orientation of MAG activity is that it’s each participant, joining cultural traditions, ethnic, civil and universal values, adopting life experience of others, keeps own uniqueness.

40|$|A major {{consequence}} of the persisting low birth rates and still-rising longevity experienced in many European and some Asian countries is an aging workforce. How serious a concern should this be for the course of economic growth? In particular, what effect does it have on labor productivity, as measured by output per worker? And what does the experience thus far in adapting to an older workforce suggest for future labor market and human capital policies in a fast-aging world? Economic theory provides no simple answers to these questions. Older workers {{tend to be more}} experienced and perhaps more competent managers; younger workers may be better educated, healthier, and more energetic and intellectually agile. Labor market institutions and practices may promote or impede substitutability among workers of differing ages. Indirect demographic effects on productivity also exist, working through capital and product markets, schooling quality, and the pace of innovation.

We reviewed published genetic parameters from over 100 field trials and calculated average values for key growth, wood property, tree architecture, and fitness traits. Parameter estimates from control-pollinated progeny trials were rare. However, numerous parameter estimates were available from open-pollinated progeny trials for several traits, such as diameter and wood basic density, suggesting that for this mating type our average parameter estimates {{are likely to be}} robust. In open-pollinated trials, average heritabilities for growth traits (e. g., ̄h 2 op= 0. 26 for diameter) were generally lower than those for wood property traits (e. g., ̄h 2 op = 0. 51 for basic density).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the age-specific tracking of adult health- and performance-related fitness scores. In addition, the independent contribution of adolescent physical characteristics to the explanation of adult fitness scores was also studied. The sample consisted of 173 adults observed at age 30 years. These subjects had been followed at annual intervals from age 13 to age 18 years and were remeasured at age 30 years. At each age nine fitness tests were administered together with the recording of anthropometric dimensions, biological maturation, sports participation and family characteristics. Tracking {{was measured by the}} <b>inter-age</b> correlations at each age between 13 and 18 years and the performance scores at 30 years. The independent contribution of characteristics observed during adolescence to the explanation of adult fitness was investigated through stepwise multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis with the adult fitness scores as the dependent variables and the fitness, maturation, anthropometric characteristics, sports participation and family background as the independent variables. Tracking between age 13 and age 30 years was moderately high (46 % of variance explained) for flexibility, low to moderate (between 19 % and 27 % of variance explained) for the other fitness parameters and low for pulse recovery and static strength (7 % to 11 % of variance explained). Between age 18 and age 30 years the tracking was high for flexibility, moderately high for explosive and static strength, and moderate for the other fitness parameters except for pulse recovery.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{stability of}} physical fitness and physical activity from adolescence into middle adulthood in Flemish females. METHODS: Within {{the scope of the}} Leuven Longitudinal Study on Lifestyle, Fitness and Health, 138 females (mean age= 16. 6 +/- 1. 1 yr) from the Leuven Growth Study of Flemish Girls were seen in adulthood (mean age= 40. 5 +/- 1. 1 yr). Several body dimensions and motor fitness tests were taken. Physical activity was assessed by means of a sports participation inventory. <b>Inter-age</b> correlations were calculated between adolescent and adult values. Cross-tabulation was used to identify the percentage of subjects remaining in the same BMI and physical activity group or shifting from one group to another from adolescence to adulthood. Odds ratios for less activity and overweight in adulthood according to adolescent activity or weight status were calculated. RESULTS: Except for flamingo balance, plate tapping, leg lifts, and arm pull, all anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics were stable from adolescence to adulthood (r ranging from 0. 49 to 0. 96). Sports participation was not a stable characteristic (r= 0. 13). From adolescence to adulthood, 84. 5 and 63. 6 %, respectively, remained in the normal-weight and overweight group, whereas 62. 5 and 54. 4 %, respectively, remained in the less active and active group. The odds of being overweight in adulthood was 9. 53 (95 % CI: 3. 1 - 29. 8) times greater in overweight compared with normal-weight adolescent girls. CONCLUSION: In Flemish females, anthropometric and fitness characteristics demonstrate higher levels of stability from adolescence to middle adulthood than physical activity. Weight status during adolescence is indicative of adult weight status, and a pattern of less activity rather than activity tends to continue from youth to adulthood. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHand, {{foot and}} mouth disease (HFMD) {{is a common}} {{childhood}} infection and has become a major public health issue in China. Considerable research has focused on the role of meteorological factors such as temperature and relative humidity in HFMD development. However, no studies have specifically quantified the impact of another major environmental agent, excessive heat, on HFMD. The current study was designed to help address this research gap. MethodsCase-based HFMD surveillance data and daily meteorological data collected between 2010 and 2012 was obtained from China CDC and the National Meteorological Information Center, respectively. Distributed lag nonlinear models were applied {{to assess the impact of}} excessive heat on HFMD and its variability across social-economic status and age groups. ResultsAfter controlling the effects of several potential confounders, the commonly hot days were found to positively affect the HFMD burdens with the relative risk (RR) peaking at around 6 days of lag. The RR of HFMD in the Pearl-River Delta Region was generally higher and persisted longer than that in the remaining developing areas. Regarding the <b>inter-age</b> group discrepancy, children aged 3 – 6 years old had the highest risk of HFMD under conditions of excessive heat whereas those greater than 6 years old had the lowest. The lag structure of the impact of the extremely hot days was quite similar to that of the commonly hot days, although the relative effect of these two kinds of conditions of excessive heat might vary across regions. ConclusionsThis study indicated significantly facilitating effects of excessive heat on HFMD especially among those aged 3 – 6 and from developed areas.

40|$|Background - Flavonoids are an {{important}} category of non-nutrient food components with antioxidant and other potentially significant biological properties. Evidence from laboratory-based in vitro studies provide compelling evidence supporting the involvement of dietary flavonoid intake in human chronic disease risk. However, studies on associations between intakes of individual flavonoids and disease outcomes at the population level are scarce. Objective - To identify patterns and sources of dietary intake of individual flavonoids in the Australian population. Design - Data from the 24 -hour diet recall questionnaire of the national nutrition survey (NNS 95 - involving {{a representative sample of}} 10851 subjects) were combined with USDA data on flavonoid content of foods to identify consumption patterns and key sources. Outcomes - Black and green teas clearly were the dominant sources of the flavonols and flavon- 3 -ols. The largest flavonol sources comprised onion (isorhamnetin and quercetin), broccoli (kaempferol and quercetin), apple (quercetin), grape (quercetin), coffee (myrcetin) and beans (quercetin). Oranges (hesperetin and naringenin), lemon (eriodictyol), mandarin (hesperetin) and grapefruit (naringenin) were the major flavonone sources and parsley (apigenin), celery (apigenin and luteolin) and English spinach (luteolin) were the major flavone sources. Wine was the major anthocyanadin source (delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin and petunidin), with smaller amounts from cherry (pelargonidin and peonidin) and blueberry (delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin and petunidin). Conclusion - The major dietary flavonoid sources for Australian adults are restricted to {{a relatively small number of}} key foods. <b>Inter-age</b> variations in flavonoid intake are particularly pronounced for naringenin and some anthocyanins. The complexity of consumption patterns for individual flavonoids indicates that the promotion of foods on the basis of antioxidant content (as a general phenomenon) oversimplifies the issue and potentially understates the contribution that vegetables and fruits make to good health.

Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data {{and the structure of}} potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R 0 from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and <b>inter-age</b> groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R 0 under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R 0 than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R 0 and age-specific R 0...|$|R
40|$|Egg {{predation}} may be {{the most}} important mortality factor for North American turtles. This predation can destroy 50 - 90 % of nests in an area. The major predators are striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Despite differences in their habits and diet, these species appear equally efficient in turtle egg predation, even though these eggs represent a very small portion of their annual food intake. Sight, olfaction, touch and hearing could be used by these predators to find the nests. The aim of this study was to document intra and inter-specific differences in the perception of possible nest-cues used by raccoon and striped skunk. Choice-tests based on food-conditioning were carried out with two visual cues (dark and smooth surface), one olfactory cue (turtle urine) and one tactile cue (soil compaction). Subject performances (number of trials to obtain 80 % success rate in the different tests) were compared to assess intra and inter-species, and skunk <b>inter-age</b> differences in sensory perception and learning abilities. As expected raccoons learned the tactile cue discrimination faster than the visual cue discriminations. The tactile cue discrimination was learned as fast as the olfactory cue. As expected skunks learned the olfactory cue discrimination faster than other cue discriminations. When compared, the olfactory cue appeared to be as important for both species even though raccoons had faster learning rates than skunks in all the tests except for one visual test. Juvenile skunks learned faster than adult skunks with four out of six juveniles performing better in the olfactory test. Olfaction may play an important role in nest localization by raccoons and skunks, and sight may also play a role for raccoons. Learning turtle nest cues while with their mother could facilitate their future ability in locating turtle nests...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} the {{assessment}} of mercury burden and its association to damage vs. antioxidant protection in the bivalve Scrobicularia plana environmentally exposed to mercury. <b>Inter-age</b> and organ-specific approaches were applied by using different annual size classes (2 +, 3 +, 4 + and 5 + year old) and assessing specific organs (gills, digestive gland), respectively. Bivalves were collected from moderately and highly contaminated sites at Laranjo basin – Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), where a mercury gradient was identified, and compared with those from a reference site. Besides total and organic mercury accumulation, endpoints combining lipid peroxidation (LPO), as a damage sign, and antioxidant protection (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; glutathione S-transferase, GST, activities) were determined. The whole-body accumulation as total mercury changed according to the environmental gradient for all age classes, while in terms of organic mercury, only 5 +-year-old animals showed increased accumulation with increased environmental mercury level. Mercury induced peroxidative damage, showing that antioxidative mechanisms were insufficient. The adaptive capacity to pro-oxidant challenge, expressed as antioxidant induction and lesser vulnerability to enzyme inhibition, increased with age. The specific analyses of gills and digestive gland revealed that both organs were able to mirror external levels of exposure in the accumulation of total and organic mercury. Nevertheless, gills displayed higher potential to accumulate organic forms. The organ specificity was evident for antioxidant response with a clear pattern of overall increase in gills and decrease in digestive gland. In addition, only gills displayed statistical correlations between oxidative stress responses and mercury accumulation. Besides the contribution to understand mercury toxicodynamics, specific organs approach is strongly recommended {{in order to avoid}} misinterpretations. The use of whole-body analyses can be particularly compromising when oxidative stress responses (rather than mercury accumulation) are addressed...|$|R
40|$|The central aims of {{this study}} were: (1) to {{construct}} age- and gender-specific percentiles for motor coordination (MC), (2) to analyze the change, stability, and prediction of MC, (3) to investigate the relationship between motor performance and body fatness, and (4) to evaluate the relationships between skeletal maturation and fundamental motor skills (FMS) and MC. The data collected was from the ‘Healthy Growth of Madeira Children Study’ and from the ‘Madeira Child Growth Study’. In these studies, MC, FMS, skeletal age, growth characteristics, motor performance, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and geographical area were assessed/measured. Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape, mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, multilevel models, and hierarchical regression (blocks) {{were some of the}} statistical procedures used in the analyses. Scores on walking backwards and moving sideways improved with age. It was also found that boys performed better than girls on moving sideways. Normal-weight children outperformed obese peers in almost all gross MC tests. <b>Inter-age</b> correlations were calculated to be between 0. 15 and 0. 60. Age was associated with a better performance in catching, scramble, speed run, standing long jump, balance, and tennis ball throwing. Body mass index was positively associated with scramble and speed run, and negatively related to the standing long jump. Physical activity was negatively associated with scramble. Semi-urban children displayed better catching skills relative to their urban peers. The standardized residual of skeletal age on chronological age (SAsr) and its interaction with stature and/or body mass accounted for the maximum of 7. 0 % of variance in FMS and MC over that attributed to body size per se. SAsr alone accounted for a maximum of 9. 0 % variance in FMS and MC over that attributed to body size per se and interactions between SAsr and body size. This study demonstrates the need to promote FMS, MC, motor performance, and physical activity in children...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{influenza}} {{is characterized}} by seasonal epidemics, caused by rapid viral adaptation to population immunity. Vaccination against influenza must be updated annually, following surveillance of newly appearing viral strains. During an influenza season, several strains may be co-circulating, which will influence their individual evolution; furthermore, selective forces acting on the strains will be mediated by the transmission dynamics in the population. Clearly, viral evolution and public health policy are strongly interconnected. Understanding population-level dynamics of coexisting viral influenza infections, would be of great benefit in designing vaccination strategies. Methods We use a Markov network to extend a previous homogeneous model of two co-circulating influenza viral strains by including vaccination (either prior to or during an outbreak), age structure, and heterogeneity of the contact network. We explore the effects of changes in vaccination rate, cross-immunity, and delay in appearance of the second strain, on the size and timing of infection peaks, attack rates, and disease-induced mortality rate; and compare the outcomes of the network and corresponding homogeneous models. Results Pre-vaccination {{is more effective than}} vaccination during an outbreak, resulting in lower attack rates for the first strain but higher attack rates for the second strain, until a “threshold” vaccination level of ~ 30 - 40 % is reached, after which attack rates due to both strains sharply dropped. A small increase in mortality was found for increasing pre-vaccination coverage below about 40 %, due to increasing numbers of strain 2 infections. The amount of cross-immunity present determines whether a second wave of infection will occur. Some {{significant differences were found between}} the homogeneous and network models, including timing and height of peak infection(s). Conclusions Contact and age structure significantly influence the propagation of disease in the population. The present model explores only qualitative behaviour, based on parameters derived for homogeneous influenza models, but may be used for realistic populations through statistical estimates of <b>inter-age</b> contact patterns. This could have significant implications for vaccination strategies in realistic models of populations in which more than one strain is circulating. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} results of {{measurements}} of the blood lipid spectrum of urban  residents of the European part of the Russian Federation. Material and methods. The results of single assessment of lipid profiles in 22, 436 males and 35, 100 females at the age from 13 to 94 years in 347 cities and towns  of the European part of the Russian Federation were analyzed. Lipid assays were performed by the Laboratory Service «HELIX» from 28 Jan 2015 to 19 Mar 2016. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, the analysis of distributions of sample comparisons and the search of dependencies. Results. Results of 56, 235 measurements of total cholesterol (TC), 22, 641 – triglycerides (TG), 21, 032 – high density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C) and 22, 441 – low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were analyzed. TC above 5. 2 mmol/l was identified in 55. 78 % samples; the proportion of people with LDL-C level above 3. 0 mmol/l was 62. 95 %. The level of TC was the highest {{at the age of}} 43 to 62 years in both men and women, while the peak in the increase in TC in men was approximately 10 years earlier, than  in women. In patients of older age groups, TC levels decreased and reached minimum values in men and women of senile age and long-livers. Low level of HDL-C was observed in 24. 46 % {{of the total number of}} samples in men and in 17. 68 % – in women. The monotonous increase in the average levels of HDL-C was revealed in men with aging. In women the HDL-C levels increased sharply from a minimum at the age of 13 years to a maximum at the age of 25 years with a slight monotonous decrease in the following age periods. However, even in the age older than 83 years levels of HDL-C remained high (1. 49 mmol/l in average). The level of TG showed significant <b>inter-age</b> fluctuations, especially in men. The levels of TG above 1. 7 mmol/l were recorded in 30. 07 % of all cases. Conclusion. Two-factor analysis of variance for all lipid parameters revealed a high statistical significance of gender and age. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the Leuven Growth Study of Belgian Boys {{the growth}} and {{physical}} performance of Belgian boys followed longitudinally between 12 and 19 years were studied. Subsequently, a subsample (n = 240) of Flemish-speaking males were reexamined at 30 and 35 years. A first question relates to the individual growth patterns {{in a variety of}} physical fitness characteristics. The three strength tests (static, functional, explosive) show curves that are qualitatively similar to those for height and weight. Their adolescent spurts occur after the height spurt. Flexibility and the two speed tests appear to reach maximum velocities prior to the height and weight spurts. Longitudinal principal component analysis was applied to the study of growth patterns of several somatic and motor characteristics. The results for height show three components sufficient to provide an adequate representation of the original information. The first component characterizes the general position of an individual growth curve. Components 2 and 3 reflect fluctuation in percentile level during the age period studied and can be conceived as indices of stability and are related to age at peak height velocity (APHV) and peak height velocity (PHV), respectively. Relationships between somatic characteristics, physical performance, and APHV have been studied in a sample of 173 Flemish boys, measured yearly between +/- 13 and +/- 18 years and again as adults at 30 years of age. The sample was divided into three contrasting maturity categories based on the APHV. There are consistent differences among boys of contrasting maturity status during adolescence in body weight, skeletal lengths and breadths, circumferences, and skinfolds on the trunk. There are no differences in skinfolds on the extremities. None of the differences in somatic dimensions and ratios among the three contrasting maturity groups are significant at 30 years of age except those for subscapular skinfold and the trunk/extremity skinfold ratio. During adolescence, speed of limb movement, explosive strength and static strength are negatively related to APHV; thus, early maturers performed better than late maturers. However, between late adolescence and adulthood (30 years), the late maturers not only caught up to the early maturers, but there were significant differences for explosive strength and functional strength in favor of late maturers. Finally, age-specific tracking, using <b>inter-age</b> correlations, of adult health- and performance-related fitness scores were investigated. In addition, the independent contribution of adolescent physical characteristics to the explanation of adult fitness scores was also studied. Tracking between age 13 and age 30 years was moderately high (46 % of variance explained) for flexibility, low to moderate (between 19 % and 27 % of variance explained) for the other fitness parameters and low for pulse recovery and static strength (7 % to 11 % of variance explained). Between age 18 and age 30 years the tracking was high for flexibility, moderately high for explosive and static strength, and moderate for the other fitness parameters except for pulse recovery. The amount of variance of adult fitness levels explained increased significantly when other characteristics observed during adolescence entered the regressions or discriminant functions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the dissection and characterisation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting production traits in sheep. Firstly, {{the association between}} specific genetic polymorphisms and complex variation in weight, muscle and fat depositions was investigated. Research concentrated on assessing the presence, correspondence and significance of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GDF 8 region of ovine chromosome 2, reportedly affecting muscle production. Commercial populations of British Texel, Suffolk and Charollais sheep were studied. The SNPs were absent in Suffolk and almost fixed in Texel breeds. In the Charollais population, the SNPs segregated at intermediate frequencies and a significant association was found between these polymorphisms and muscle depth. The previously proposed causative allele {{at one of the}} loci resulted in increased muscle depth and, at allele frequency of 0. 5, this locus would explain one third of the additive genetic variance for the trait. Partial recessive allelic expression is proposed by genotypic value predictions and is consistent with the previously postulated molecular mechanism by which it gives rise to muscle changes. Secondly, the thesis focused on detection of QTL associated with growth. Live weight is a composite of growth rates over time, with <b>inter-age</b> genetic correlations for live weight decreasing as time between weight measurements increases. To explore whether observed genetic correlation patterns translate into distinct loci acting on weight at different growth stages, a novel method was developed and the applicability of a second proposed method was explored. Both methods allowed simultaneous analysis of multiple live weights per animal, while accounting differently for the correlation among measurements ordered in time. In the first approach, a growth curve technique was developed and employed to map growth QTL for curve parameters and predicted growth descriptors. A study of actual live weights identified significant QTL at different ages on distinct chromosomes, with QTL significance and variance changing over time. Further application of this technique on a simulated dataset validated its effectiveness in detecting age-dependent QTL. An extension of the procedure resulted in a novel technique for genomic evaluation of longitudinal traits. In the second method examined, random regression (RR) models were applied for dissection of growth QTL. Systematic model selection and inclusion of relevant random effects resulted in apparently significant QTL, but the method was computationally demanding, model choice proved challenging and the results were questioned. To further explore the method, RR models were applied to various simulated growth phenotypes composed of time-dependent QTL trajectories, polygenic and environmental effects. Statistically optimal RR models succeeded in identifying significant QTL and predicting the simulated time-dependence for most scenarios. However, the issue of model choice was again prominent, as suboptimal models resulted in unreliable QTL variance trajectories and pronounced confounding between different time-dependent effects. Thus, the growth curve approach appeared to be the more flexible and robust process for analysing longitudinal data to map agedependent QTL.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the <b>inter-age</b> perception of homosexuality in Vrchlabí and its nearest neighbourhood. The thesis focuses on three main age categories: young adults (18 - 30), middle age (31 - 64) and seniors (65 +). The theoretical part is divided into five main chapters. In the opening chapter the concept of homosexuality and other related terms is defined. The next part {{deals with the}} coming out, clarifies its process and specifies its particular phases. The following chapter offers a short view {{of the history of}} homosexuality and its transformations during the time since the middle age, across the medieval prosecution, till the 1990 ?s ? time of decriminalisation of homosexuality and the beginnings of public enlightenment for the homosexual minority. The chapter Nr. 4 helps to understand homosexuality in a biblical context and deals with theological stance towards homosexual minority and last but not least with the stance of the Church. The last part concentrates on homosexuality within the purview of the legislation of the Czech Republic and offers a short look at the process of decriminalisation, question of discrimination, civil partnership and the possibility of adopting children by homosexual couples. In the empiric part are evaluated the results of the survey, that investigated the level of awareness of homosexuals and the level of tolerance towards the homosexual minority. The method of the quantitative research was the questioning. The anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 150 respondents, returned were 84, 6 % (127). The respondents were selected and questioned in local restaurant, manufacture, grammar school and retirement home. The reason for this selection was trying to find the widest possible spectrum of respondents from many points of view (identification). The aim of this thesis was to find out, how the younger generation perceives homosexuality compared to the perception of the older generations and seniors in Vrchlabí. The partial aim was to investigate, how well is the society informed about this problem, where the people get their information about this topic and whether they are well or ill-disposed to the other emerging questions about homosexuality. The issue of knowledge showed a strong influence of the media. However the school environment can be defined as not stimulating in the question of dealing with homosexuality. In connection with the aim of this thesis was proved the veracity of the hypothesis H 1 which assumed that the younger generation is more tolerant to homosexuality than the older generation and seniors. Younger respondents have shown higher level of tolerance than seniors. The hypothesis H 2 which presumed that seniors perceive homosexuality as a disease or deviation was confirmed just partially. The study states that homosexuality is mostly considered as a mental disorder by seniors, yet it is only 16 % of the questioned seniors. Because of this fact the hypothesis H 2 cannot be with certainty confirmed...|$|R
