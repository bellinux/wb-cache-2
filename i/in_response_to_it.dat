5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E

Rousseau and D'Alembert managed to maintain their friendship after the response, though somewhat at a distance.

500|$|This {{novel was}} widely popular {{and led to}} García Márquez's Nobel Prize {{as well as the}} Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972. William Kennedy has called it [...] "the first piece of {{literature}} since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race," [...] and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: [...] "Most critics don't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude {{is a bit of a}} joke, full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she {{stepped on the}} train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E

[...] However, this does not make Palestinian identity any less legitimate: [...] "The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> does {{not in any way}} diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism.

Ultimately, only the steel structures (excluding the Horonai shaft) have been erased, but the concrete structures remained standing in the landscape. The city of Mikasa built a railway museum on the access road to the mining site. However, this museum could not replace the income from the mining activities, and the city balanced {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy. These events forced the regional government of Sorachi to adjust its regeneration policy. So it proclaimed in 1998 the [...] "Law for the Examination of Mining Heritage," [...] (炭鉱の記憶調査事業, Tankō no Kioku Chōsa Jigyō) which supported the enhancement of regional material and immaterial heritage. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> professor Hirotaka Yoshioka (吉岡宏高) promoted the valorisation of the mining heritage of Mikasa by organizing heritage walks {{at the site of the}} mine Horonai, which resulted in the establishment of the landscape park of the coal mine Horonai (幌内炭鉱景観公園, Horonai Tankō Keikan Kōen).|$|E
