40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{investigate}} how <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV irradiances vary with glass thickness, lamination of the glass {{and the effect of}} SZA, and to measure the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV exposures to different receiving planes with a newly developed UVA dosimeter. Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by the glass thickness and the solar zenith angle (SZA). The laminated glass transmitted 11 to 12 % and the windscreen glass transmitted 2. 5 to 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for the thicker glass than it was for the thinner glass. The change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was negligible influence due to the SZA on the glass transmitted UV of the laminated and windscreen glass. The influence of the glass thickness in the range of 2 mm to 6 mm on the percentage transmission was less than 16 %. The influences of the glass thickness and the SZA on the glass transmitted UV have been incorporated in the use of a UVA dosimeter for the glass transmitted UV exposures. The UVA dosimeter was employed in the field to measure the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV exposures to different receiving planes. The UVA dosimeter reported has the potential for personal solar UVA exposure measurements...|$|R

50|$|To reduce unintentional {{ultraviolet}} (UV) exposure, and {{to contain}} hot bulb fragments {{in the event}} of explosive bulb failure, general-purpose lamps usually have a UV-absorbing <b>glass</b> <b>filter</b> over or around the bulb. Alternatively, lamp bulbs may be doped or coated to filter out the UV radiation. With adequate filtering, a halogen lamp exposes users to less UV than a standard incandescent lamp producing the same effective level of illumination without filtering.|$|E

40|$|We {{have been}} {{practicing}} spectral color estimation for museum artwork imaging and spectral estimation. We have had success using both narrow-band imaging {{based on a}} {{liquid crystal tunable filter}} (LCTF) and various broad-band imaging approaches using the same monochromatic digital camera system. Details about our spectral color imaging system description, imaging procedures and the performance of spectral estimation methods used can be found in our previous technical reports. 1, 2 In previous reports we focused in methods of reconstruction from narrow-band images using LCTF, while we only reported preliminary analyses of reconstruction from wide-band images using six <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> images and a red-green-blue filter combined with and without a light-blue Wratten filter.

The performance of this new configuration is compared to the imaging using all six filters of the filter wheel, as well as the configuration using six channels derived from red-green-blue filters without and with absorption filter...|$|R
