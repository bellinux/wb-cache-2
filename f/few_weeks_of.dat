5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
50|$|For almost 40 years NTC {{has hosted}} the Didsbury Lectures, which was inaugurated by F. F. Bruce in 1979. These lectures last for four nights, and usually {{occur in the}} final <b>few</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> October.|$|R

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn {{made it difficult}} for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> exposure. Only {{about a third of}} lead is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead.|$|E
5|$|Miz {{was drafted}} from SmackDown! to ECW on June 17, 2007, {{as part of}} the 2007 {{supplemental}} draft. He was absent from the first <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> ECW, though he was the subject of backstage mentions between matches and had several short Miz TV Crashes ECW video segments. He made his debut on the July 10 episode of ECW in a match against Nunzio, which he won.|$|E
50|$|The July Revolution, {{which brought}} his party into power, only {{led to a}} very {{temporary}} resumption of office by Bignon. He was for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> minister <b>of</b> foreign affairs in the first government of Louis Philippe, and again for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> minister <b>of</b> public instruction. But {{the idea of making}} him responsible for the foreign policy of France could not be realized owing to the necessity under which Louis Philippe lay of courting the goodwill of the powers, whom Bignon had offended by his outspoken writings.|$|R

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} for the first <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the tour, {{as he struggled to}} adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project was {{replaced}} by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked to spend a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.|$|E
5|$|After a {{knee injury}} due to an {{accident}} with a scooter and a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> required rest and adjusted training, Van Dijk won a stage in the Energiewacht Tour; {{because she did not}} earn enough bonus seconds during the tour she finished second in the general classification. Van Dijk also won the individual time trial and the road race in the Omloop van Borsele. A few days later she started in the Gracia-Orlova, where she won the prologue and a stage and helped her teammate Evelyn Stevens to win the general classification. Back in the Netherlands, in Emmen, she became the Dutch time trial champion in the elite category {{for the second time in}} her career.|$|E

5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford slipped out of the play-off places in the final <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the season, finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near {{the end of his life}} Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars.

5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by {{one point in the}} NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the first <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, {{forced out of the}} group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} {{different}} positions, but in 2007–08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the season.|$|E
