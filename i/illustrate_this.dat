5|$|Following {{the success}} of Terang Boelan (1937; based on The Jungle Princess), the {{domestic}} movie-making industry began to model their productions after Hollywood works, as this was expected to ensure financial success. The Indonesian film scholars Ekky Imanjaya and Said Salim write that Kedok Ketawa was influenced by Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula through its Hollywood adaptations. Neither writer gives comparisons to <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> influence.|$|E

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Outside of London and the South East, {{the use of}} {{regional}} airports has increased dramatically in recent years, {{with the amount of}} air traffic using these facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005. To <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> growth, in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter International Airport, Bristol International Airport, and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent, 113 per cent, and 60 per cent respectively. In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth, with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent, and those of Gatwick increasing by less than 10 per cent.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, the {{requirement}} that the action integral be stationary under small perturbations of the evolution is equivalent {{to a set of}} differential equations (called the Euler–Lagrange equations) that may be determined using the calculus of variations.

25|$|The {{next stage}} {{took place during}} the Babylonian captivity. The {{destruction}} of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylon in 586BC and the end of kingship was the occasion of much reflection and theological speculation among the Deuteronomistic elite, now in exile in the city of Babylon. They explained the disaster as Yahweh's punishment of their failure to follow the law, and created a history of Israel (the books of Joshua through Kings) to <b>illustrate</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Civil Code also {{states that}} {{children}} {{as the result}} of the marriage will take the mother's middle name (maiden surname) and the father's surname. To <b>illustrate</b> <b>this,</b> the children of a married couple named Maria Josefa Lopez Mañego-Luansing and Juan Candido Luansing will take the middle name Mañego and the surname Luansing, so, one daughter with a given name of Juliana will be named Juliana Mañego Luansing.|$|E
25|$|To <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> point, Chomsky {{created the}} {{nonsensical}} sentence in (1), {{which does not}} occur in any corpus, is not meaningful, and is not statistically probable. However, the form of this sentence is judged to be grammatical by many native speakers of English. Such grammaticality judgements {{reflect the fact that}} the structure of sentence (1) obeys the rules of English grammar. This can be seen by comparing sentence (1) with sentence (2). Both sentences have the same structure, and both are grammatically well-formed.|$|E
25|$|Modern Roman Catholic {{immigrants}} {{come to the}} United States {{from the}} Philippines, Poland, and Latin America, especially from Mexico. This multiculturalism and diversity has greatly impacted the flavor of Catholicism in the United States. For example, many dioceses serve in both the English language and the Spanish language. Also, when many parishes were {{set up in the}} United States, separate churches were built for parishioners from Ireland, Germany, Italy, etc. In Iowa, the development of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, the work of Bishop Loras and the building of St. Raphael's Cathedral <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> point.|$|E

25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch {{in front of the}} cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and {{it is clear that the}} coin is being jumped.|$|E
25|$|Ledoux, who was {{eventually}} released, ceased building {{and attempted to}} prepare {{the publication of his}} complete œuvre. Since 1773, he had started to engrave his constructions and his projects but, because of the evolution of his style, he did not cease retouching his drawings, and the engravers constantly had to redo their boards. Ledoux evolved towards an architecture always more detailed and colossal, with vast walls that were increasingly smooth, and with increasingly rare openings. The differences between a drawing of the Pavillon de Louveciennes as it first was, made by the British architect Sir William Chambers and the engraving that was published in 1804 <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> process.|$|E
25|$|To <b>illustrate</b> <b>this</b> relationship, Giddens {{discusses}} changing {{attitudes towards}} marriage in developed countries. He claims that {{any effort to}} explain this phenomenon solely in terms of micro or macro level causes {{will result in a}} circular cause and consequence. Social relationships and visible sexuality (micro-level change) are related to the decline of religion and the rise of rationality (macro-level change), but also with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro), change caused by different practices and changing attitudes on the level of everyday lives (micro). Practices and attitudes in turn can be affected by social movements (for example, women's liberation and egalitarianism), a macro-scale phenomena; but the movements usually grow out of everyday life grievances — a micro-scale phenomenon.|$|E
