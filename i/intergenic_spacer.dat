Genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates consist of the isochores, relatively homogenous regions differing in GC content [reviewed in (1 – 4) ]. There are various hypotheses explaining the appearance of isochores. The main controversy is mutation bias (in a broad sense, including repair bias and biased gene conversion) versus selection (5 – 13). One selectionist explanation suggests that selection was for the increase of thermostability of DNA helix (caused by GCenrichment) in certain genomic regions as a result of adaptation to elevated temperature in warm-blooded vertebrates (2, 14). Another hypothesis implies that there was an optimization of physical properties of DNA molecule for active transcription in the GC-rich regions and for gene suppression in the GC-poor regions in the more complexly organized vertebrates (‘epigenetic optimization’...|$|R

In nonhybrid Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that a class of 45 S rRNA gene variants that is normally inactivated during development fails to be silenced in hda 6 mutants. In these mutants, symmetric cytosine methylation at CG and CHG motifs is reduced, and spurious RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription occurs throughout the <b>intergenic</b> <b>spacers.</b> The resulting sense and antisense spacer transcripts facilitate a massive overproduction of siRNAs that, in turn, direct de novo cytosine methylation of corresponding gene sequences. However, the resulting de novo DNA methylation fails to suppress Pol I or Pol II transcription {{in the absence of}} HDA 6 activity; instead, euchromatic histone modifications typical of active genes accumulate. Collectively, the data reveal a futile cycle of unregulated transcription, siRNA production, and siRNA-directed DNA methylation in the absence of HDA 6 -mediated histone deacetylation.

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge {{of animal}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes {{is very important}} to understand their molecular evolution as well as for phylogenetic and population genetic studies. The Lepidoptera encompasses more than 160, 000 described species {{and is one of the}} largest insect orders. To date only nine lepidopteran mitochondrial DNAs have been fully and two others partly sequenced. Furthermore the taxon sampling is very scant. Thus advance of lepidopteran mitogenomics deeply requires new genomes derived from a broad taxon sampling. In present work we describe the mitochondrial genome of the moth Ochrogaster lunifer. Results The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer is a circular molecule 15593 bp long. It includes the entire set of 37 genes usually present in animal mitochondrial genomes. It contains also 7 <b>intergenic</b> <b>spacers.</b> The gene order of the newly sequenced genome is that typical for Lepidoptera and differs from the insect ancestral type for the placement of trnM. The 77. 84 % A+T content of its α strand is the lowest among known lepidopteran genomes. The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer exhibits one of the most marked C-skew among available insect Pterygota genomes. The protein-coding genes have typical mitochondrial start codons except for cox 1 that present an unusual CGA. The O. lunifer genome exhibits the less biased synonymous codon usage among lepidopterans. Comparative genomics analysis study identified atp 6, cox 1, cox 2 as cox 3, cob, nad 1, nad 2, nad 4, and nad 5 as potential markers for population genetics/phylogenetics studies. A peculiar feature of O. lunifer mitochondrial genome it that the <b>intergenic</b> <b>spacers</b> are mostly made by repetitive sequences. Conclusion The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer is the first representative of superfamily Noctuoidea that account for about 40 % of all described Lepidoptera. New genome shares many features with other known lepidopteran genomes. It differs however for its low A+T content and marked C-skew. Compared to other lepidopteran genomes it is less biased in synonymous codon usage. Comparative evolutionary analysis of lepidopteran mitochondrial genomes allowed the identification of previously neglected coding genes as potential phylogenetic markers. Presence of repetitive elements in <b>intergenic</b> <b>spacers</b> of O. lunifer genome supports the role of DNA slippage as possible mechanism to produce spacers during replication. </p...|$|R

Studies to find their evolutionary relationship using chloroplast (RuBisCO gene) or mitochondrial DNA (<b>intergenic</b> <b>spacer)</b> sequence markers have been inconclusive. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers (short DNA sequences) suggests that a divergence between the two species occurred between 125 and 2475 years ago with a posterior distribution peak at around 400 years ago. This means the species would have diverged more recently than the transition of the Baltic Sea from a marine environment to its present brackish state. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that F. radicans is found nowhere else other than the Baltic.|$|E
50|$|Sequence-based identification.Historically, DNA-DNA {{hybridization}} {{studies have}} been used to confirm species level identifications for the VGS. However, these procedures are not practical for clinical laboratories to use for identification of these organisms. Other sequence-based identification systems have subsequently been introduced for VGS species level identification. In general, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results in poor resolution to species level in the VGS. This is due to the high degree of 16S rRNA gene homology in this group of organisms; S. mitis, S. oralis, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae almost always have >99% sequence homology in this gene. In light of the high degree of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, sequencing of alternative gene targets for reliable identification to the species level has been explored. One promising target, rnpB, was explored by Innings et al., who analyzed 2 variable regions of rnpB by pyrosequencing (28). Of the 43 species analyzed, all were identified to species level, except for 2 isolates: S. anginosus/S. constellatus and S. infantis/S. peroris. rnpB can be used for identification of VGS with high-level resolution. One other successful approach is sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene, described by Poyart et al. This technique was used to accurately differentiate over 29 streptococcal species, including 16 VGS species, with clear differentiation of S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae (44, 45). Other techniques that have been used, with various degrees of success, are sequence analysis of the 16S-23S <b>intergenic</b> <b>spacer</b> region, d-alanine-d-alanine ligase gene sequencing, and hyaluronate lyase gene sequencing.|$|E
