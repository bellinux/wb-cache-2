5|$|Despite his {{military}} supremacy over land, Simeon <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he needed naval assistance {{in order to}} seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E

Tim Walker {{wrote in the}} Sunday Telegraph: [...] "It is a great big empty vessel of a show that {{makes a lot of}} noise and not much else, and would have been better entitled 'Irredeemably Bland'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> for the whole of the two hours and 25 minutes that it ran, I was sitting among a group of people with vacant smiles on faces that otherwise seemed entirely numbed. That was how I looked, too. It is the expression that registers when what one is seeing doesn't entirely sync with {{what is going on in}} one's brain." [...] Quentin Letts wrote for Daily Mail, [...] "It is pink not just in the colour of many of the clothes and stage effects. It is pink to the core of its little, tiny soul ... The plot is pap, the musical unmemorable, the dancing often hefty except for one routine with skipping ropes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:Dear Sztójay: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is {{the handling of the}} Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. As such, I was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken {{out of the hands of}} Deputy Minister László Endre. Further more, László Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.Just before the deportations began, two Slovakian Jewish prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the Vrba-Wetzler Report, was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials. Details from the report were broadcast by the BBC on 15 June and printed in The New York Times on 20 June. World leaders, including Pope Pius XII (25 June), President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 June, and King Gustaf V of Sweden on 30 June, subsequently pleaded with Horthy to use his influence to stop the deportations. Roosevelt specifically threatened military retaliation if the transports were not ceased. On 2 July, Allied bombers executed the heaviest bombings inflicted on Hungary during the war. Hungarian radio accused Jews of guiding the bombers to their targets with radio transmissions and light signals, but on 7 July Horthy at last ordered the transports halted. [...] By that time, 437,000 Jews had been sent to Auschwitz, most of them to their deaths. Horthy was informed about the number of the deported Jews some days later: [...] "approximately 400,000". By many estimates, one of every three people murdered at Auschwitz during its operation was a Hungarian Jew killed between May and July 1944.|$|E
