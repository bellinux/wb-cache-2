5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health.

5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the Senate was {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> began as a severe cold and which threatened him {{with the loss of}} his left eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{animated}} and personable nature {{made her}} {{popular with the}} Dutch people, and her marriage to a Protestant prince was popular in Britain. She was devoted to her husband, but he was often away on campaigns, which led to Mary's family supposing him to be cold and neglectful. Within months of the marriage Mary was pregnant; however, {{on a visit to}} her husband at the fortified city of Breda, she suffered a miscarriage, which may have permanently impaired her ability to have children. She suffered further bouts of <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> may have been miscarriages in mid-1678, early 1679, and early 1680.

Rachel sets Delphine the task of convincing Professor Ethan Duncan—a founding scientist of the clone program and Rachel's adoptive father—to come into Dyad to help find a cure for the <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> has befallen Cosima Niehaus, another clone. When Ethan arrives, Rachel questions him about why she cannot reproduce, and he reveals that all of the clones were intended to be infertile by design.

5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration {{of certain}} individuals {{was prompted by}} their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated in part by the death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> ultimately killed Hatton. Now embarrassed by the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E

5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Józef {{received}} a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka. While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski {{was held for}} several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: {{after one of the}} inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.|$|E
5|$|Mary's son by Darnley, James, {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the {{breakdown}} of her marriage. In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers. The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced {{at the time and}} Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards. Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious <b>illness</b> <b>that</b> included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of unconsciousness. She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians. The cause of her illness is unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress, haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer, and porphyria.|$|E
