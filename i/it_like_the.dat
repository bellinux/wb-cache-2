Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music video, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market the cassette, in a profit participation agreement.|$|E
5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition.|$|E

25|$|In late 1920, Handley Page started {{design of}} a new single-seat torpedo bomber to meet the {{requirements}} of Air Ministry Specification 3/20 for a carrier-based aircraft to replace the Sopwith Cuckoo, in competition with the Blackburn Dart. The resulting design, the Type T, (later known as the H.P.19) and named the Hanley was a single-engine biplane of wooden construction. <b>It,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Dart, was powered by a Napier Lion engine and had a crew of one. It had folding three-bay wings which were fitted with full-span leading edge slots on both upper and lower wings in order to improve low-speed handling.|$|E

25|$|It was {{established}} in the 1880s by the nephews of Matthew Vassar, founder of Vassar College, as a home for elderly men but was not fully occupied until the early 20th century. It continued in that use for most of the century, and was among the first buildings in the city listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Later that year it also became a contributing property to the Mill Street-North Clover Street Historic District. Today <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Institute building, is owned by a local arts group, which rents some of the space in the building to other local non-profit organizations.|$|E

Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, {{at the southern end of}} the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the prothesis. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.|$|E

25|$|The Thunderbird's fifth {{generation}} {{brought the}} second major change in the car's design direction since its debut in 1955. From 1958 to 1966, the Thunderbird had remained fundamentally the same in concept as a sporty two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. However, {{the introduction of the}} Ford Mustang in early 1964 had created a challenge to the Thunderbird's market positioning for <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Thunderbird, was also a two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. Where the Mustang had an advantage was in the point that it was substantially cheaper. To prevent overlap between the two cars, Ford's response was to move the Thunderbird upmarket. The result, introduced for 1967, was a larger Thunderbird with luxury appointments more in line with a Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Engineer William Rich Hutton was {{instrumental}} in getting the inclined plane built. Starting in 1875, a canal inclined plane was built two miles (3km) upriver from Georgetown, so that boats whose destination was downriver from Washington could bypass the congestion (and price gouging of independent wharf owners) in Georgetown. Originally the company planned to build a river lock, but then discovered that such a lock occasionally would consume more water than the level could provide. They then planned to make an inclined plane, much like the Morris Canal. The first boat went through in 1876; 1918 boats used the inclined plane that first year. Usage reports conflict: Hahn reports that was only really used for two years, and sporadically in 1889, yet Skramstad reports that due to flood damage in 1880 to the Rock Creek outlet, any boat until 1889 (when another flood wrecked the canal) going further down the Potomac than Georgetown, {{had to use the}} inclined plane. Although Hahn says it was the largest inclined plane in the world at that time, it was 600 feet long, which is short compared to Plane 9 West of the Morris Canal at 1,500 feet. It originally used a turbine to power <b>it</b> (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> Morris Canal) but was later switched to use steam power.|$|E
