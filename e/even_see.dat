25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and <b>even</b> <b>see</b> the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E

25|$|Lucario is a canid-like Pokémon {{that is a}} bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws, {{while its}} chest and the {{exterior}} of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, thighs shaped like baggy shorts, and four small appendages {{on the back of}} its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur that is slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. Lucario has the ability to sense and manipulate , a form of energy emitted by all living things, and is able to understand human speech. As a result, Lucario can read the thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, {{to the point that it}} can <b>even</b> <b>see</b> otherwise invisible foes. When properly trained, it can identify the feelings of others even if they are over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, a baby Pokémon that is also able to sense Aura. Compared to Lucario, Riolu is a pure Fighting-type Pokémon, rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon, and it cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario.|$|E

500|$|When {{faced with}} the double burden of {{having to deal with}} the {{responsibilities}} of both a career as well as domestic duties, sometimes a person's health is affected. Many people {{faced with the}}se circumstances have a higher chance of being sick since health and stress seem to be correlated, as stress has been implicated in up to eighty percent of all illnesses, as found by a report done by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. In an article that was written by a team of researchers it was found that both men and women faced with a [...] "spillover" [...] of work and family issues were 1.5-1.6 {{times more likely to have}} an absence due to sickness than others.

500|$|Halley's 1986 {{apparition}} was {{the least}} favorable on record. The comet and Earth were {{on opposite sides of}} the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley's closest approach was 0.42 AU. [...] Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to <b>even</b> <b>see</b> the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera. The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built 24-inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg (then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.|$|E

500|$|On the {{specific}} recommendation of Lord Hood, who had offered {{the young man}} his personal patronage, Heywood resumed his naval career as a midshipman aboard his uncle Thomas Pasley's ship [...] In September 1793 he was summoned by Lord Howe, commander of the Channel Fleet, to serve on , the fleet's flagship. Hough observes that a pardon, followed by promotion, for one of Bligh's chief targets was [...] "a public rebuke to the absent captain, and everyone recognised it as such". Although Bligh had departed on his second breadfruit expedition in August 1791 as a national hero, the court martial had revealed damaging evidence of his erratic and overbearing behaviour. The families of Heywood and Christian, noting the leniency that had acquitted four and pardoned three of the ten accused, began their own campaigns for vindication, and for revenge on Bligh. When Bligh returned in August 1793 he found that opinion had turned sharply against him. Lord Chatham, at the Admiralty, refused to receive his report or <b>even</b> <b>see</b> him—although Nathaniel Portlock, Bligh's lieutenant, was given a meeting. Bligh was then left unemployed, on half-pay, for 19months before his next assignment.|$|E
500|$|Jaws {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it}} [...] "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works {{all the better}} because it's populated with characters {{that have been developed}} into human beings". Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't <b>even</b> <b>see</b> the shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or <b>even</b> <b>see</b> a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They are bound to be American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates the ways they have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not quite in body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but now looking at things from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} <b>even</b> <b>see</b> her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E
