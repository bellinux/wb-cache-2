5|$|Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) shows Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to {{a garden}} that Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) has started. Kate discovers that Sun speaks English {{when the two}} are working in the garden, and Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's compass, north <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> it should be, causing him to believe that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E

25|$|Chiggers {{attach to}} the host, pierce the skin, inject enzymes into the bite wound that digest {{cellular}} contents, and then suck up the digested tissue through a tube formed by hardened skin cells called a stylostome. They do not burrow into the skin or suck blood, as is commonly assumed. Itching from a chigger bite may not develop until 24–48 hours after the bite, so the victim may not associate the specific exposure with the bite itself. The red welt/bump on the skin <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> a chigger laid eggs, as is sometimes believed. The larva remains attached to a suitable host for {{three to five days}} before dropping off to begin its nymphal stage. They tend to attach where clothing have restrictions, such as belt lines, or behind the knees when wearing jeans.|$|E

25|$|The {{lines that}} {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark {{in the center of each}} baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Julianne Moore would guest star on 30 Rock as a love interest for Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Moore would later guest star in the episodes [...] "Winter Madness", [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", and [...] "I Do Do". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. [...] "As we move into the back half of the season, we'd like to get [...] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles." [...] In the same interview, Baldwin noted, [...] "Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> I'd like him to end up." [...] Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says [...] "shark farts", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term [...] "was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oeroeg (translated into English as [...] "The Black Lake") is {{the first}} novel by Hella Haasse. First {{published}} anonymously in 1948, it {{has become one of}} the best-known Dutch novels and a staple of literary education for many Dutch school children. The novel, a Bildungsroman, is set in the Dutch East Indies, and tells the story of an anonymous narrator growing up on a plantation in the Dutch colony West Java. His childhood friend is a boy of the same age, but of native descent. As the narrator grows up he finds himself becoming estranged from his friend, as a result of the political and racial circumstances of colonial life. After having served in the army during World War II, he returns to his native land, only to be told that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> he belongs, and that he must leave.|$|E
2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change." [...] Axelrod criticized the Clinton campaign's positioning by saying that [...] "being the consummate Washington insider <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> {{you want to be}} in a year when people want change... initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands." [...] The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. [...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become." [...] In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.|$|E

60|$|It must {{certainly}} {{therefore be}} a most useful undertaking {{to give the}} true history of this Tyrant of the air, this God of the world, this terror and aversion of mankind, which we call Devil; to shew what he IS, and what he <b>IS</b> <b>NOT,</b> <b>where</b> he IS, and where he IS NOT, when he is IN US, and when he IS NOT; for I cannot doubt but that the Devil is really and bona fide in {{a great many of}} our honest weak-headed friends, when they themselves know nothing of the matter.|$|E

How, for instance, in the upper cirri, a thousand little chills, alternating with a thousand little warmths, could stand still as a thousand little feathers.|$|E

While she had trusted me in the trance--trusted me because her spirit was then free to recognize my spirit--the writing had remained on the page.

6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is a}} good side to the Englishman's day-dream of leisure, and one which the American spirit tends to miss. It may be {{expressed}} in the word 'holiday' or still better in the word 'hobby.' The Englishman, in his character of Robin Hood, really has got two strings to his bow. Indeed the Englishman really is well represented by Robin Hood; for there is always something about him that may literally be called outlawed, in the sense of being extra-legal or outside the rules. A Frenchman said of Browning that his centre was not in the middle; and it may be said of many an Englishman that his heart <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> his treasure is.

He was thought to have a human shape, at one time, by some theorists: no doubt exists on that head. That, however, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>where</b> we demur. We demur when, because an hallucination of the Witch of Endor (probably still incompletely developed) is called by her Elohim, therefore the highest Elohim is said by Mr. Huxley to differ from a ghost only in degree, not in kind. Elohim, or El, the creative, differs from a ghost in kind, because he, in Hebrew belief, never was a ghost, he is immortal and without beginning.|$|E
