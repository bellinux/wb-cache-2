Meanwhile, Johnson's wife Shelley is having an affair with Briggs; she shows him Johnson's bloodstained shirt. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it,</b> promising to rid them of Johnson for good.|$|E
5|$|When Flanders {{finds out}} that the {{children}} were not baptized, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> upon himself to give the kids an emergency baptism. When Homer and Marge are declared decent parents, they quickly head for the Springfield River to stop Flanders. Just as Flanders is about to pour holy water on Bart, Homer shoves Bart over to prevent the water from hitting him. The Simpson family is reunited, and they head home together.|$|E
5|$|On a {{beach in}} Côte d'Ivoire, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered by Solomon Merkmallen, a biology professor. When <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> to his office and places it together with a similar artifact, the two suddenly fuse and fly across the room, becoming embedded in a Bible. Merkmallen then travels to the U.S. to meet with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third artifact. However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.|$|E
60|$|She {{took up his}} hold-all, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> from her; {{she took}} his bag, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> from her; then they {{went out to the}} T-cart. A small groom stood there, holding a silver-roan cob with a black mane and black swish tail.|$|R
50|$|In law, avowry {{is where}} one takes a {{distress}} for rent or other thing, {{and the other}} sues replevin. In which case the taker shall justify, in his plea, for what cause <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it,</b> and if <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> in his own right, is to show it, and so avow the taking - which is called his avowry. If <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> in the right of another, when he has shown the cause, he is to make conusance of the taking, as being a bailiff or servant to him in whose right he did it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> flesh, therefore, {{because the}} {{children}} had it; <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> that <b>he</b> might die for the children; <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> that <b>he</b> might deliver the children from {{the works of the}} devil--'that he might deliver them.' No deliverance had come to the children if the Son of God had not taken their flesh and blood; therefore <b>he</b> <b>took</b> our flesh, that he might be our Saviour.|$|R
25|$|With extreme sarcasm, Muratori ridicules {{not only}} {{the subject of the}} book, but also the style as well. Granting Kenney stylistic ability, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> to a level of sarcasm by {{comparing}} Orrery to a display of fireworks. It is overly bombastic in opinion because of its briefness. Were he able to write more and include more analytic evidence, this review might not be a bad source for negative criticism.|$|E
25|$|Flushed with victory, {{the knight}} kneels and renders thanks to heaven. Seeing the moon, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> for his Dulcinea {{and tries to}} get to her. As he {{approaches}} the windmills {{he can see the}} moon no longer and thinks that evil magicians have hidden his beloved mistress. So, spear in hand, he tilts at the wings of the windmill, which he mistakes for a giant. Alas, the knight is caught by one of the wings and flung into the air. He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{after his}} own feature's demise, Aquaman is briefly made {{the leader of}} the Justice League of America. In a storyline in Justice League of America #228–230, an {{invasion}} of Earth by a race of Martians occurs {{at a time when the}} core members are missing. Aquaman is thus forced to defend Earth with a League much-depleted in power and capability, and <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> upon himself to disband the Justice League altogether in Justice League of America Annual #2 (1984), thereafter reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full participation to the League's cases.|$|E

25|$|On the 'ava cup being {{presented}} to a chief <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> {{in his right}} hand and after a moment's pause, he spills a few drops onto {{the floor of the house}} on his right side at the same time speaking a few words in a low tone. Today these words have some Christian significance but in olden times were no doubt a form of prayer to one of the numerous gods. He then raises the cup and says Ia manuia which means be happy or prosperous. He then drinks a varying quantity of the 'ava and throws any remainder over his shoulder. He then hands the cup back to the tautu'ava who steps forward and returns to the refill the cup. Should the person served not desire to drink the 'ava he may take a mouthful and then spew it out, or he may merely touch the cup held in the hand of the bearer or he may take hold of the cup and holding it out in front of him address a few remarks to the assembly, finally exclaiming Ia manuia.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E
25|$|Fred {{comes down}} with an illness and is cured by Mr. Lydgate, the newest doctor in Middlemarch. Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks {{to make a good}} match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E

25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and take her to a hospital ("Fantine's Arrest").|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, a hunter notices the bad rabbit sitting on the bench and mistakes him for a bird. [...] He fires at the bad rabbit, but finds nothing but a carrot and a rabbit tail on the bench.

500|$|When Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) {{is asked}} to look after Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) prize-winning Hungarian Puli, he decides to pass the task on to his {{employee}} Drew (Drew Carey). Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly {{to pick up her}} boyfriend Oswald (Diedrich Bader). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one has that kind of money, Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement.|$|E
60|$|His {{cheeks were}} hot. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> as an {{exposure}} of {{another of his}} deficiencies.|$|R

500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E
500|$|He next {{starred in}} Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and {{produced}} by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, [...] "You tell him, 'Okay, you're {{going to play}} a pot dealer', and he comes back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> very seriously, even when it's comedy". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: [...] "He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.|$|E
500|$|In January, Dennis catches Den and {{his girlfriend}} Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed {{together}} and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E
