5|$|While {{entering}} Puerto San Bartolomé in Baja California {{in early}} 1915, Asama struck an uncharted rock and was badly damaged. It took months to refloat <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> make her partially seaworthy. The ship was given temporary repairs at the British naval base at Esquimalt, British Columbia before arriving back in Japan in December where permanent repairs were not completed until March 1917. Asama {{was assigned to}} the Training Squadron later that year and made another cadet training cruise in 1918.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena {{would be used to}} spy on <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> tell her {{that they should be}} friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E

With Magdalena's pregnancy progressing, Carlos offers to financially support <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> act as a surrogate father for the child once it is born. When James discovers his partner's affair with Carlos he feels betrayed and Tomas soon receives a letter notifying him that his landlords are evicting him. Tomas, Magdalena and Carlos struggle to find an affordable place to live due to the gentrification of the area and the rising real estate prices, but Tomas dies in his sleep shortly before they are due to be evicted. In the aftermath, Magdalena is reunited {{with her mother and}} together they visit a gynecologist, who confirms that Magdalena conceived without having penetrative sex. Magdalena's father apologizes to her at Tomas's funeral, believing her conception to be a miracle, and she forgives him.|$|E

They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.|$|E
5|$|Sei Shōnagon, {{author of}} The Pillow Book, {{had been in}} service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is {{possible}} that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi's court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon's The Pillow Book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi's court in a similar manner.|$|E

Both {{she and her}} husband were considerably bothered, as she had been socially very active, although many in society were still prepared to receive <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> press her case sympathetically. Eventually, when Millais was dying, the Queen relented through the intervention of her daughter Princess Louise, allowing Gray to attend an official function. Sixteen months after Millais' death, Effie died at Bowerswell on 23 December 1897 and was buried in Kinnoull churchyard, Perth, which is depicted in Millais's painting The Vale of Rest.|$|E

The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of offerings to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the queen. On the back wall, which lies to the west along the axis of the temple, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, seems to be coming out of the mountain: the goddess is depicted as the Mistress of the temple dedicated to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> queen Nefertari, who is intimately linked to the goddess.|$|E
25|$|At Kytmanovo in Russia between Mongolia and Kazakhstan, dated 1746–1626 BC, {{a strain}} of Yersinia pestis was {{extracted}} from a dead woman's tooth in a grave common to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> two children. This strain's genes express flagellin, which triggers the human immune response. However, by contrast with other prehistoric Yersinia pestis bacteria, the strain does so weakly; later, historic plague does not express flagellin at all, accounting for its virulence. The Kytmanovo strain was therefore under selection toward becoming a plague (although {{it was not the}} plague). The three people in that grave all died at the same time, and the researcher believes that this para-plague is what killed them.|$|E

25|$|When the United States became {{involved}} in World War II, many families of Japanese descent were moved from San Diego and other West Coast cities to internment camps in Arizona and other inland locations. Many of these Japanese-American children were patrons of the library. Breed noticed that before the children {{were sent to the}} camps, their behavior and manners had changed; the formerly outgoing and enthusiastic learners had become sullen and withdrawn. When the day came for the children's departure, many of them came to the library to return their library cards and to say goodbye to Breed. She gave the children self-addressed stamped postcards and told them to write to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> tell her what they needed. When the children wrote, she responded and sent them not only reading materials but personal items such as soap and toothbrushes as well. Many of her former library patrons were sent to the Poston War Relocation Center internment camp in Arizona, where she visited them multiple times.|$|E

As he waits for the pill to take effect he wanders through the hotel and meets an anonymous man who, in fact, is famous playwright Clare Quilty, a friend of the now-deceased Charlotte. Quilty talks to him ambiguously about Dolores. Humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room. There, he finds that the sedative was too mild after seeing Dolores drifting in and out of sleep. He dares not touch her that night, but in the morning Humbert is surprised when she initiates sex with him. While driving the next day, Humbert finally reveals to Dolores that her mother is dead after Dolores insists on calling her from a pay phone.|$|E
