Exploratory factor analyses with one split-half subsample revealed that BAS- 2 scores had a one-dimensional factor structure in women and men. Confirmatory factor analysis with a second split-half subsample showed the one-dimensional factor structure had acceptable fit and was invariant across sex. There were no significant sex differences in BAS- 2 scores. BAS- 2 scores were significantly and positively correlated with appearance <b>evaluation,</b> <b>body</b> areas satisfaction, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Body appreciation was significantly and negatively correlated with BMI in men, but associations in women were only significant in the second subsample.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Women with a {{negative}} <b>body</b> <b>evaluation</b> display covariation bias: They overestimate the relation between their own body and negative social feedback. This study aimed to develop a more fine-grained understanding of this covariation bias and {{to determine whether it}} could be diminished. METHODS: Seventy women completed a computer task wherein three categories of stimuli - pictures of their own body, a control woman's body, and a neutral object - were followed by (nonverbal) negative social feedback or nothing. Participants' estimates of the relation between each stimulus category and negative social feedback were assessed throughout the task. RESULTS: Before starting the task, women with a more negative state <b>body</b> <b>evaluation</b> expected their <b>body</b> to be followed by more negative social feedback (demonstrating a priori covariation bias). During the task, when the relation between stimulus category and negative social feedback was random, women with a more negative trait and state <b>body</b> <b>evaluation</b> perceived at the present moment (online covariation bias) and retrospectively (a posteriori covariation bias) that their body was followed by more negative social feedback. When contingencies were manipulated so that women's own body was rarely followed by negative social feedback, covariation bias was temporarily diminished; this coincided with improvements in state <b>body</b> <b>evaluation.</b> LIMITATIONS: The task did not incorporate neutral or positive social feedback and focused only on undergraduate women. CONCLUSIONS: Covariation bias exists preexperimentally and occurs when situational information is ambiguous. It is possible to (temporarily) diminish covariation bias.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the expression of}} hepatic L-FABP and intestinal I-FABP in an experimental model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonatal rats. METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Control (C 1) - exclusive breastfeeding at the first and sixth procedures (C 6), NEC 1 - fed formula milk and submitted to hypoxia and hypothermia at the first and sixth procedures (NEC 6). The newborn pups were fed twice a day for three days, {{for a total of}} six procedures. Samples were collected for morphometric <b>evaluation</b> (<b>body</b> weight, liver weight, liver weight/body weight ratio, intestinal weight and intestinal/body weight ratio) and for immunohistochemical and Western blotting analysis. The values obtained were analyzed statistically, with the level of significance set at p< 0. 05. RESULTS:Morphometric measurements showed reduction of body and liver weights in the NEC group (p< 0. 05). Both immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed that L-FABP expression in the liver was decreased and I-FABP expression in the ileum was increased in the NEC group (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: L-FABP and I-FABP expression changed inversely in the rat NEC model. These findings can contribute to a better diagnosis of NEC in human newborns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose. The {{trend in}} {{physical}} fitness assessment {{during the past}} 35 years instead of stress motor performance and athletic fitness evaluation (i. e. speed, agility, power, and balance) focuses on assessment of functional capacities related to overall good health and disease prevention. Thus, a term of health-related physical fitness became topical with four its components: aerobic and/or cardiovascular fitness, body composition, abdominal muscle strength and endurance, and lower back and hamstring flexibility. This study was undertaken to evaluate physical activity relation to health-related physical fitness in students. Methods. All participants filled in physical activity questionnaire about duration of their daily activities of slow walking, fast walking, sport exercises at university and additional sport exercises. Health-related physical testing included several core components: 1) body composition <b>evaluation</b> (<b>body</b> weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat, muscle mass), 2) abdominal muscles and hamstring muscles manual tests, 3) dynamometry, 4) hamstring muscles and m. quadratus lumborum elasticity evaluation tests, 5) Romberg balance test, 6) bicycle ergometer test. Results. There were significant differences between physical activity level of Physical Education students and Physiotherapy students, and between men and women. Physical activity positively correlates with waist-to hip-ratio, muscle mass, grip strength and cardiorespiratory fitness parameters, and negatively with body fat. Conclusions.

40|$|The dot-probe task (DPT) is a {{reaction}} time measure of attentional bias. Research using this task has found inconsistent patterns of appearance-related attentional biases in women. This {{study examined the}} effects of a novel priming variation of the DPT, which incorporated additional cues into each trial of the task, on measurement of such biases. The study also examined associations between these biases and body image, a component of eating disorder symptomatology. A convenience sample of women from the general community (N[*]=[*] 103) completed body image measures online and attended a laboratory session to complete one of four DPTs: (1) an appearance-cued DPT containing images of thin-ideal models between each trial; (2) neutral-cued DPT containing images of forests; (3) time-delayed DPT controlling for time in place of an image; or (4) typical DPT containing only word stimuli. Women who completed the appearance-cued DPT demonstrated a stronger attentional bias for positive, but not negative, appearance words than women who completed the other DPT versions. Furthermore, for the appearance-cued and time-delayed DPTs, this bias correlated with poorer body image across several indicators (appearance <b>evaluation,</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, self-evaluative salience of appearance, and state body satisfaction). Although it was unexpected that no attentional bias for negative-appearance words was found, the attentional bias for positive-appearance words may suggest that effects were driven by the ego-threat of positive-appearance words. Further research is warranted to determine whether such biases contribute to and maintain body image disturbance and disordered eating...|$|E
40|$|M. A. The {{search for}} {{identity}} {{is an important}} developmental task during adolescence. During this period teenagers also evaluate their physical identity against existing external standards. <b>Evaluation</b> of the <b>body</b> is often done {{in comparison with the}} Western norms of beauty. These norms are however not universally attainable and can lead to negative <b>evaluations</b> of the <b>body’s</b> attractiveness, resulting in both negative <b>evaluations</b> of the <b>body</b> and body dissatisfaction, which creates concern due to the link that exists between body dissatisfaction and dieting. Diet behaviour has also been established as an etiological factor in the development of certain eating disorders. On the other hand positive <b>evaluations</b> of the <b>body’s</b> appearance and abilities are associated with higher levels of life-satisfaction. It is therefore necessary to develop interventions that could enhance female adolescents’ <b>body</b> <b>evaluations,</b> body-esteem and possibly also life-satisfaction albeit indirectly. Interventions that focused on more realistic evaluations of the self and attempted to enhance teenage girls’ self-esteem have already been implemented in the USA and Australia, but with mixed results. Existing research within the South African context that focus on female adolescents’ <b>body</b> <b>evaluations,</b> body-esteem and life-satisfaction are also limited and no studies could be found that investigated all three facets. The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a psychosocial training programme (PTP), to enhance female adolescents’ <b>body</b> <b>evaluations,</b> body-esteem and life-satisfaction. A group of adolesscent girls (experimental group) (n = 39) participated in the PTP, while the control group (n = 33) looked at magazine photos and then answered questions about these photos. Both groups completed the following measurement scales before and after the completion of the PTP: <b>Body</b> <b>evaluations</b> (Body-Image Self-evaluation Colouring Lens, BISCL) (Gusella, Clark & van Roosmalen, 2003), body-esteem (Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults, BES) vi (Mendelson, White & Mendelson, 1996) and life-sattisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale,SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larson & Griffen, 1985). Firstly the experimental group’s mean averages on all measuring instruments were calculated before and after the completion of the PTP then compared to get an indication of the significance of differences in mean scores within the group. The programme resulted in statistically meaningful changes on al three the measured fascets. After the PTP the <b>body</b> <b>evaluations</b> of participants in the experimental group were less negative towards the form and function of their bodies (BISCL-v (p=. 00) and BISCL-f (p=. 00). The change in mean scores on the BES full scale (p=. 003) and the subscales appearance (p=. 01), attribution (p=. 03) and weight (p=. 00) indicated that evaluation of body- esteem was also more positive. Participants’ life-satisfaction was significantly higher after they participated in the PTP (p=. 03). Effects sizes for the significance of difference in mean scores were also calculated, yielding a large effect on effect <b>body</b> <b>evaluation</b> (0. 19 tot 0. 20), a medium to large effect on body-esteem (0. 12 tot 0. 20) and medium effect on life satisfaction (0. 11). These effect sizes suggest that the results also have practical significance. Secondly the mean scores of the experimental and control groups prior to and after the PTP were compared. No statistically meaningful difference was noted between the mean values of these two groups in terms of <b>body</b> <b>evaluations,</b> body-esteem or life- satisfaction. This is possibly due to the small sample size and variables such as age and ethnicity. In conclusion the psychosocial training programme shows promise as an intervention to enhance female adolescents’ <b>body</b> <b>evaluations,</b> body-esteem and life-satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In view of {{the aging}} society, {{intelligent}} devices pervading everyday life are faced with important challenges, such as the ease of use and the ease of configuration. The whole potential of using a body area network with several sensors to monitor vital functions of a human body can only be tapped, if the sensors used are highly specialized and tightly integrated to collaborate in a decentralized way and exhibit true plug-and-play behavior. Although the aspect of interconnecting vital sensors close to the human body bears a variety of technical challenges in itself, {{the development of the}} necessary abstraction layer in software to hide the heterogeneity of the highly specialized sensor boards is confronted with even higher challenges as these devices are often equipped with very limited resources to reduce power consumption. However, this abstraction layer is a necessary prerequisite to facilitate the development of software for a body area network with the previously mentioned characteristics. This paper presents the results of a study conducted to evaluate the performance and overhead of using web services on embedded devices to implement an abstraction layer for a body area network. In several experiments, two different implementations of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) were evaluated: the Microsoft. NET Micro Framework and the open-source DPWS-plugin from the Web Services for Devices initiative. These were used to measure absolute latencies and the “web service overhead ” in the communication between three different types of resource-constraint devices.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the prophylactic effect of ursodeoxycholic acid and ezetimibe for prevention of gallstone formation after sleeve gastrectomy and to identify some risk factors. Settings and design This was a prospective randomized study conducted at Al Rashid Hospital, Kuwait. Patients and methods A total of 215 obese patients were included. Preoperative assessment was performed, including history, examination, obesity <b>evaluation</b> (<b>body</b> weight, BMI, waist circumference), full laboratory work, gastroscopy, and abdominal ultrasonography. After laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, patients were divided randomly into: group 1 (control), group 2 (ursodeoxycholic acid), and group 3 (ezetimibe). Patients were scheduled for 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -month visits for assessment of % excess weight loss and abdominal ultrasonography. Results A significant reduction in gallstone formation was found in the ezetimibe group (5. 5 %) compared with the control group (17. 6 %). A statistically significant increase in % excess weight loss was observed in patients with gallstones (38. 5 %) versus patients without gallstones (28. 2 %). Percentage of gallstone formation during first 6 months postoperatively was double that during the next 6 months in both the control and treatment groups. Conclusion Risk of gallstone formation during the first 6 months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was double that during the second 6 months.

Rats in group A (n= 10), B (n= 10) and C (n= 10) were fed a standard laboratory chow and allowed tap water ad libitum. In group B and C, renal failure was induced by the administration of a diet containing 0. 75 % adenine for 28 days which began at day 0. Rats in group C were given Chinese herbs (40 ml/kg with drug concentration 1. 75 g/ml) beginning at day 0. Urine albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were determined at days 0, 14 and 28. At day 28, the animals were killed and their kidneys removed for light microscope <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Body</b> weight in Group B decreased more significantly than that in Group C (p= 0. 032) at day 28. The rats in group B demonstrated more severe proteinuria and higher Serum creatinine and BUN levels than group C at day 14 and day 28 (P< 0. 05, 0. 01). All rats given adenine developed marked structural renal damage involving the tubule and interstitium. The values were much less severe in group C than those in group B. In adenine-induced chronic renal failure rats, the protective effects of these Chinese herbs were of a significant nature. Our results do support the notion that these Chinese herbs are useful in deferring the advance of chronic renal failure.

40|$|Background: Massive {{weight loss}} (MWL) {{following}} bariatric surgery frequently {{results in an}} excess of overstretched skin causing physical discomfort and negatively affecting quality of life, self-esteem, body image and physical functioning. Methods: In this cross-sectional study 3 groups were compared: 1) patients prior to bariatric surgery (n= 79), 2) patients after bariatric surgery who had not undergone BCS (n= 252), and 3) patients after bariatric surgery who underwent subsequent body contouring surgery (BCS) (n= 62). All participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing body image (MBSRQ), quality of life (IWQOL-Lite), symptoms of depression (PHQ- 9) and anxiety (GAD- 7). Results: Overall, 62 patients (19. 2 %) reported having undergone a total of 90 BCS procedures. The most common were abdominoplasties (88. 7 %), thigh lifts (24. 2 %), and breast lifts (16. 1 %). Post-bariatric surgery patients differed significantly in most variables from pre-bariatric surgery patients; however, there were fewer differences between patients with and without BCS.

One major problem is that the digital technology has to be acquired from international donors in advanced countries and the Government's public procurement policy stipulates that this transfer of technology from the donor to the recipient must be expedited by a local ‘intermediary agent’ (e. g. business entrepreneurs). Our research findings have confirmed that the local film industry (recipient) requires support with installation of technology, film distribution/ exhibition, and maintenance (production level) and some management tasks. All of which is not usually provided because of incompetency {{on the part of the}} intermediary agents and because of limitations in the public procurement policy for this industry sector. One policy implication is whether government procurement policy should target more direct B 2 B contact between the technology recipient and the international donor. This could help upgrade innovation capabilities of local industry. Our empirical research findings are based on direct insights gained from six semi-structured face-to-face interviews with key respondents based in Bangladesh (e. g. Directors and Senior Management staff of the Bangladesh Film & Development Corporation and other key respondents). Note: findings reported here are from a larger study of 40 + interviews on the theme of digital technology integration in Bangladesh film industry. We report that policy makers should direct policy toward the development of technological system, infrastructure and technical training in the long run, rather than mainly focusing on boosting foreign technical assistance, which does not appear to help support manufacturing processes in film making to make a smooth transition from analogue to digital technology use. There should also be a sterner public <b>evaluation</b> <b>body</b> that pre-evaluates and post-evaluates the success or otherwise of the technology integration process...|$|E
40|$|The Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} for measuring BMD and bone mineral content (BMC). In general, DXA is ideal for pediatric use. However, the development of specific standards for particular geographic regions limits its use and application for certain socio-cultural contexts. Additionally, the anthropometry may be a low cost and easy to use alternative method in epidemiological contexts. The goal of our study was to develop regression equations for predicting bone health of children and adolescents based on anthropometric indicators to propose reference values based on age and sex. 3020 students (1567 males and 1453 females) ranging in ages 4. 0 to 18. 9 were studied from the Maule Region (Chile). Anthropometric variables evaluated included: weight, standing height, sitting height, forearm length, and femur diameter. A total body scan (without the head) was conducted by means of the Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Bone mineral density (BMD) and the bone mineral content (BMC) were also determined. Calcium consumption was controlled for by recording the intake of the three last days prior to the <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Body</b> Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, and somatic maturation was determined by using the years of peak growth rate (APHV). Four regression models were generated to calculate bone health: for males BMD = (R 2 = 0. 79) and BMC = (R 2 = 0. 84) and for the females BMD = (R 2 = 0. 76) and BMC = (R 2 = 0. 83). Percentiles were developed by using the LMS method (p 3, p 5, p 15, p 25, p 50, p 75, p 85, p 95 and p 97). Regression equations and reference curves were developed to assess the bone health of Chilean children and adolescents. These instruments help identify children with potential underlying problems in bone mineralization during the growth stage and biological maturation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{practice}} {{of physical activity}} and a balanced diet {{have been identified as}} strategies to acquire cardiovascular benefits. This study attends to determinate the changes in hormones, testosterone (T) and estrogen (E 2) levels, as a result of regular practice, vigorous physical activity and its influence on body composition and lipid profiles in male athletes, since this gender has a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Methods In this study where recruited 42 male participants 20 of them professional soccer players (SG) (age 15 - 28 years) and as control group 22 students (CG) with sedentary lifestyle (aged 18 - 28 years). The SG workout two times a day, 4 times a week (duration between 60 and 90 minutes each), and competing in football match`s at the weekend. The SG is also subject to a medical diet control. Anthropometric <b>evaluation</b> <b>body</b> composition and clinical analysis where used to determinate the lipid profile and the hormone levels. IPAQ in CG Results There were significant differences between groups (SG minor than CG) mainly in abdominal, subscapular and thigh skinfolds; hips and waist circumference; in the lipid profile the total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL- C levels. On the levels of T and E 2 CG values were minor than SG one’s. We noticed a strong correlation between physical activity level and the T concentration and significant increase among the E 2 levels with exercise. There`s a strong correlation between the increase of T levels and the reduction of subscapular, abdominal skinfolds and waist circumference. Discussion The {{results of the present study}} suggest that vigorous physical activity have improved the body composition, particularly in the reduction of central fat mass, in the SG and there lipid profile by increasing the T levels. The findings support that individuals who practice vigorous physical activity in a relation of "dose-effect" acquire additional benefits which reduces the risk of mortality (Teramoto et al 2009; Tompson et al 2007) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} the rapidly changing research evaluation and funding landscape in Australian universities, specifically {{in relation to}} open access and institutional repositories. Recent announcements indicate that funding and <b>evaluation</b> <b>bodies</b> are becoming increasingly concerned that publicly funded research be made publicly available. The paper then reports a survey of all levels of academic staff plus research students at one Australian university conducted in May 2006, prior {{to the introduction of}} an institutional repository. The survey, in line with previously reported surveys, found that while there was a high level of engagement with scholarly publishing, there was a low level of awareness of, or concern with, either open access ("green" or "gold") or the roles repositories can play in increasing accessibility of research. Practically, this indicates that much work needs to be done within this university to increase knowledge of, and change behaviours with regard to, open access and repositories if the university and its academics are {{to make the most of}} new funding requirements and research evaluation processes...|$|R
