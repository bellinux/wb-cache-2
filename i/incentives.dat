In an international mixed oligopoly, we analyse the interaction between privatisation and FDI. We show that privatisation increases the <b>incentive</b> for FDI, which in turn, increases the <b>incentive</b> for privatisation compared to the situation of no FDI. The optimal degree of privatisation depends on the cost difference between the public and the foreign firms, and on the foreign firm's mode of entry. We show that our results are robust with respect to the <b>incentive</b> contracts between the owners and the managers. The <b>incentive</b> for FDI and is higher under the <b>incentive</b> contract than under the no <b>incentive</b> contract, and the optimal degree of privatisation is almost always higher under the <b>incentive</b> contract than under the no <b>incentive</b> contract.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a general analytical framework to analyze and design a large family of <b>incentive</b> protocols. We consider a class of <b>incentive</b> protocols wherein peers can distributively learn and adapt their actions. Using our analytical framework, one can evaluate the expected performance gain and system robustness of a given <b>incentive</b> protocol. To illustrate the framework, we present three <b>incentive</b> policies and two learning (or adaptive) models. We show under what conditions the network may collapse (e. g., no cooperation in the system) or the <b>incentive</b> protocol can guarantee a high degree of cooperation. In particular, we formally show the connection between evaluating <b>incentive</b> protocols and evolutionary game theory so to identify robustness characteristics of an <b>incentive</b> policy.

5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} <b>incentives</b> were {{virtually}} non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures.

The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax <b>incentives.</b> A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E

If the nodes are rational, free packet forwarding by the nodes cannot be taken for granted and <b>incentive</b> based protocols are required to stimulate cooperation among the nodes. Existing <b>incentive</b> based approaches are based on the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism which leads to high levels of <b>incentive</b> budgets and restricted applicability to only certain topologies of networks. Moreover, the existing approaches have only focused on unicast and multicast. Motivated by this, we propose an <b>incentive</b> based broadcast protocol that satisfies Bayesian <b>incentive</b> compatibility and minimizes the <b>incentive</b> budgets required by the individual nodes. The proposed protocol, which we call BIC-B (Bayesian <b>incentive</b> compatible broadcast) protocol, also satisfies budget balance. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the ex-post individual rationality of the BIC-B protocol. The BIC-B protocol exhibits superior performance in comparison to a dominant strategy <b>incentive</b> compatible broadcast protocol.

Likewise, the failure of a recipient to meet public body’s expectations about a project (e.g., employment) can prompt it to impose strict project commitments on new <b>incentive</b> recipients. Conversely, an <b>incentive</b> program with a successful track record of business expansion or retention can encourage the expansion of the program or the adoption of new <b>incentive</b> programs.|$|R

The ability to upregulate cognitive control in motivationally salient situations was examined in individuals with schizophrenia (patients) and healthy controls. Fifty-four patients and 39 healthy controls were recruited. A computerized monetary response conflict task required participants to identity a picture, over which was printed a matching (congruent), neutral, or incongruent word. This baseline condition was followed by an <b>incentive</b> condition, in which participants were given the opportunity to win money on reward-cued trials. These reward-cued trials were interleaved with nonreward cued trials. Reaction times (RT) were examined for both <b>incentive</b> context effects (difference in RT between baseline and nonreward cue trials in the <b>incentive</b> condition) and <b>incentive</b> cue effects (difference in RT between nonreward and reward cue trials in the <b>incentive</b> condition). Compared with baseline, controls showed a speeding of responses during both the nonreward (<b>incentive</b> context effect) and reward cued (<b>incentive</b> cue effect) trials during the <b>incentive</b> condition, but with a larger <b>incentive</b> context than <b>incentive</b> cue effect, suggesting a reliance on proactive control strategies.
