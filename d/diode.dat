5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and <b>diode</b> lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Helium–neon lasers, {{a type of}} low-powered {{gas laser}} {{producing}} a red beam, had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper <b>diode</b> lasers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} <b>diode's</b> current–voltage characteristic can {{be tailored}} by selecting the semiconductor {{materials and the}} doping impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture. These techniques are used to create special-purpose <b>diodes</b> that perform many different functions. [...] For example, <b>diodes</b> are used to regulate voltage (Zener <b>diodes),</b> to protect circuits from high voltage surges (avalanche <b>diodes),</b> to electronically tune radio and TV receivers (varactor <b>diodes),</b> to generate radio-frequency oscillations (tunnel <b>diodes,</b> Gunn <b>diodes,</b> IMPATT <b>diodes),</b> and to produce light (light-emitting <b>diodes).</b> Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT <b>diodes</b> exhibit negative resistance, which is useful in microwave and switching circuits.|$|R

5|$|The {{screen on}} the Executive was a {{monolithic}} seven-segment gallium arsenide light emitting <b>diode</b> display, bought from a Canadian firm. The small screen reduced the power consumption and material costs, {{but it was}} revised several times in pursuit of lower power consumption, creating issues with the reliability.|$|E
5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic infrared devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm <b>diode</b> lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use <b>diode</b> pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser <b>diode</b> at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
5000|$|Voltage {{breakdown}} <b>diodes</b> {{are often}} used as noise generators. [...] There are two breakdown mechanisms: Zener and avalanche. <b>Diodes</b> with the corresponding effects are known as Zener <b>diodes</b> and avalanche <b>diodes.</b> The two mechanisms have different noise behaviors.|$|R
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} lower forward voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon <b>diodes)</b> germanium <b>diodes</b> have an inherent advantage over silicon <b>diodes,</b> especially in circuits like full-wave bridge rectifiers which result in 2X voltage drop because the current must pass through two <b>diodes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{complication}} of scaling down is that <b>diodes</b> used in larger scale rectennas cannot operate at THz frequencies without large loss in power. The large loss in {{power is a}} result of the junction capacitance (also known as parasitic capacitance) found in p-n junction <b>diodes</b> and Schottky <b>diodes,</b> which can only operate effectively at frequencies less than 5 THz. [...] The ideal wavelengths of 0.4-1.6 μm correspond to frequencies of approximately 190-750 THz, which is much larger than the capabilities of typical <b>diodes.</b> Therefore, alternative <b>diodes</b> need to be used for efficient power conversion. In current optical rectenna devices, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling <b>diodes</b> are used. Unlike Schottky <b>diodes,</b> MIM <b>diodes</b> are not affected by parasitic capacitances because they work on the basis of electron tunneling. Because of this, MIM <b>diodes</b> have been shown to operate effectively at frequencies around 150 THz.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, <b>diode</b> lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting <b>diode</b> (LED).|$|E
5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and <b>diode</b> lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Resonant {{interband}} tunneling <b>diodes</b> (RITDs) {{combine the}} structures {{and behaviors of}} both intraband resonant tunneling <b>diodes</b> (RTDs) and conventional interband tunneling <b>diodes,</b> in which electronic transitions occur between the energy levels in the quantum wells in the conduction band {{and that in the}} valence band. Like resonant tunneling <b>diodes,</b> resonant interband tunneling <b>diodes</b> can be realized in both the III-V and Si/SiGe materials systems.|$|R
50|$|Exposing a {{semiconductor}} {{to light}} can generate electron-hole pairs, {{which increases the}} number of free carriers and thereby the conductivity. <b>Diodes</b> optimized {{to take advantage of}} this phenomenon are known as photodiodes.Compound semiconductor <b>diodes</b> can also be used to generate light, as in light-emitting <b>diodes</b> and laser <b>diodes.</b>|$|R

25|$|A laser <b>diode</b> is a laser {{where the}} active medium is a {{semiconductor}} {{similar to that}} found in a light-emitting <b>diode.</b> The most common and practical type of laser <b>diode</b> is formed from a p-n junction and powered by injected electric current.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the LHC magnet protection system, the irradiation hardness of high current by-pass <b>diodes</b> is subject to examination.

50|$|Another variant {{is to use}} <b>diodes</b> or resistors, {{but neither}} <b>diodes</b> (e.g. Metal {{insulator}} metal <b>diodes),</b> nor non-linear voltage dependent resistors (i.e. varistors) are currently used with the latter not yet economical, compared to TFT.|$|R
25|$|A laser <b>diode</b> is {{electrically}} a PIN <b>diode.</b> The {{active region}} of the laser <b>diode</b> is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial <b>diode</b> laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular <b>diode,</b> the goal for a laser <b>diode</b> is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser <b>diode</b> epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

30|$|The {{current of}} InP-based <b>diodes</b> {{is more than}} one order-of-magnitude larger than the current of GaN-based <b>diodes</b> (see Figures 6 and 7), but the ratio of current change due to {{exposure}} to H 2 is about the same for both types of <b>diodes.</b> InP <b>diodes</b> are advantageous for H 2 measurements at room temperature due to their lower cost and larger current needing less laborious electronics. Beyond, more expensive GaN <b>diodes</b> are predicted for H 2 measurements at high temperatures.|$|R
