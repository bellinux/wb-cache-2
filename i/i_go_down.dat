500|$|In interviews, Frobisher {{elicited}} the students' reasoning. One fifth-year {{decided that}} 0 was even {{because it was}} found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned [...] "1 is odd and if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> it's even." [...] The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses. A second-year was [...] "quite convinced" [...] that zero was odd, on the basis that [...] "it is the first number you count". A fourth-year referred to 0 as [...] "none" [...] and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since [...] "it's not a number". In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups.|$|E
500|$|Brown's verse {{begins with}} the lyric [...] "Girl, I wanna fuck you right now," [...] which {{is the antithesis of}} how Rihanna concludes the {{original}} interlude, sing [...] "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now." [...] Brown's verse continues with [...] "Been a long time I've been missing your body/ Turn the lights down/ When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> it's a private party." [...] Brown delivers his vocals in an aggressive and manipulative manner as he sings [...] "Give it to her in the worst way, can't wait to blow her candles out." [...] At the end of the song, Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude; [...] "Remember how you did it/ If you still wanna kiss it/ Then come and get it." [...] According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun, the instrumentation of [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] consists of [...] "snaky, slurpy, bass-droppin' beats." [...] The song's lyrics revolve around sadomasochistic sexuality and dominance over men, and consists mainly of oral sex metaphors, including the lyric [...] "Doggy want the kitty." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I {{have to do something}} else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E
