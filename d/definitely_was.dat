5|$|Thutmose I was {{the first}} king who <b>definitely</b> <b>was</b> buried in the Valley of the Kings. Ineni was {{commissioned}} to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, {{has been identified as}} KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E

He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition.

[...] This view is supported by Henri R. Casgrain, in his Les Sulpiciens et les Pretres des Missions-Etrangeres en Acadie (1676-1762), Pruneau & Kirouac, Quebec 1897. He refers to Cadillac on p 61. of this work as (translated) [...] "...a Gascon adventurer, the most wicked character in the world, a scatter-brain expelled from France for I don't know what reason." [...] (p.61) This judgment is based on reflections about several individuals who contributed to the difficulties of early missionaries in Acadia. It supports the judgment of Zoltvany given above.|$|E

As far as influence, the way that I sing, I <b>definitely</b> <b>was</b> inspired by Mike Patton, but lyrically, I approach my songs very differently than Mike Patton does.

2500|$|In late January 1875, The Times ran {{advertisements}} for the Royalty Theatre: [...] "In preparation, a new comic opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan, in which Madame Dolaro and Nelly Bromley will appear." [...] Reginald Allen and other writers took {{this as an}} advertisement for Trial by Jury. [...] However, as George McElroy noted, the advertisement does not mention a librettist, a peculiar omission if {{it was to have}} been W. S. Gilbert, since Gilbert was, at that point, better known to London theatregoers than Sullivan. [...] Moreover, Trial has no place for two principal ladies, but The Zoo does. [...] McElroy demonstrated that the January advertisement <b>definitely</b> <b>was</b> not for Trial, when he discovered a further advertisement in The Era of 14 March 1875, which noted that [...] "In consequence of the continued success of La Périchole, the production of Mr. Sullivan's two-act opera is postponed." [...] That two-act work must have been something entirely different from Trial by Jury, which is in one act, and which opened just eleven days later.|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647–80) was {{notorious for}} obscene verses, {{many of which}} were {{published}} posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other Restoration rakes such as Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and George Etherege. Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries after. One poem which <b>definitely</b> <b>was</b> by him was [...] "A Ramble in St. James's Park" [...] in which the protagonist's quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead [...] "Bugg'ries, Rapes and Incest" [...] on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when [...] "Ancient Pict began to Whore". This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester's poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with a general change in attitudes to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film The Libertine about his life based on an existing play.|$|E
