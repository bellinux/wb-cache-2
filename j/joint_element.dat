Interrupts are formed on a circumference of the <b>joint</b> <b>element.</b> A wall thickness of the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> constantly decreases along a section in a direction of the tension ring. The <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> tapers partially both in an inner diameter and an outer diameter in a direction of the tension ring. The Clamping element is made of chrome steel. USE - Clamping element for shrink tensioning of bodies of a drilling tool. ADVANTAGE - The element allows reliable clamping of bodies of larger circumference. The circular <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> is arranged between the base body and the closed tension ring and is fixed to both the base and the tensioning ring, thus flexibly receiving differences in a radial thermal expansion produced between the base body and the closed tension ring, so as to limit the heating of the tension ring. The circular geometry of the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> increases stability of clamping in radial direction, thus preventing undesired lateral slipping during loading by process forces.

40|$|This study aims to {{simulate}} spontaneous rupture propagation of the discontinuous plane which is modeled by {{the arrangement of}} three dimensional joint elements. To achieve this purpose, we first modified the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> proposed by Toki et al. as follows. First, we removed the assumption that four nodal points forming a joint plane were still on one plane even after its deformation. Second, the stress drop {{was introduced in the}} shear component of the constitutive relationships of the element. Third, we made it possible to model the discontinuous plane which had arbitrary normal direction by introducing a general three dimensional coordinate transform matrix. Two models were used in this study to verify the applicability of the modified element to express spontaneous rupture propagation. One was used to examine the rupture propagation which propagated one-dimensionally, the other two-dimensionally. It was found that the modified <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> was able to express the rupture propagation phenomenon just same as the two dimensional <b>joint</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{triangle}} element; crack propagation; joint element; numerical simulation. Abstract. In {{order to}} model the mechanical behavior of joints efficiently, a thin-layer tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> is constructed. The stiffness matrix of the element is derived in the paper. For it shares the common nodes with the original tri-node triangle element, the tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> can be applied {{to model the}} crack propagation without remeshing or mesh adjustment. Another advantage is that the cracked body is meshed without consideration of its geometry integrity and existence of the joints or pre-existed crack in the procedure of mesh generation, and then the triangular element intersected by the crack or joint is automatically transformed into the tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> to represent pre-existed cracks. These make the numerical simulation of crack propagation highly convenient and efficient. After CZM is chosen to model the crack tip, the mixed- energy simple criterion is used to determine whether the element is intersected by the extended crack or not, the extended crack is located in the model. By modeling the marble plates with two edge cracks subjected to the uniaxial compressive loads, it is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results, which suggests that the present method is valid and feasible in modeling rock crack propagation...|$|E

40|$|As a FEM for {{reinforced}} concrete bond-slip problems, one {{important feature of}} the typical double spring <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> method is {{the selection of the}} normal stiffness, which may cause the mutual embedding problem and bring challenges to the calculation. In this paper, a novel single spring <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> method based on the mixed coordinate system is proposed to simulate the interaction of two materials. Instead of choosing the normal stiffness arbitrarily, the proposed method makes DOFs of two materials in the normal direction equal to ensure deformation compatibility. And its solid elements for the concrete are solved in global coordinate system, while the beam elements for the steel bar are solved in local coordinate system. In addition, the proposed method can also be applied to RC structures with irregular arrangements of steel bars. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the bond model is applied to RC beams with the description of the damage process...|$|E

The element is a hybrid method and incorporates features of classical analytical and numerical methods. The element stiffness and load vector formulations have unique, load dependent, non-linear shape functions based on an analytical solution.

The program considers the case without pore water pressure dissipation and that with coupled consolidation (Biot theory).

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} studies on joints. A formulation for the coupled analysis of thermo- hydro- mechanical problems in joints is presented. The work involves {{the establishment of}} equilibrium and mass and energy balance equations. Balance equations were formulated taking into account two phases: water and air. Once the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> was implemented in Code_Bright computer code, it was then used to study some cases. The numerical simulation of hydraulic shear tests of roughness granite joints is presented. This allowed evaluating the coupling between permeability and the geometry of {{the opening of the}} joint. Then, a thermo-hydro-mechanical simulation of a large-scale nuclear waste repository was performed considering the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> to model the interface between canister and bentonite. This example allowed evaluating the behaviour of the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> when coupled to continuum elements. Then, other examples show how hydro-mechanical coupling affects the permeability and saturation of the joints and adjacent material. Finally, the gas flow through joints was also investigated. The experimental investigation focused on the effects of suction on the mechanical behaviour of rock joints. Laboratory tests were performed in a direct shear cell equipped with suction control. Suction was monitored using a vapour forced convection circuit controlled by an air pump that was connected to the shear cell. Once equilibrium conditions are achieved, the rock specimen is assumed to reach the Relative Humidity imposed by the flowing air at a given vapour concentration. Artificial joints of Lilla claystone were prepared. Joint roughness of varying intensity was created by carving the surfaces in contact in such a manner that rock ridges of different tip angles formed. These angles ranged from 0 º (smooth joint) to 45 º (very rough joint profile). The geometric profiles of the two surfaces in contact were initially positioned in a "matching" situation. Several tests were performed for different values of suction (200, 100 and 20 MPa) and for different values of vertical stress (30, 60 and 150 kPa). A constitutive model including the effects of suction and joint roughness is proposed to simulate the unsaturated behaviour of rock joints. The new constitutive law was incorporated in the code and experimental data were numerically simulated. Postprint (published version...|$|E
