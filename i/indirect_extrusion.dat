All the simulations were performed with the implicit finite element code Forge 2009 ® with user input written in Visual Fortran®.

The Forge 2009 ® 2 D module was used to investigate both direct and <b>indirect</b> axisymmetric rod <b>extrusions.</b> The extrusion load and the temperature rise were predicted and the load-displacement curves and the events {{that took place in}} both extrusion modes were also simulated, discussed and again verified. The effects of {{the difference between the two}} modes, especially friction and its consequences on the process were investigated. The indirect results point to a good method of improving efficiency. For complex solid section, the 3 D module has been used to study the load required, temperature evolution, surface formation of the extrudate and material flow during the process. These all showed good correlation with experimental results. The microstructure evolution during the extrusion process and the following solution soaking process were simulated with physically-based mathematical microstructure models integrated into FEM through its Fortran® subroutine interface,. The agreement between the predicted microstructures using associated models and experimental measurements were acceptable.

Backward {{extrusion}} (it is {{also called}} <b>indirect</b> <b>extrusion)</b> is an extrusion {{process in which}} the billet is placed in the container cavity, and where the movement of the punch is in the opposite direction to the movement of the flow of the metal.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} first {{results of}} <b>indirect</b> <b>extrusion</b> of Al/Mg compounds. In earlier tests of lateral extrusion and hydrostatic extrusion first basic {{insights into the}} compound generation were gained. The current investigation focuses on another application of the compound manufacturing approach using industrial equipment and the verification of basic results. The calculation of the material flow, the design of appropriate extrusion dies, the design and preparation of the compound billets and the selection of processing parameters are major tasks. By completely encasing the Mg core with Al material including the rod faces the pre-advancement of the core material was prevented. Two different extrusion ratios were selected in order to detect the influence of deformation on the bond generation. The billet geometry, the volume ratio between Al and Mg, the billet treatment and the processing parameters remained constant throughout the test series for better comparability of results. The process and die design were aided by FEM simulation. The main goal in calculation was a nearly equal material flow of both the Al and Mg partners. The generation of a metal bond was achieved.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for efficiency and energy savings can be satisfied by innovative lightweight construction, {{especially in the}} automotive and mechanical engineering sectors. One approach lies in the use and development of magnesium alloys for industrial applications, something which is made more difficult due to magnesium's high affinity for oxygen and its subsequent low corrosion resistance. In order to ensure corrosion protection appropriate to the requirements, thicker coatings which cannot be created using conventional coating processes need to be produced and the current preference is to fabricate these from aluminium. An additional aim {{is to create a}} protective layer to resist mechanical effects. This, based on its dimensioning and consequent higher percentage of mass, is required to contribute towards absorbing the bending and torsion load in the material bond. In addition, a substance to substance bond needs to be created between the cover and the core material. A bond with the required strength can only be expected if the transportation of material across the interface is made possible between the partners for bonding. Under specific technological conditions, it has proved possible to provide evidence of the formation of a distinctive diffusion zone between a wrought magnesium alloy AZ 31 and a standard aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060 [1]. Together with the chemical and contact conditions, the following restrictions, among others, are also important when it comes to triggering a solid body reaction of this nature, namely, almost "ideal" contact between the reactants, a high level of disorder in the lattice structure as well as the supply of a certain amount of energy (the so-called threshold energy) [2]. Consequently, a fundamental principle {{for the creation of a}} bond using metal forming is the targeted interaction of technological parameters which make the maximum increase in the interface surface possible under high standard compressive stresses. Another important aspect is the forming temperature which not only has a decisive influence on the flow behaviour of the partners for bonding but also supplies the necessary amount of energy to activate transport of the material. Under these conditions it was also possible to identify appropriate basic evidence of very rapid diffusion processes during forming, including the forming processes of extrusion moulding and lateral extrusion [3; 4]. The current results as far as <b>indirect</b> <b>extrusion</b> moulding is concerned show that a peripheral bond forms in the interface but that this is weakened by cracks. By applying hydrostatic extrusion moulding it proved possible to prevent inhomogeneities of this nature; however, it may be assumed that, as far as fault-free bonding is concerned, the process window is highly susceptible to error. For this reason provision has been made for tests with intermediate zinc layers for <b>indirect</b> <b>extrusion</b> moulding to enable their influence to be assessed under conditions that are less than ideal when it comes to achieving a perfect bond. Of major interest is the development of phases using an intermediate zinc layer in the interface, as well as their characteristics in the bonding system described...|$|E

Preliminary tests {{have shown that the}} developed apparatus will be suitable for following the viscosity changes during the setting of dental materials. It is important to know the viscosity, and, hence, the flow properties of dental mate-rials in the fluid stage. This relates to their ability to adapt to a required shape. When setting materials, viscosity alters with time; knowledge of these changes can yield infor-mation about working and setting times. In addition, it is desirable to know how vis-cosity varies with shear rate in order to cor-relate optimal shear properties with the method of application.

Backward extrusion is a popular industrial technique for the manufacture of tube and cans. This report serves to examine the forming loads, metal flow and extrusion defects arising during the backward extrusion of aluminium cups. The report surveys the literature of extrusion with particular interest in backward extrusion. Extrusion was carried out {{with the aid of a}} specially constructed 50 mm backward extrusion tool designed and manufactured by the author. Five extrusion ratios were examined, using both the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>extrusion</b> directions and flat, conical and nosed punch ends were used to examine metal flow and forming loads for various punch profiles. Forming loads were found to be much greater for direct extrusion and the usual relationship was derived for load/extrusion ratio characteristics. The effects of friction and lubrication were examined and these effects on load and flow patterns were noted. Incremental forming of split billets with grids scribed on the mid-plane was carried out for a variety of punch profiles. This revealed the evidence of a dead metal region forming and arc below the end of flat punches. The geometry of dead metal regions was compared with that derived by an upper bound technique and found to agree well. Also, upper bound loads using this model were derived and found to compare favourably. Forming using conical punch profiles showed that the adoption of a smooth profile similar in geometry to the dead metal zone reduced extrusion leads significantly. Extrusion defects were examined and found to fall into three categories, namely cavitation, internal cracking and shearing of the corner. Cavitation was found to occur when the base thickness becomes smaller than the wall thickness, which was also proved theoretically. Also cracking was found to occur only at large extrusion ratios during direct extrusion. Finally, in the light of conclusions drawn from the work, recommendations were made as to suggestions for further work which could usefully continue the present work...|$|E

Microforming devices including ECAP, IE and DD dies in plane strain condition were designed and fabricated to manifest process outcomes/anomalies in small length-scale deformations {{for a range}} of imposed strains: severe (ECAP), moderate (IE) and low (DD). This was captured by conducting in situ experiments on commercially pure metals: Ni 200, Oxygen Free High Conductivity (OFHC) Cu, Al 1100 and Pb.

To do this, ECAP and IE devices were designed with a transparent viewing window made of Sapphire block enables the imaging of the material flow during deformation using high-speed (CCD) and IR cameras. While DD of metallic sheets was performed in a microforming setup that sits inside the chamber of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) enables in situ characterization of material flow behavior using SEM based DIC. Pre and post–Mortem Microstructure analysis was carried out by performing Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) across the microformed machine elements aiming to correlate spatially evolved microstructures/textures across the deformation zone with the mechanics of deformation obtained by in situ observations for the given materials system. In microforming, variables such as initial microstructure, process configuration and tooling design along with the deformation process parameters are known as crucial factors that determine the deformation behavior of material and therefore the process consequences including failure characteristics and quality of microparts surface finish. In the present dissertation, the effect of process parameters and scaling was studied and the role of characteristics of prior microstructures such as grain size and its distribution, grain morphology, twin size and density, pre-existing textures, etc. and their contribution in improving or disproving the formability was delineated for different deformation geometries and material systems. These studies revealed the strong dependence of the morphology and characteristics of plastic deformation zone (PDZ) to the process outcomes e. g. microstructure evolution, surface roughening, sudden failure, etc. which are the results of the mechanical/microscopical responses of material to the geometric confinements and strain gradients.
