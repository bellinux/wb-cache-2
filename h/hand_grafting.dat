40|$|Grafting, an old plant {{propagation}} practice, is still widely used with fruit trees {{and in recent}} decades also with vegetables. Taxonomic proximity is a general prerequisite for successful graft-take and long-term survival of the grafted, composite plant. However, the mechanisms underlying interspecific graft incompatibility are as yet insufficiently understood. Hormonal signals, auxin in particular, are believed {{to play an important}} role in the wound healing and vascular regeneration within the graft union zone. Long-distance protein, mRNA and small RNA graft-transmissible signals currently emerge as novel mechanisms which regulate nutritional and developmental root/top relations and may play a pivotal role in grafting physiology. Grafting also has significant pathogenic projections. On one hand, stock to scion mechanical contact enables the spread of diseases, even without a complete graft union. But, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>grafting</b> onto resistant rootstocks serves as a principal tool in the management of fruit tree plagues and vegetable soil-borne diseases. The ‘graft hybrid’ historic controversy has not yet been resolved. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of DNA-methylation patterns may account for certain graft-transformation phenomena. Root grafting is a wide spread natural phenomenon; both intraspecific and interspecific root grafts have been recorded. Root grafts have an evolutionary role in the survival of storm-hit forest stands as well as in the spread of devastating diseases. A more fundamental evolutionary role is hinted by recent findings that demonstrate plastid and nuclear genome transfer between distinct Nicotiana species in the graft union zone, within a tissue culture system. This has led to the formation of alloploid cells that, under laboratory conditions, gave rise to a novel, alloploid Nicotiana species, indicating that natural grafts may play a role in plant speciation. under certain circumstances...|$|E

30|$|One of the {{efficient}} methods {{to obtain the}} modifying layer with high content of polymer on the silica surface is a chemical assembly of the grafted layer that is realized by growing the polymer with the specified structure from the monomers and oligomers [11, 12]. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>grafted</b> polymer layer of the desired structure can be formed via an activation of the polysiloxane by a depolymerization of macromolecules with further grafting of obtained oligomers on the silica surface. Depolymerization {{can be carried out}} thermally (300 – 400  °C) [5] or by treatment with active agents such as alkalis, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids [13], thionyl chloride [14], amines [15], or a mixture of alkali (NaOH, KOH) with alcohols (methanol, ethanol) [16], as well as dimethyl or diethylcarbonate [17], which does not introduce contaminants into the system.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the outcome of renal transplantation patients between the dates 5. 5. 1994 and 13. 8. 2000 at Erciyes University Medical Faculty. Material and Method: Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier test and survival rates in groups by Logrank test. Results: A total of 30 patients without any contraindications for transplantation underwent regular hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and had renal transplantation. Nineteen of transplanted kidneys were received from living donors whereas cadaveric kidneys were used in 11 patients. Acute rejection was diagnosed and treated in 3 patients.

40|$|AbstractThe {{topography}} of the somatosensory maps of our body [1] can be largely shaped by alterations of peripheral sensory inputs [2, 3]. Following hand amputation, the hand cortical territory becomes responsive to facial cutaneous stimulation [4 – 7]. Amputation-induced remapping, however, reverses after transplantation, as the <b>grafted</b> <b>hand</b> (re) gains its sensorimotor representation [8]. Here, we investigate hand tactile perception {{in a former}} amputee by touching either <b>grafted</b> <b>hand</b> singly or in combination with another body part. The results showed that tactile sensitivity recovered rapidly, being remarkably good 5 months after transplant. In the right <b>grafted</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the newly acquired somatosensory awareness was strikingly hampered when the ipsilateral face was touched simultaneously, i. e., right face perception extinguished right hand perception. Ipsilateral face-hand extinction was present in the formerly dominant right hand 5 months after transplant and eventually disappeared 6 months afterwards. Control conditions' results showed that right hand tactile awareness was not extinguished either by contralateral left face and left hand stimulation or ipsilateral stimulation of the arm, which is bodily close to, but cortically far from, the hand. We suggest that ipsilateral face-hand extinction is a perceptual counterpart of the remapping that occurs after allograft and eyewitnesses the inherently competitive nature of sensory representations...|$|R

40|$|Background. The International Registry on Hand and Composite Tissue Transplantation {{was founded}} in May 2002, and the {{analysis}} of all cases with follow-up information up to July 2010 is presented here. Methods. From September 1998 to July 2010, 49 hands (17 unilateral and 16 bilateral hand transplantations, including 1 case of bilateral arm transplantation) have been reported, {{for a total of}} 33 patients. They were 31 men and 2 women (median age 32 years). Time since hand loss ranged from 2 months to 34 years, and in 46 % of cases, the level of amputation was at wrist. Immunosuppressive therapy included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and steroids; polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were used for induction. Topical immunosuppression was also used in several cases. Follow-up ranges from 1 month to 11 years. Results. One patient died on day 65. Three patients transplanted in the Western countries have lost their graft, whereas until September 2009, seven <b>hand</b> <b>grafts</b> were removed for noncompliance to the immunosuppressive therapy in China. Eighty-five percent of recipients experienced at least one episode of acute rejection within the first year, and they were reversible when promptly treated. Side effects included opportunistic infections, metabolic complications, and malignancies. All patients developed protective sensibility, 90 % of them developed tactile sensibility, and 82. 3 % also developed a discriminative sensibility. Motor recovery enabled patients to perform most daily activities. Conclusions. Hand transplantation is a complex procedure, and its success is based on patient's compliance and his or her careful evaluation before and after transplantation. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>graft</b> polymers are produced by the insertion of polymer chains into the main chain of other polymer in order to give specific and novel properties. The main purpose on this work was developing PU cores as precursors of new graft polymers which can be easily polymerized by free radicals. In this context, a vinyl monomer (vinyl benzyl-N-methyl-D-glucamine, VbNMDG) was synthesized from N-methyl-D-glucamine and p-chloromethylstyrene. The synthesized monomer was employed for the formation of PU core using 4, 4 ́-methylene-bis-(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI). The monomer synthesis and the double bond incorporation to the PU matrix were verified by NMR 13 C and 1 H. Thereafter, 0. 1 g of different PU cores was mixed with an equal VbNMDG amount, using a dioxane-water mixture as solvent in the presence of radical initiator (ammonium per sulfate, 2 % molar of VbNMDG). The reaction was carried out at 70 °C using nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. The graft polymers obtained were characterized by FT-IR and elemental analysis. The insertion of poly(VbNMDG) chains into the PU cores gives them the boron retention capacity in aqueous solutions. Our results show the possibility to obtained PU cores which can be polymerized via free radicals to the graft of functional polymer chain in a second polymerization...|$|R

Abuhassan and Shannak [20] reported the results of nonvascularized fibular graft for the reconstruction of bone defects after en bloc resection of giant ABC in three patients. They observed insufficient graft incorporation at the distal part of the fibular graft in the humerus case at the 18 th month postoperatively. They treated this patient by open reduction and internal fixation with additional bone grafting. They advised rigid fixation of fibular graft onto the normal bone with a supplemental form of internal fixation to prevent graft insufficiency. In the present case, graft incorporation was observed only in the distal part of the fibular graft at the third-month follow-up. Therefore, immobilization period was decided to prolong for additional 3  months. But the patient and his family could not show compliance with prolonged immobilization.|$|R

40|$|Background: The Superficial Palmar arch (SPA) is an {{anastomosis}} {{between the}} ulnar and radial artery in the palm. Maximum contribution in the arch is by an ulnar artery {{and it is}} completed by superficial palmar branch of radial artery or arteria princeps pollicis or arteria radialis indicis or median artery. The SPA develops as a terminal plexus of axis artery which is later joined by median, ulnar and radial arteries as these arteries develop. Materials & Methods: Present study conducted in the Department of Anatomy, Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute on 50 (28 right and 22 left) formalin fixed hands were used. The variations observed were classified as per Coleman and Anson, 1961, classification of the superficial palmar arch.

40|$|In nine adult baboons, {{full-thickness}} {{skin grafts}} were reciprocally exchanged between three glabrous skin sites {{on one hand}} and glabrous skin sites on the contralateral hand or foot, and a hairy skin site on the dorsum of the ipsilateral <b>hand.</b> The <b>grafts</b> acquired some of the physical characteristics of the recipient site; glabrous skin became thinner and more pliable on the dorsum of the hand and hairy skin became thicker and displayed a more irregular surface contour when transferred to the palm. The electrophysiological properties of cutaneous mechanoreceptors serving these grafts were examined about 5 months after surgery and again after 1 year. Measurements of conduction velocity, receptive field size and shape, and responses to mechanical stimuli suggested that axons serving mechanoreceptors in glabrous grafts functioned at nearly normal levels by 5 months, while axons innervating hairy skin grafts, whether transferred to a glabrous skin site or to a hairy skin site, performed less well even after 1 year. These observations suggest that factors intrinsic to the graft are a major determinant of the quality of sensory function achieved following a skin graft procedure. These factors affect the relative proportions of rapidly and slowly adapting fibres, conduction velocities, thresholds and receptive field configurations. As a result, hairy skin is not the tissue choice for plastic surgical procedures requiring optimum sensory return...|$|R

Donor thymus placed under the renal capsule at a dose of 0 - 5 mg/g of recipient resulted in normal humoral immunity, while a minimum dose of 1 - 5 mg/g was required to reconstitute cellular competence. None of the various amounts of allogeneic thymus tissue transplanted affected the immunological status of nude recipients when grafts were obtained from donors 4 days of age or older. Histological findings correlated with the humoral and cellular responses observed. In nudes grafted with neonatal tissue, the thymus implant proliferated and developed normal architecture.

For NPs grafted either by PS or PVP homopolymer brushes (selected as a proof of concept), good agreement between the Daoud–Cotton theory, experimental evidence, and our DPD simulations is observed in the scaling behavior of single chain properties, especially for longer grafted chains, and in brush thickness prediction. On the other <b>hand,</b> for <b>grafted</b> chain lengths comparable to NP dimensions parabolic-like profiles of the end-monomer distributions are obtained. Furthermore, a region of high concentration of polymer segments is observed in the monomer density distribution for long homopolymers. In the case of copolymer-decorated NPs, the repulsion between PS and PVP blocks is found to substantially influence the radius of gyration and the shape of the end-monomer distribution of the relevant polymer shell. Moreover, for diblock chains, the un-swollen region is observed to be thinner (and, correspondingly, the swollen layer thicker) than that of a NP modified with a homopolymer of the same length. Finally, the lateral segregation of PS and PVP blocks is evidenced by our calculations and a detailed analysis of the corona behavior is reported, thus revealing the key parameters in controlling the surface properties and the response of diblock copolymer modified nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|Treatment {{of painful}} neuromas {{of the upper}} limb has been largely debated. The current {{surgical}} treatments spare from simple neuroma excision to proximal nerve stump relocation (into muscles, veins, and bones). Perineural fat grafting consists of neuroma excision {{and the creation of}} an autologous adipose graft wrapped around the proximal nerve stump. This technique should be prescribed to those patients suffering from terminal neuromas or neuromas in which functional reconstruction is contraindicated. The effectiveness of this technique could be addressed both to the mechanical and biological properties of the fat <b>graft.</b> On one <b>hand</b> the <b>graft</b> creates a gliding layer and a protective barrier, thus allowing longitudinal excursion and protection against mechanical solicitations. On the other hand the autologous adipose tissue brings neoangiogenesis, modulates the inflammatory response, and avoids scar adherences. A retrospective analysis was performed on 7 neuromas in 7 patients, treated with perineural fat grafting from June 2009 to February 2010. Pain and limb functionality were measured, respectively, with a visual acuity scale and the "Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score," preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. A mean pain reduction of 23 % was recorded, without relevant complications. Improvements in limb functionality were also observed through the measurement of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score, which improved to 18 %.

40|$|Vascularized bone grafts {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied for the reconstruction of bone defects at the forearm, distal radius, carpus, and <b>hand.</b> Vascularized bone <b>grafts</b> are most commonly used in revision cases in which other approaches have failed. Vascularized bone grafts {{can be obtained from}} a variety of donor sites, including the fibula, the iliac crest, the distal radius (corticocancellous segments and vascularized periosteum), the metacarpals and metatarsals, and the medial femoral condyle (corticoperiosteal flaps). Their vascularity is preserved as either pedicled autografts or free flaps to carry the optimum biological potential to enhance union. The grafts can also be transferred as composite tissue flaps to reconstruct compound tissue defects. Selection of the most appropriate donor flap site is multifactorial. Considerations include size matching between donor and defect, the structural characteristics of the graft, the mechanical demands of the defect, proximity to the donor area, the need for an anastomosis, the duration of the procedure, and the donor site morbidity. This article focuses on defects of the distal radius, the wrist, and the hand. (J Hand Surg 2010; 35 A: 1710 - 1718.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the pattern of}} tissue remodeling after maxillary sinus floor elevation using the transalveolar osteotome technique with or without utilizing grafting materials. METHODS: During the period of 2000 - 2005, 252 Straumann dental implants were inserted using the transalveolar sinus floor elevation technique {{in a group of}} 181 patients. For 88 or 35 % of those implants, deproteinized bovine bone mineral with a particle size of 0. 25 - 1 mm was used as the grafting material, but for the remaining 164 implants, no grafting material was utilized. Periapical radiographs were obtained with a paralleling technique and digitized. Two investigators, who were blinded to whether grafting material was used or not, subsequently evaluated the pattern of tissue remodeling. RESULTS: The mean residual bone height was 7. 5 mm (SD 2. 2 mm), ranging from 2 to 12. 7 mm. The mean residual bone height for implants placed with grafting material (6. 4 mm) was significantly less compared with the implants installed without grafting material (8. 1 mm). The implants penetrated on average 3. 1 mm (SD 1. 7 mm) into the sinus cavity. The measured mean radiographic bone gain using the transalveolar technique without grafting material was significantly less, 1. 7 mm (SD 2 mm) compared with a mean bone gain of 4. 1 mm (SD 2. 4 mm), when grafting material was used. Furthermore, the probability of gaining 2 mm or more of new bone was 39. 1 % when no grafting material was used. The probability increased to 77. 9 % when the implants were installed with grafting material. CONCLUSION: When the transalveolar sinus floor elevation was performed without utilizing grafting material, only a moderate gain of new bone could be detected mesial and distal to the implants. On the other <b>hand,</b> when <b>grafting</b> material was used, a substantial gain of new bone was usually seen on the radiographs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a novel and {{efficient}} method of promoting the dispersing uniformity of carbon black (CB) in epoxy polymer substrate of PCB (printed circuit board) by chemical grafting. The reported method shows the promising capability {{in the application}} of advanced printable resistor ink. By taking advantage of the functionalized CB surfaces, the grafting reaction of epoxy polymer on CB particles was investigated with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). FT-IR spectra evidenced the polymerization of epoxy resin with coupling agent and TEM investigation directly confirmed the polymerization occurred on CB surface. The polymerization occurred on the limited part of the CB surfaces to form a network-structure polymer to reside on the CB particles and hence greatly improved CB dispersion in ink as evidenced in ink-droplet spreading verification on glass and PCB resin substrates. On the other <b>hand,</b> the polymer <b>grafting</b> has limited effect on the increasing of the as-cured ink filled with the grafted CBs. Finally, the cross-section observation also confirmed the dispersion improvement and sheet resistance uniformity due to epoxy polymer grafting on PCB substrate, indicating the prospective candidate as embedded resistors for PCB.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{application}} of heat {{on the development}} of graft unions in dormant Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr (Sitka spruce) was observed at monthly intervals from October to March. No advantage over controls was gained in terms of final graft success rates. It is sug-gested that this may have been a result of the mild winter conditions {{during the course of the}} experiment, which enabled callus formation to occur in unheated controls. On the other <b>hand,</b> scions of <b>grafts</b> which had been heated for 3 weeks, and then returned to ambient conditions showed considerably greater growth than unheated controls during the following spring and summer. The amount of extension depended on how late in the winter the graft had been prepared and heated, with least growth by grafts made in October, and most by grafts made in March. Microscopical examination showed that callus forma-tion was more rapid in heated grafts than in controls, although callus formation occurred in all control grafts examined. Heat also induced cambial reactivation and tracheid formation, particularly in the vicinity of needle or bud traces in the scion. In keeping with this, it was found that the presence of needles and buds was essential for cambial reactivation in normal dormant stems and that reactivation was restricted to the heated region...|$|R
30|$|At first, we {{performed}} RITA diagonal bypass. Subsequently, {{we performed}} anastomosis of LITA-LAD bypass. After CABG, {{the patient had}} stable circulation (BP 126 / 54  mmHg, HR 62  bpm) without changes in ST segment as monitored by electrocardiogram. When we examined blood flow of the RITA diagonal bypass, transit time flow measurement revealed reasonable blood flow (flow rate 20  mL/min, pulsative index 3.4, diastolic flow of 82 %). On the other <b>hand,</b> the LITA <b>graft</b> showed comparatively poorer blood flow (flow rate 15  mL/min, pulsative index 2.1, diastolic flow 74 %) than the RITA graft. Flow competition between the RITA and LITA was unlikely to occur considering {{the location of the}} stenotic lesion. In addition, taking into the consideration the perfused region of the LAD and the severe stenosis in the stent, the graft blood flow was too low and technical anastomotic stenosis was suspected. We re-anastomosed the LITA-LAD bypass. However, even after re-anastomosis of LITA-LAD bypass, transit time flow measurement revealed worsening of graft flow compared to before (LITA-LAD: flow rate 7  mL/min, pulsatile index 4.8, diastolic flow 68 %; RITA diagonal: flow rate 11  mL/min, pulsatile index 5.6, diastolic flow 76 %). We immediately closed the wound and moved the patient to a hybrid operating room to examine the causes of this progressively low graft flow.|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1990 ’s, Ivory Coast {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} the ideology of ivoirité, a conception of citizenship based on autochthonous origins. Ivoirité was elaborated by a group of Ivorian intellectuals {{in the context of the}} political struggle opposing Henry Konan Bedié to Alassane Ouattara in the succession to the late president Houphouët-Boigny. Through the tactic use of the rhetorics of ivoirité, Ouattara was depicted by his adversaries as a “Burkinabé” trying to rule the country. Going beyond this tactic aspect, the article addresses the ideological relations linking ivoirité to a “project of a Ivorian liberal society” explicitly constructed by the same intellectuals. These relations contributed to the emergence, in the Ivorian public space, of a discourse establishing self-evident, hegemonic connections between notions like autochthony, modernity, nationality and biopolitical concepts like ‘population’, ‘immigration’, ‘security’ and ‘resources’. Such an emergence is framed in two complementary perspectives: on the one <b>hand</b> focusing its <b>graft</b> on the historical continuity of the political-economic strategies and population policies implemented by colonial governamentality and by postcolonial elites. On the other hand, using Giorgio Agamben’s critical enquiry on citizenship and nationality, the implications of the ivoirité intellectuals in the construction of a national bios is brought to light, and so their contribute to the singling out of a paradigmatic form of bare life...|$|R
