5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage.

For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

25|$|The Privy Council's {{decision}} was delivered by Lord Diplock on 15 October 1980. His Lordship held that in Singapore, the offences of <b>drug</b> <b>possession</b> and drug trafficking are distinct from each other.

Public Prosecutor (1977) and Seow Koon Guan v. Public Prosecutor (1978) were cited as evidence of Singapore courts upholding this distinction. Where the accused {{was found to be}} transporting controlled drugs, it was held that the transporter's purpose would determine whether the offence was one of <b>drug</b> <b>possession</b> or drug trafficking. Trafficking entailed the moving of drugs for the purpose of transferring possession from the mover to some other person, whether this purpose was achieved or not.|$|E
