25|$|Exekias (545-520 BC) is {{generally}} considered to be the absolute master of the black-figure style, which reaches its apex with him. His significance is not only due to his masterful vase painting, but also to his high quality and innovative pottery. He signed 12 of his surviving vessels as potter, two as both painter and potter. Exekias probably had a large {{role in the development of}} Little-master cups and the Type A belly amphora mentioned above, and he possibly invented the calyx krater, at least the oldest existing piece is from his workshop. In contrast to many other comparable craftsmen, as a painter he attached great importance to the careful elaboration of ornaments. The details of his images—horses’ manes, weapons, clothing—are also outstandingly well executed. His scenes are usually monumental and the figures emanate a dignity previously unknown in painting. In many cases he broke with Attic conventions. For his most famous vessel, the Dionysus cup, he was the first to use a coral-red <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> instead of the customary red color. This innovation, as well as his placing of two pairs of eyes on the exterior, connects Exekias with the classic eye cups. Probably even more innovative was his use of the entire inside of the cup for his picture of Dionysus, reclining on a ship from which grapevines sprout. At this time it was in fact customary to decorate the inside surface merely with a gorgon face. The cup is probably one of the experiments undertaken in the pottery district to break new ground before the red-figure style was introduced. He was the first to paint a ship sailing along the rim of a dinos. He only seldom adhered to traditional patterns of depicting customary mythological subjects. His depiction of the suicide of Ajax is also significant. Exekias does not show the act itself, which was in the tradition, but rather Ajax’ preparations. About as famous as the Dionysus cup is an amphora with his visualization of Ajax and Achilles engaged in a board game. Not only is the portrayal detailed, Exekias even conveys the outcome of the game. Almost in the style of a speech balloon he has both players announce the numbers they cast with their dice—Ajax a three and Achilles a four. This is the oldest known depiction of this scene, of which there is no mention in classical literature. No fewer than 180 other surviving vases, dating from the Exekias version up to about 480 BC, show this scene.|$|E

5000|$|Two researchers, an {{architectural}} conservator from Columbia University and a historical architect {{working for the}} (North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center) NAHPC sought to address the attendant difficulties of removing the different layers of paint without further damaging the statue. The researchers finally decided upon an innovative cryogenic removal method, in which liquid nitrogen was sprayed on the paint-covered surface. The liquid nitrogen would em-brittle the layers of the paint at -320 F, causing the cracking paint to lose the adherent properties it once possessed. It was estimated that approximately 3500 gal of liquid nitrogen would be needed for the <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> removal. According to the researchers, [...] "the use of liquid nitrogen in large scale coating removal was somewhat innovative." [...] The moist squirt gun division of the Union Carbide Corporation of Danbury, Connecticut, {{which at the time}} was [...] "the largest producer of liquid atmospheric gases in the United States", donated the liquid nitrogen for the restoration efforts.

40|$|Abstract — Adhesion {{strength}} of exterior or <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> of steel pipes is too important. Increasing of coating adhesion on surfaces {{can increase the}} life time of coating, safety factor of transmitting line pipe and decreasing the rate of corrosion and costs. Preparation of steel pipe surfaces before doing the coating process is done by shot and grit blasting. This is a mechanical way to do it. Some effective parameters on that process, are particle size of abrasives, distance to surface, rate of abrasive flow, abrasive physical properties, shapes, selection of abrasive, kind of machine and its power, standard of surface cleanness degree, roughness, time of blasting and weather humidity. This search intended to find some better conditions which improve the surface preparation, adhesion strength and corrosion resistance of coating.

In this study we report on an analytical high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence method for BPA and its conjugate in human urine and on the application of this method in two student cohorts. Urine, along with information on smoking, alcohol intake, and coffee/tea consumption, was collected in two different years from two different groups of university students, 50 in 1992 and 56 in 1999. Overall, the urinary BPA levels in the students in 1992 were significantly higher than were those in 1999.

40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to measure the amount of γ-decay of several building materials (brick and cement), raw materials (fly-ash and soil), <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> materials (foam [used as a thermal insulator], water-based paints, solvent-based paints and phosphogypsum) from central Turkey, in terms of Bq kg- 1, and to calculate the biological damage caused by this radioactivity. Materials and Methods: Gamma-spectrometry technique has been used throughout the research {{in order to determine the}} activity of natural radionuclides. Later, annual doses were calculated. Results: The average radioactivity values were 632. 2 Bq kg- 1 for fly-ash, 4. 4 Bq kg- 1 for brick, 73. 3 Bq kg- 1 for soil, 306. 6 Bq kg- 1 for cement, 302. 3 Bq kg- 1 for phosphogypsum and 83. 6 Bq kg- 1 for solvent-based paint in the research region. The activity of water-based paint and foam were below MDA 1. The annual effective doses ranged between 0. 009 and 1. 479 mSv y- 1. Conclusions: These results show that annual dose absorbed by inhabitants from construction materials used in central Turkey per kilogram is below 1. 0 mSv y- 1. However, the dose from fly-ash, a component of cement, is generally over this value. Moreover, Hin 2 of phosphogypsum is over the limit, which means it is harmful for the respiratory system.

When students get involved in an issue they find to be exciting, alarming, or important, old classroom facts can generate new levels of interest. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline how the current controversy over Bisphenol-A (BPA) can serve as an interesting and compelling example to demonstrate the real world dynamics of consumer advocacy, industry reaction, scientific debate, and policy consequences. Scientific Origins Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an artificial estrogen. When bonded together in a chain of molecules it forms part of an extraordinarily useful plastiC called polycarbonate. BPA contain ing plastics are used as packaging for thousands of consumer products such as microwave dinners, water bottles, hard plastic baby hottles, <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> for canned food, and in-housing construction products like water pipes and water storage tanks. Early scientific notice of BPA leaching from plastic containers was reported in a 1993 article in the journal of Endocrinology (Krishnan, Stathis, Permuth, Tokes, & Feldman, 1993). These Stanford University scientists were not studying BPA or plastics at all.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of phase change materials (PCM) in construction materials {{contributes to the}} reduction of the energy consummation i the buildings. The needs of heating and cooling systems can be reduced with the adequate use of PCM. Te benefits to the comfort inside buildings appear during the change of phase of the PCM. The transferences of energy that occur during the transitions solid-liquid and liquid-solid are generally the most used to help the acclimatization of the buildings. For that reason the PCM must be microencapsulated. The exterior of the microcapsules is made with a polymer. This study presents the mechanical properties of a cement mortar with the {{incorporation of}} 20 %, 30 % and 40 % of microcapsules of PCM. The aim was to find the maximum percentage to be incorporated in a cement mortar to use in the <b>interior</b> <b>coating</b> of walls.

A range of seaweed species were screened (in live and dried form) for Cu 2 +, Pb 2 + and Cr 3 + removal properties including; (Rhodophytes) Polysiphonia lanosa, Porphyra umbilicalis, Gigartina stellata, Palmaria palmata, Corallina officinalis, Gracilaria verrucosa, (Chlorophytes) Ulva intestinalis, Ulva compressa, Ulva lactuca, (Phaeophytes) Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus. Waste Ascophyllum Product (WAP), from an industrial process, was also screened. Results of batch tests indicated dried seaweed was preferable for utilisation in a biosorption column with WAP, F. vesiculosus and P. lanosa removing 1. 50 mg Cu/g biosorbent, 1. 69 mg Cu/g and 1. 31 mg Cu/g respectively. Pre-exposure of a seaweed species to a metal in live form enhanced the removal of that particular metal when the seaweed was subsequently exposed in dried biomass form. Dried forms of WAP, F. vesiculosus and P. lanosa were each immobilised in agar, K-carrageenan and sodium alginate (all seaweed derivatives) prior to application in a fixed bed biosorption column in order to resist compacting due to hydrostatic pressure hindering flow-through. The agar and carrageenan seaweed biosorbents were formed into 15 mm x 5 mm x 10 mm blocks and the Na alginate seaweeds biosorbents formed 5 mm spheres. The fixed bed packed biosorption column, constructed from 304 grade heat treated SS with a PTFE <b>interior</b> <b>coating,</b> measured 70 mm internal Ø. The biosorbent bed height was 170 mm with a packing density of 260 g L- 1. Each biosorbent was tested separately (4 replicates) in a column by running a 10 mg L- 1 Cu 2 + solution continuously for a period of 3 hours at 25 ml min- 1. The 5 % agar/ 7. 5 % WAP biosorbent demonstrated the highest removal efficiency (RE) of 98 %. Protonated biosorbents showed no significant difference in RE. Further testing of the 5 % agar/ 7. 5 % WAP biosorbent showed overall metal removal values (W) of 269 mg Pb/ g, 91. 3 mg Cu/ g and 57. 4 mg Cr/ g. Breakthrough points (TB) were 6, 124 and 1. 2 hours with exhaustion points (TE) of 96, 218 and 70 hours for Cu, Pb and Cr III respectively.
