5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|The crisis had {{significant}} adverse economic effects and labour market effects, with unemployment rates in Greece and Spain reaching 27%, and was blamed for subdued economic growth, {{not only for}} the entire eurozone, but for the entire European Union. As such, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to have had a major political impact on the ruling governments in 10 out of 19 eurozone countries, contributing to power shifts in Greece, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as outside of the eurozone, in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that private}} charity is {{insufficient}} because {{the benefits from}} it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed {{by the sight of}} poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

50|$|Sights on the ground, {{ranging from}} a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a {{possible}} distraction, although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the former are providing the music for the act.|$|R
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
25|$|This {{philosophy}} of Platonist mathematical realism {{is shared by}} many mathematicians. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.|$|E
50|$|Some {{criticisms of}} ESL design and {{verification}} have been raised. These include too much focus on C-based languages and challenges in representing parallel processes. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that ESL design and verification is {{a subset of}} verification and validation.|$|R

25|$|Increasingly, the Governor-General {{represents}} New Zealand {{abroad and}} is accorded the same respect and privileges {{of a head}} of state. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the de facto head of state is the Governor-General while the de jure head of state remains the Sovereign. The current Governor-General is Her Excellency the Right Honourable Dame Patsy Reddy, GNZM, QSO, DStJ.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} {{presence}} of Robert Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the Kardashian family. While Kardashian's ex-wife Kris Jenner was already married to former Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce) {{at the time of the}} trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.|$|E
50|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the film even decades after its release. It was denounced for misleading audiences {{into believing that}} this seemingly personal account <b>was</b> real.

30|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that microadaptivity <b>is</b> {{best left}} to the instructor.

30|$|Overall, {{our data}} {{indicate}} that incubation can provide generic network resources but {{to a lesser extent}} offers idiosyncratic (non-generic) network resources. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that incubator-provided networks can complement, but not substitute, tenants’ external “private” networks, which appear to be crucial for access to idiosyncratic resources.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that superheroes, the uniquely American {{contribution}} to comic books, owe their origin to New York, {{despite the fact}} that the first superhero, Superman, was created by two artists from Cleveland, Ohio. Even when not based explicitly in New York, superhero stories often make use of recognizable stand-ins for the city, such as Metropolis or Gotham City (Gotham being a common nickname for New York). The form and narrative conventions of superhero stories frequently dictate New York-sized cities as the settings, even generically.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that within}} this {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions {{would be far}} more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can clearly be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{movement in}} modern Persian literature {{centered on the}} question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that power}} <b>is</b> more evenly {{spread out in}} {{parliamentary}} government. The prime minister is seldom as important as a ruling president, and there {{tends to be a}} higher focus on voting for a party and its political ideas than voting for an actual person.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} {{military}} acquiesced to the assumption of Tejada to the presidency {{with the understanding that}} the latter would be far more malleable and agreeable to the wishes of the High Command than Salamanca had been. This indeed proved to be the case.|$|R
30|$|Viable {{admissible}} discontinuity curves {{are nothing}} but solutions of the differential equation. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reasonably <b>argued</b> that viable discontinuity curves {{are unlikely to be}} found in applications. It will, however, remain clear in our final examples that viable curves <b>can</b> <b>be</b> in some cases more useful in applications than inviable ones.|$|R
25|$|Mycorrhizas {{from the}} Miocene exhibit a {{vesicular}} morphology closely resembling that of present Glomerales. This conserved morphology {{may reflect the}} ready availability of nutrients provided by the plant hosts in both modern and Miocene mutualisms. However, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the efficacy of signaling processes {{is likely to have}} evolved since the Miocene, and this can not be detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between symbionts while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion {{in order to justify}} its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that {{political}} factors are important considerations and {{they range from}} the fact that firms often build foreign facilities to avoid trade barriers or take advantage of economic development incentives; most governments—local, state, and national—are concerned with promoting the economic welfare of their citizens (Griffin and Pustay 2002).|$|R
50|$|Report {{generation}} functionality {{is almost}} always present in database systems, where {{the source of the}} data is the database itself. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that report generation is part of the purpose of a spreadsheet.

25|$|Bell {{did for the}} {{telephone}} what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although {{not the first to}} experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Bell invented {{the telephone}} industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.|$|E
25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as a window into the female psyche.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{treatment}} of Kilkenny and Clonmel {{is in contrast}} to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in attitude {{on the part of the}} Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Cromwell's attitude had not changed.|$|E
5000|$|While {{most social}} {{scientists}} today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology {{and political science}} journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument. [...] <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> thus <b>argued</b> that [...] "natural science and social science articles <b>can</b> therefore <b>be</b> regarded with {{a good deal of}} confidence as members of the same genre".|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that social}} promotion, by keeping most {{students}} {{at the elementary school}} level from advancing at their own pace, is the reason they don't take their education seriously. Eliminating the social promotion system would then make the incentives of merit promotion more effective {{at the beginning of each}} student's academic career.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> fairly <b>argued</b> that Southcott {{did not act}} {{unreasonably}} {{in pursuing}} specific performance of the contract. Though the common law presumption of the uniqueness of real property no longer holds, a claim for specific performance may still be reasonable if a property has unique characteristics such that a substitute property is not readily available.|$|R
