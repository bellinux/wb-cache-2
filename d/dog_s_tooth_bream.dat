Triterpene extract (TE) from outer bark of birch consisting mainly of betulin is able to form an oleogel which was successfully tested in the treatment of actinic keratosis. Some aspects of TE in vitro pharmacology are already known. Now we show preliminary pharmacokinetics of betulin and results of a subchronic toxicity study of TE in rats and dogs. Because of poor aqueous solubility of the TE-triterpenes (< 0. 1 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL respectively), for pharmacokinetic studies it was suspended in sesame oil (rats, i. p.) and PEG 400 / 0. 9 % NaCl (<b>dogs,</b> <b>s.</b> c.). I. p. administered, betulin, the main component of TE, shows time dependency over a period of 4 h and reaches a dose-independent serum level of 0. 13 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL. Dose dependency was observed with s. c. administration. At 300 mg/kg a maximum plasma concentration of 0. 33 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL betulin was detected after 28 daily applications. The subchronic toxicity study showed no toxicity of TE in rats (i. p.) and <b>dogs</b> (<b>s.</b> c.).

Hence, the aims of this study were to quantify the extent of asymmetry in tooth eruption and to determine whether eruption asymmetry was significantly influenced by sex, tooth position or timing of emergence. Additionally, directionality of asymmetry and variation between ethnic groups were also explored. Data collection was based on the examination of serial dental casts from a sample of 90 Aborigines (50 male, 40 female) aged 6 to 18 years from the Yuendumu settlement in the Northern Territory of Australia.

Sponsorship: National Science Foundation grants EAR- 0228876 (GSS) and EAR- 0228853 (EEW). Grant number 2002 - 33 of the Ohio University Research Council (GSS); De Beers Africa ExplorationPotholes carved into streambeds can be important components of channel incision, {{but they have}} received little quantitative attention. Here empirical evidence is presented from three sites along the Orange River, Republic of South Africa that demonstrates that the pothole dimensions of radius and depth are strongly correlated using a simple power law. Where radius is the dependent variable, the exponent of the power law describes {{the rate of increase}} in radius with increasing depth. Erosion within potholes is complexly related to erosion on the adjacent bed. Erosion efficiencies within small, hemispherical potholes must be high if the potholes are to survive in the face of bed translation (incision). As potholes deepen, however, the necessary efficiencies decline rapidly. Increasing concavity associated with growth imposes stricter constraints; comparatively deep potholes must erode orders of magnitude larger volumes of substrate than shallower potholes in the face of bed retreat. Hemispherical potholes are eventually converted to cylindrical potholes, the geometries of which favor enlargement while they are small. Geometric models constructed using the power law show unambiguously that more substrate is eroded by volume from cylindrical pothole walls during growth than from cylindrical pothole floors. Grinders thus play a secondary role to suspended sediment entrained within the vortices that occur in potholes. Continued growth leads to coalescence with other potholes or destruction through block detachment depending on local geology. The combination of geology and erosion mechanisms may determine whether a strath or inner channel develops {{as a consequence of the}} process. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The disease is transmitted mostly through the bite of the invertebrate vector, the phlebotomine Lutzomyia longipalpis in the New World. Although the domestic dog is considered the most important reservoir of the disease, other mammalian, including wildlife, are susceptible to infection. The goal {{of this study was to}} perform xenodiagnosis to evaluate the capacity of naturally infected maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) to transmit Leishmania infantum to female sand flies (L. longipalpis). Xenodiagnoses were performed in February and August, 2013, when 77. 7 % (three maned wolves and four bush dogs) or 100 % of the animals were positive, respectively.

Furthermore, methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius is emerging, resembling the human health threat of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore it is increasingly important to characterize targets for intervention strategies to counteract S. pseudintermedius infections. Here we used biophysical methods, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallo-graphy, to define the ligand-binding properties and structure of SitA, an S. pseudintermedius surface lipoprotein. SitA was strongly and specifically stabilized by Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + ions. Crystal structures of SitA complexed with Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + revealed a canonical class III solute-binding protein with the metal cation bound in a cavity between N-and C-terminal lobes. Unexpectedly, one crystal contained both apo- and holo-forms of SitA, revealing a large side-chain reorientation of His 64, and associated structural differences accompanying ligand binding. Such conformational changes may regulate fruitful engagement of the cognate ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter system (SitBC) required for metal uptake. These results provide the first detailed characterization and mechanistic insights for a potential therapeutic target of the major canine pathogen S. pseudintermedius, and also shed light on homologous structures in related staphylococcal pathogens afflicting humans...|$|R
