40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of three dimensions of accounting <b>statement</b> <b>format</b> on the ability of users to extract information from these statements. The three dimensions of format studied were: (1) account v report P & L <b>statement</b> <b>format,</b> (2) account v report Balance Sheet format, and (3) construction signalling. A fourth independent variable studied was learning trials. Results show that (1) the report P & L <b>statement</b> <b>format</b> produces higher extraction performance than the account format, (2) higher construction signalling results in higher extraction performance, and (3) as learning trials increase, extraction performance also increases, but at a decreasing rate. Balance Sheet format does not result in a significant main effect.

However, the method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set entirely (thereby retaining 48 {{as the number of}} lexical characters, which the colon had increased to 49). This was considered beneficial in that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to use the notorious GO TO statement as before.

40|$|Historically, the <b>format</b> of {{financial}} <b>statements</b> has varied {{from one country}} to another. Recently, due to the attractiveness of their capital markets, the strength of their accounting professions and the influence of their institutional investors, Anglo-American countries have seen the impact of their accounting practices on other nations increase steadily, even influencing the actual <b>format</b> {{of financial}} <b>statements.</b> Given that French accounting regulations allow a certain degree of choice in consolidated balance sheet format (‘by nature' or ‘by term') and income <b>statement</b> <b>format</b> (‘by nature' or ‘by function'), this study examines a sample of 199 large French listed firms in an attempt to understand why some of these firms do not use the traditional French formats (‘by nature' for the balance sheet and ‘by nature” for the income statement), instead preferring Anglo-American practices (‘by term' format for the balance sheet and ‘by function' format for the income statement). We first analyze the balance sheet and income <b>statement</b> <b>formats</b> separately using a logit model, then combine the two and enrich the research design with a generalized ordered logit model and a multinomial logit regression. Our results confirm that the major driving factor behind the adoption of one or two alternative formats is the firm's degree of internationalization, not only financial (auditor type, foreign listing and the decision to apply alternative accounting standards) but also commercial (company size and the internationalization of sales) ...|$|R
