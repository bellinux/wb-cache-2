Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour <b>digital</b> <b>mapping</b> and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

It {{is well known that}} the accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> produced from satellite images is decided largely by the accuracy of geometric modelling. However <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> are made by a series of photogrammetric workflow. Therefore the accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> are also affected by the quality of satellite images, such as image interpretability. For satellite images, parameters such as Modulation Transfer Function(MTF), Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) and Ground Sampling Distance(GSD) are used to present images quality. Our previous research stressed that such quality parameters may not represent the quality of image products such as <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> and that parameters for image interpretability such as Ground Resolved Distance(GRD) and National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale(NIIRS) need to be considered. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the image quality on accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> produced by satellite images. QuickBird, IKONOS and KOMPSAT- 2 imagery were used to analyze as they have similar GSDs. We measured various image quality parameters mentioned above from these images.

We analyzed the accuracy of the <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> in terms of their location accuracy and their level of details.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of the Internet and portable multimedia terminals, the concept of GIS has been introduced to many aspects of our daily life. Although the <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> and GIS service systems abruptly increased on the Internet, the vast amount of geographical information data and the limited speed of the service cause problems when the GIS data for the actual users are transmitted through the Internet and saved in the portable terminals in a short time. In this study, the most efficient technique to transmit the large-volume GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> images is identified to address such problems. First, the file-based <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> v 2. 0 and shape files, the XML-based 3 DF-GML, GML, CityGML and KML, and the database-based geodatabase files are used to form layers in the 3 D GIS engine, and the data are transmitted to the simulator. Second, there is the streaming technique for the <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> screen images. In this method, the administrator and users connect to the server, and the 3 D GIS engine and diverse GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> information on the administrator screen are transmitted to the users in the forms of screen captures or streaming service. In this study, {{the characteristics of the}} two methods are examined, and the more efficient way to deliver the GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> information is determined. The detailed features of the chosen large-volume GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> transmission method are designed, and the items that should be considered are identified...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years {{there has been}} a rapid {{increase}} in the development and use of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> for teaching and learning in Higher Education. There is also a political drive to encourage and foster best practice in this area. This is part of a more general initiative on fostering the development and demonstrating the impact of the use of digital resources in education, as evidenced by recent funding programmes by JISC 1 in the UK and NSF 2 in the US. This paper presents and discusses the evaluation of digital resources to support the use of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> for learning. First it reviews the use of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> for learning, outlining the features that make them powerful tools, before then considering the more general literature on learners’ use of maps which suggests that although they have great potential, the use of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> by learners may not be straightforward.

The project includes teaching case studies of how such resources can be used and have been used in practice.
