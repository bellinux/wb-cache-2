40|$|The cuticle of land {{plants is}} the first {{physical}} barrier to protect their aerial parts from biotic and abiotic stresses. <b>DEWAX,</b> an AP 2 /ERF-type transcription factor, negatively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis. In this study, we investigated the resistance to Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa overexpressing <b>DEWAX</b> and in Arabidopsis <b>dewax</b> mutant. Compared to wild type (WT) leaves, Arabidopsis <b>DEWAX</b> OX and <b>dewax</b> leaves were more and less permeable to toluidine blue dye, respectively. The ROS levels increased in <b>DEWAX</b> OX leaves, but decreased in <b>dewax</b> relative to WT leaves. Compared to WT, <b>DEWAX</b> OX was more resistant, while <b>dewax</b> was more sensitive to B. cinerea; however, defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 :GFP were inversely modulated. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that the expression of defense-related genes was upregulated in <b>DEWAX</b> OX, but downregulated in <b>dewax</b> relative to WT. Transactivation assay showed that <b>DEWAX</b> upregulated the expression of PDF 1. 2 a, IGMT 1, and PRX 37. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that <b>DEWAX</b> directly interacts with the GCC-box motifs of PDF 1. 2 a promoter. In addition, ectopic expression of <b>DEWAX</b> increased the tolerance to B. cinerea in C. sativa. Taken together, we suggest that increased ROS accumulation and DEWAX-mediated upregulation of defense-related genes are closely associated with enhanced resistance to B. cinerea in Arabidopsis and C. sativa...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerial parts}} of plants are {{protected}} from desiccation and other stress by surface cuticular waxes. The total cuticular wax loads and the expression of wax biosynthetic genes are significantly downregulated in Arabidopsis thaliana under dark conditions. We isolated Decrease Wax Biosynthesis (<b>DEWAX),</b> which encodes an AP 2 /ERF-type transcription factor that is preferentially expressed in the epidermis and induced by darkness. Disruption of <b>DEWAX</b> leads {{to an increase in}} total leaf and stem wax loads, and the excess wax phenotype of <b>dewax</b> was restored to wild type levels in complementation lines. Moreover, overexpression of <b>DEWAX</b> resulted in a reduction in total wax loads in leaves and stems compared with the wild type and altered the ultrastructure of cuticular layers. <b>DEWAX</b> negatively regulates the expression of alkane-forming enzyme, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, ATP citrate lyase A subunit, enoyl-CoA reductase, and fatty acyl-CoA reductase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that <b>DEWAX</b> directly interacts with the promoters of wax biosynthesis genes. Cuticular wax biosynthesis is negatively regulated twice a day by the expression of <b>DEWAX,</b> throughout the night and at stomata closing. Significantly higher levels (10 - to 100 -fold) of <b>DEWAX</b> transcripts were found in leaves than in stems, suggesting that DEWAX-mediated transcriptional repression may be an additional mechanism contributing to the different total wax loads in leaves and stems...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of the alkali-treatment and its {{variables}} viz., time and concentration of alkali, on the creep properties of jute fibre were studied.

In the 8 hrs treated fibres, the creep was slightly more than the 20 mins treated fibres.

40|$|Abstract—Several {{studies have}} shown {{selective}} preservation of plant cuticular materials in soils. However, very {{little is known about}} their function as sorbents for the hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in the soil. In this study, we investigated the sorption and desorption of phenanthrene and atrazine by cuticular fractions of pepper (bulk, <b>dewaxed,</b> nonsaponifiable, and non-hydrolyzable) to better understand the sorptive activity of cuticular matter in soils. The bulk and <b>dewaxed</b> cuticles exhibited carbon-normalized distribution coefficients (Koc) for phenanthrene and atrazine in the range of that reported for soil humic substances, although both samples were rich in aliphatic structures. No hysteresis was observed in the desorption isotherms of either solute. The nonhydrolyzable residue exhibited a very high Koc value for atrazine, whereas the nonsaponifiable sample exhibited the lowest Koc value for both sorbates. Based on solubility parameter data, it is suggested that the nonsaponifiable sample be considered an intermediate between the physical and chemical mixture of pectin and cutan/lignin-like fractions, whereas the <b>dewaxed</b> cuticle is a chemical blending of cutin and pectin. The n-hexane-normalized sorption data suggest that the pepper cuticle can interact specifically with atrazine. This study leads {{to the conclusion that the}} contribution of aliphatic-rich plant biopolymers to the sorption of HOCs can be significant because of their preservation and accumulation in soils.

The plant surface is usually covered with epicuticular waxes (EWs), which are not only involved in water physiology, but also provide resistance to insects. In the present work the probing behaviour and performance of the aphid Chaitophorus leucomelas Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on <b>dewaxed</b> and waxed leaves of two poplar hybrids, [(Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray · Populus deltoides Bartram ex Marshall) · P. deltoides] (TD · D) and [(P. trichocarpa · Populus maximowiczii Henry) · (P. trichocarpa · P. maximowiczii) ] (TM · TM), previously repor-ted as susceptible and resistant, respectively, are described.

40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of addition of organic fibre on the mechanical properties of the investment casting ceramic mould based on different length of fibres in the investment. Modulus of rupture (MOR) and permeability of the ceramic mould are evaluated. The MOR test contains three systems: green (undewaxed), green (<b>dewaxed)</b> and fired. The permeability test contains two systems: green (<b>dewaxed)</b> and fired. For the variation of fibre length, 3 mm, 5 mm, 7 mm, 9 mm are established. In each system, the MOR and permeability are compared between the fibre addition specimens and the non fibre addition specimen.
