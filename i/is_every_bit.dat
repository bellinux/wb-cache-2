500|$|AMBI Pictures {{announced}} in November 2015 that {{it plans to}} remake Memento, one of several film rights that AMBI acquired from its acquisition of Exclusive Media. Monika Bacardi, an executive for AMBI Pictures, stated that they plan to [...] "stay true to Christopher Nolan's vision and deliver a memorable movie that <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as edgy, iconic and award-worthy as the original".|$|E

500|$|IGN's Moriarty {{thought that}} New Marais was more living and {{breathing}} than Empire City {{and the overall}} look of the game was improved over the original. Game Informers Reiner saw {{the city as a}} [...] "sightseeing marvel." [...] GameSpy's McGarvery found the game was much cleaner-looking than the first. GameSpot's Mc Shea noted the city's neighborhoods were varied and felt alive, and found the visuals [...] "great-looking". Eurogamer's Donlan wrote [...] "New Marais <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good at its job as Empire City was".|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation Vita {{version of}} the game was also well received. Dan Ryckert of Game Informer called it [...] "the most {{complete}} version of Mortal Kombat available," [...] while Brett Zeidler of Destructoid hailed it as [...] "a perfect example of keeping the best graphical fidelity possible and including an already astronomical amount of content." [...] According to Walton, [...] "despite a few control issues" [...] regarding tag team combos, [...] "Mortal Kombat on the Vita <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> the great and gruesome fighter as its console counterparts." [...] Steven Hopper of IGN recommended this [...] "great port" [...] {{for those who did}} not play the original release enough.|$|E
500|$|Hillary Goldstein of IGN {{praised the}} comic book, {{saying that it}} [...] "is truly {{the cream of the}} crop when it comes to Vertigo books. Neil Gaiman's work on the series is {{considered}} legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E

This {{was followed by a}} series of concerts, including at the IndigO2 in London, and a performance in Anchorage, Alaska. Reviews of B-Sides and Rarities were generally good; Devin Grant of The Post and Courier wrote that [...] "For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good, and every bit as fun, as the band's previous studio releases", while Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post noted that, although several live tracks reduced the album's strength, [...] "there are still enough charming nuggets to make this album less disposable than the typical rarities compilation".|$|E
500|$|Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama {{there is a sense}} of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] It is light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek ... <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better".|$|E
500|$|Production and {{lighting}} designer Roy Bennett used Clay Paky's A.leda B-Eye K20 LED-based moving lights and Clay Paky Sharpys as lighting attachments. Also around 120 B-Eyes by PKG, {{were obtained for}} the tour as well with lighting control from three full-sized grandMA2s and 10 NPUs. According to lighting programmer Jason Baeri, [...] "Bennett's approach to the show was {{to make it an}} immersive rave that reflected Gaga's non-stop party aesthetic... That means active, alive, vibrant and high energy—it requires us to be just as active on stage as in the crowd. The audience <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as much a set piece as they are a room of spectators, so we had to include them as part of Gaga's same party not just watching the spectacle from afar. Cue wise, that's almost like programming two shows at once: Both had to behave as one cohesive element." ...|$|E

500|$|Transformers: The Ride {{has been}} praised by media around the world. Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times {{said he had}} high {{expectations}} of the ride, and was very pleased with it, and wrote that it [...] "ranks among the top theme park attractions in the world". Martin Miller, also of the Los Angeles Times, was equally pleased with the ride, and called it [...] "one of Universal's most sophisticated, satisfying rides". Miller acknowledged the long queues associated with the ride but commended Universal for the design and theming of the queue to combat this. John Chan of CNET stated Transformers: The Ride [...] "isn't as heart-stopping as a roller coaster [...] the (relatively) long 4-minute ride <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as entertaining". Florida Todays Tim Walters and Jennifer Sangalang stated the [...] "action-packed 'Transformers' ride doesn't disappoint". Both praised the ride's [...] "fun factor" [...] giving it a rating of 5/5, with Walters and Sangalang giving ratings of 4 1/2 and 4 overall, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Mockingjay has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Some {{noted that there}} was a suspense drop between Catching Fire and the start of Mockingjay. Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, [...] "Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot". Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it [...] "the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the [...] "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are looking for and that [...] "it will grab them and not let go". Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as original as the first in the series, ending the review with [...] "Wow".|$|E
500|$|Myst was {{generally}} praised by critics. Computer Gaming World in 1993 assured readers {{that the game}} was not like other CD-ROM games that were [...] "high on glitz and low on substance ... Myst is everything it's touted to be and is, quite simply, the best [...] CD-ROM game". It praised the game's open world nature, lack of death, and [...] "straightforward and simple" [...] storyline. The magazine stated that the [...] "mesmerizing" [...] and [...] "stunning" [...] graphics and sound were [...] "not {{the star of the}} show ... the substance of the game <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good as its packaging", and concluded that Myst [...] "is bound to set a new standard". Myst was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1993 [...] "Adventure Game of the Year" [...] award, which ultimately went to [...] and Day of the Tentacle (tie). In 1996, the magazine ranked it 11th on its list of the most innovative computer games.|$|E

[...] Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard Snow White set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it {{in a class by}} itself." [...] The film won the Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, the first Disney film to win either.|$|E
500|$|Atkin {{found the}} cockpit and terrain {{graphics}} to look [...] "almost real". He commented, [...] "Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the 'sets new standards for graphics' cliché, and Flight Unlimited is the 1995 entry in this club." [...] Bob and John Nolan called Flight Unlimited [...] "the ultimate show off piece for your new Pentium", thanks to [...] "unbelievable" [...] graphics superior to those of any other computer game. Gaudiosi concurred: he characterized the visuals as [...] "photo-sharp" [...] and [...] "better than any I have seen". PC Magazines staff found the graphics [...] "impressive" [...] and [...] "even more stunning than those in Microsoft Flight Simulator". Ware noted the [...] "stunning 3-D photo-realistic scenery", while Bailey stated that the [...] "graphics are brilliantly rendered and whiz by smoothly". Buchanan called Flight Unlimiteds terrain [...] "just superb" [...] and Vizard described it as [...] "amazingly real". Buchanan believed that [...] "what you hear in Flight Unlimited <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good as what you see", thanks to [...] "utterly convincing" [...] sound effects. Atkin praised the instructor as [...] "one of the best uses of voice ever in a multimedia title".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Terri Schwartz {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.8 out of 10, calling the {{blackout}} plot [...] "fairly throwaway" [...] but a backdrop to [...] "tell {{far more interesting}} stories", with Luna's Reyes continuing to be the strongest new element of the season. Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended up feeling like three disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] our idea of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up". Fitzpatrick did think that the introduction of Nagra would [...] "help Season 4 find its footing again" [...] with a more focused overarching story.|$|E

5000|$|Dane took a {{break from}} her film career when she married bandleader Tommy Dorsey; the {{marriage}} lasted from April 1943 to September 1947. Dane <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as forthright and exhibitionistic as Dorsey, and Dorsey loved to show her off to friends, according to Dorsey biographer Peter J. Levinson.|$|R
5000|$|Box Office Magazine's Pete Hammond commented [...] "'The Palace' is riveting, suspenseful {{first class}} filmmaking. In just its short running time it manages to <b>be</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as accomplished, {{compelling}} and provocative as any full-length feature. 'The Palace' marks {{the emergence of}} a major filmmaker in Anthony Maras." ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for The Times, {{journalist}} David Chater highlighted The Most Hated Family in America among selections for [...] "Chater's Choice". Chater commented, [...] "Louis Theroux [...] undertakes his ugliest {{assignment to}} date." [...] Chater concluded, [...] "Theroux deploys all his logic and charm {{to find the}} humanity beneath the rhetoric, but ultimately fails. It is difficult to reason with {{people who think that}} holding up a placard proclaiming 'Jews worship the rectum' is 'a courteous and loving' thing to do." [...] The film was highlighted in the Liverpool Echo as [...] "Sunday's: Pick of the day". Peter Grant of the Liverpool Echo commented, [...] "Louis Theroux took a trip to Kansas for his documentary, The Most Hated Family in America. His profile of Westboro Baptist Church, the home of America's most fanatical Christian fundamentalists, was astonishing." [...] Karl French of Financial Times selected the film as his [...] "Critic's Choice". French wrote positively of the documentary, [...] "After painting himself into an oddball- documentary corner a few years back, Theroux wisely took a long break, and he's come back refreshed, as confirmed by this film. In the way it reveals the comic horror inherent in all forms of zealotry, it <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as compelling as Theroux's recent Vegas documentary." [...] The Mail on Sunday critic Tom Cox rated the documentary as four out of four stars. Cox wrote of Theroux, [...] "His attempts to challenge the beliefs of the Phelps clan – a 71-strong congregation who picket military funerals with 'America Is Doomed' signs – and fuddle them with good nature and erudition were impressive, but ultimately as futile as an attempt to teach a cat algebra." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} about the season, though. The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland was unsure whether the series' success in Canada would follow when it began airing in the US. [...] "As popular as Degrassi was, {{it was still a}} mere cult hit in the United States; the crowd that had access to it initially on PBS {{might not be able to}} tune into [...] Soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi's older fans". She was, however, [...] "happy [...] chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang for another nauseating go-round". Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama there is a sense of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek [...] <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better". After watching nearly seventy hours of twenty-one Canadian-produced programs, the Simon Fraser University cited Degrassi: The Next Generation in their report as one of the Canadian television programmes that is [...] "too Caucasian".|$|E
500|$|Amiga Format {{stated that}} this [...] "fine {{adventure}} game well worth investigating" [...] could compete with Sierra and LucasFilm games; [...] "in any event, Temptress surpasses almost anything Sierra have offered, by being larger, funnier, {{and a whole}} lot better drawn ... an innovative system knocks spots of the Sierra-standards and shows LucasFilm a thing or two" [...] and also praised its humour, saying that there's [...] "a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humour and fairy-tale nonsense." [...] The One praised the game's controls, saying that [...] "the game's impressive user-friendliness is undoubtably one of its strong points," [...] adding that [...] "Lure of the Temptress <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently" [...] but [...] "Lure is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre" [...] and that [...] "LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences." [...] Amiga Power praised its graphics, saying they are [...] "very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best graphic adventures ever" [...] that's [...] "up there with Monkey Island 1 and Beneath a Steel Sky," [...] and adding that the [...] "only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure." [...] Mega Zone praised the game, stating that it is a [...] "Sierra/Lucasfilmish with really, really good playability. We're talking 32 colours graphics which look really nice, with playability which is really smooth, and simply pure gaming enjoyment here," [...] adding that [...] "the manual is very well written, the sound the graphics are all there, disc access is very good, and looking at the way the whole game is put together right down to the intro it's one of the most amazing Amiga Adventures every written! An Adventure Zone classic!" [...] Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power opined that Core Design's rival 1992 fantasy adeventure game Curse of Enchantia (also published by Virgin) was [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." ...|$|E
