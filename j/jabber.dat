Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E

Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com gave the episode a positive review as well, calling it [...] "a welcome {{return to a}} more old school Simpsons storytelling style, capable of being both comical, and, in its own bizarro way, touching." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "While Season 13 doesn’t threaten to approach the high standards of the series’ strongest years, episodes like “Shut” help make it better than expected. Sure, it follows fairly predictable patterns, but it develops them in a satisfying comedic manner."

[...] Nate Boss of Project-Blu described it as [...] "A random episode, without many laughs," [...] however, he added that it [...] "could have been worse."
