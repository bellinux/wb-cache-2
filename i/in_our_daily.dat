It also worked in many other ways and offered a fine show." [...] Writing for MacLean's magazine, Jaime J. Weinman described [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment" [...] as [...] "the first truly great episode— the one that established The Simpsons as the funniest and most multi-layered sitcom around.
