40|$|Preeclampsia {{has become}} the world's major {{maternal}} health problem putting a huge burden on mothers, newborns and also on the health systems. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia seems to include events in very early pregnancy affecting differentiation of placental villous trophoblast. The arising changes of the cell death spectrum from apoptosis via increased autophagy and aponecrosis to necrosis in turn induce systemic inflammation of the mother. Placental tissue samples and maternal serum samples from 40 pregnant women were collected from normal pregnancy, IUGR, early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia. Immunohistochemistry for LC 3 B and Beclin- 1 was quantified using systematic random sampling techniques. Serum levels of LDH and other markers were assessed in serum. Expression of the autophagy markers LC 3 B and Beclin- 1 was significantly different between groups as was the LC 3 B/Beclin- 1 ratio. Early-onset preeclampsia and IUGR had the highest autophagy protein expression levels, while normal pregnancy and late-onset preeclampsia had the highest LC 3 B/Beclin- 1 ratio. Early-onset preeclampsia had the highest negative correlation with free LDH as cell <b>defect</b> <b>marker.</b> Autophagy plays {{a critical role in}} the cell death spectrum and cellular survival capacity of villous trophoblast.

40|$|AbstractAnalysis of {{the live}} {{attenuated}} pseudorabies virus (PrV) vaccine strain Bartha indicated {{location of a}} major determinant for PrV neurovirulence within the genomic BamHI fragment 4 (B. Lomniczi et al., 1984, J. Virol. 52, 198 - 205). To more precisely localize the <b>defect,</b> <b>marker</b> rescue experiments were performed using cloned subfragments of BamHI- 4. Rescuants were analyzed after intracerebral infection for their virulence in chicken, as well as after intranasal infection for virulence in pigs. We show that the defect associated with attenuation in strain Bartha {{is located in a}} 3. 8 -kb subfragment of BamHI 4 which encompasses the PrV UL 20 and UL 21 genes and a putative origin of replication (B. Klupp, H. Kern, and T C mettenleiter, 1992, Virology 191, 900 - 908). Sequence analysis of this region of the strain Bartha genome and comparison with the corresponding region in wild-type PrV strain Ka revealed the presence of eight point mutations. Four nucleotide exchanges reside within the UL 21 gene with three of them leading to amino acid substitutions; one is located in the intergenic region between the UL 20 and UL 21 genes and three are localized downstream from the UL 21 gene. Neither the UL 20 gene nor the putative origin sequence was affected. Insertional inactivation of the UL 21 gene in wild-type PrV strain Ka led to a marked attenuation of the virus for pigs infected by the intranasal route. In summary, our data show that the PrV UL 21 gene is a major determinant of PrV virulence and that point mutations affecting the UL 21 gene of live vaccine strain Bartha contribute to its attenuated phenotype...|$|E

Concepts of tight focusing or non-diffractive propagation carry in consequence a strong potential. Knowledge of the propagation of Gauss and Bessel beams at the focus where the laser-material interaction regime can sustain for either short or higher propagation distances becomes essential. We study the material interaction with ultrafast Bessel and Gaussian beams at different energy and focusing conditions and their impact in the various photoinscription regimes, i. e. formation of isotropic type-I refractive index structures or non-isotropic nanoscale modulated type II structures. To understand the formation mechanisms of these different interaction regimes, we propose probing the ultrafast dynamics of these structures using time-resolved microscopy and spectral imaging in fused silica. Single and multi pulse measurements around the damage threshold can give information about the relaxation mechanisms leading to permanent refractive index changes accompanied by structure characteristic <b>defect</b> <b>markers.</b> Also we figure out key mechanisms in excitation and relaxation dynamics associated with Gaussian and Bessel beam propagation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the room temperature diffusion and trapping phenomena of ion beam generated point defects in crystalline Si by monitoring their interaction with dopants, native contaminants such as C and O, and other defects. Spreading resistance measurements show that a small fraction (similar to 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6)) of the defects generated at the surface by a 40 keV Si implant is injected into the bulk. These defects undergo trap-limited diffusion and produce dopant deactivation and/or partial annihilation of preexisting deep (several micron) <b>defect</b> <b>markers,</b> produced by MeV He implants. It is found that in highly pure, epitaxial Si layers, these effects extend to several microns from the surface, demonstrating a long range migration of point defects at room temperature. A {{detailed analysis of the}} experimental evidences allows us to identify the Si self-interstitials injected into the bulk as the major responsible of both dopant deactivation and partial annealing of vacancy-type defects (divacancies, phosphorus-vacancy and oxygen-vacancy) generated by the implants. Finally, a lower limit of similar to 6 x 10 (- 11) cm(2) /s is obtained for the room temperature diffusivity of Si self-interstitials...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to structurally characterize these sites of chondrogenesis and to investigate the effects of chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP) /blood implants on their formation. MethodThirty-two New Zealand White rabbits received bilateral cartilage defects bearing four subchondral drill holes. One knee per rabbit was treated by solidifying a chitosan-GP/blood implant over the defect. After 1 – 56 days of repair, chondrogenic foci were characterized by histostaining and immunostaining. Collagen fiber orientation was characterized by polarized light microscopy. ResultsGlycosaminoglycan and collagen type II were present throughout the foci while the upper zone expressed collagen type I and the lower zone collagen type X. Large chondrogenic foci had a stratified structure with flatter cells closer to the articular surface, and round or hypertrophic chondrocytes deeper in the drill holes that showed signs of calcification after 3 weeks of repair in control <b>defects.</b> <b>Markers</b> for pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes (Patched) and for proliferation (Ki- 67) were detected within foci. Some cells displayed a columnar arrangement where collagen was vertically oriented. For treated defects, chondrogenic foci appeared 1 – 3 weeks later, foci were nascent and mature rather than resorbing, and foci developed closer to the articular surface. ConclusionsChondrogenic foci bear some similarities to growth cartilage and can give rise to a repair tissue that has similar zonal stratification as articular cartilage. The temporal and spatial formation of chondrogenic foci can be modulated by cartilage repair therapies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNonlinear {{propagation}} of intense ultrafast laser pulses inside transparent materials {{has a strong}} influence on the fabrication quality and accuracy in 3 D laser-material processing. The ability to maintain near-constant intensity profiles over an appreciable distance along the propagation direction, sustaining nonlinear absorption, recommends ultrafast Bessel beams for high aspect ratio submicron structuring applications. We discuss here {{the characteristics of the}} interaction of transparent materials, especially fused silica, with ultrafast non-diffractive beams of moderate and high cone angle at various laser energies and pulse durations. We define their impact on photoinscription regimes, i. e. formation of isotropic and non-isotropic refractive index structures (Fig. 1) and the stability limits. The laser pulse duration was observed to be key in deciding the type and morphology of the structures. In particular, high aspect ratio void-like structures with submicron cores (down to 100 nm) over hundreds of microns are produced when using laser pulse of longer pulse duration, highlighting the important contribution of delayed ionization and light diffusion on excited carriers. On the contrary, for the same energy, smooth refractive index modified structures are produced for short laser pulses. To understand the formation mechanisms of these structures, we studied the ultrafast dynamics of excitation around the modification threshold using time-resolved microscopy and spectral imaging techniques. We reveal various relaxation mechanisms leading to either permanent refractive index changes accompanied by structural characteristic <b>defect</b> <b>markers</b> or to hydrodynamic phenomena and cavitation in hot states. We observe fast carrier trapping in structural matrix deformations for soft positive index changes accompanied by the formation of non-bridging oxygen centers and long living carriers characteristic of "phase" transition and hydrodynamic expansion for void-like domains. To illustrate the respective material changes we compare the ultrafast laser material interaction mechanisms in terms of energy deposition and relaxation characteristics in fused silica associated with Bessel beams [1].

Since humans vary in their tendency to clot due to a variety of inherited or acquired defects, we investigated whether a prothrombotic state increases the chance of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and/or worsens the prognosis of IPF. METHODS: We recruited 211 incident cases of IPF and 256 age-and sex-matched general population controls and collected data on medical history, medication, smoking habit, blood samples as well as lung function and high-resolution CT scans done as part of routine clinical care. A prothrombotic state was defined as the presence of at least one inherited or acquired clotting <b>defect</b> or <b>marker</b> of fibrinolytic dysfunction. We used logistic regression to quantify the association between a prothrombotic state and IPF adjusted for age, sex, smoking habit and highly sensitive C reactive protein.

40|$|Mutations in the DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system {{lead to an}} instability of simple repetitive DNA sequences involved in several cancer types. This instability is reflected in a high mutation rate of microsatellites, and recent studies in colon cancer indicate that defects in MMR result in frequent frameshift mutations in mononucleotide repeats located in the coding regions of BAX and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor genes. Circumstantial {{evidence suggests that the}} MMR defect may be involved in some lymphoid malignancies, although several allelotype analyses have concluded on the low level of microsatellite instability in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To further evaluate the implication of MMR defects in leukemogenesis, we have studied a series of 98 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 14 leukemic cell lines using several indicators of MMR <b>defects.</b> Microsatellite <b>markers</b> were compared between blast and normal DNA from the same patients and mutations were sought in mononucleotide repeat sequences of BAX and TGF-beta receptor II (TGF-beta RII).

Disruption of the Hippo pathway, including major components Hippo, Salvador, and Warts, results in aberrant follicle-cell differentiation and proliferation and dramatic disruption of the oocyte anterior-posterior axis.

The most common, genetically highly heterogeneous form of autosomal recessive CL, ARCL 2, is frequently associated with variable metabolic and neurological symptoms. Progeroid symptoms, dysmorphic features, hypotonia and psychomotor retardation are highly overlapping in the early phase of these disorders. This makes the genetic diagnosis often challenging. In search for discriminatory symptoms, we prospectively evaluated clinical, neurologic, metabolic and genetic features in our patient cohort referred for suspected ARCL. From a cohort of 26 children, we confirmed mutations in genes associated with ARCL in 16 children (14 probands), including 12 novel mutations. Abnormal glycosylation and gyration abnormalities were mostly, but not always associated with ATP 6 V 0 A 2 mutations. Epilepsy was most common in ATP 6 V 0 A 2 defects.

40|$|In England, the 18 th and 19 th centuries marked an {{increase}} in urban living {{and the development of}} industrialisation. The movement of large numbers of individuals into newly created urban, industrial centres led to a decline in the standard of living conditions. In overcrowded towns, infectious disease easily spread amongst the improperly fed masses exposed to air and water pollution from nearby factories. To investigate the effects of these poor living conditions on populations in the post-medieval period, the prevalence of congenital defects, anomalies present at or before birth, were chosen for study in skeletal remains. Using an analysis of the prevalence of congenital defects, the hypothesis tested was {{that there should be a}} greater prevalence of congenital defects in people in urban centres due to the inferred poor state of health present there at the time compared to individuals from rural areas who may not have been as heavily exposed to unsanitary environmental conditions. 	This research focused on populations from four sites in Northeast England. The two urban sites were the Quaker burial ground, Coach Lane, North Shields (1711 - 1857 AD) and St Hilda’s, Coronation Street, South Shields (1816 - 1856 AD), both in Tyne and Wear. The two rural sites were St Michael and St Lawrence, Fewston (post-medieval- 1896 AD) and St Martin, Wharram Percy (1540 - 1850 AD), both in North Yorkshire. Collected data showed that there was no statistical difference between prevalence rates at the urban and rural sites for individual or combined defects. This may indicate that the quality of the living conditions were similarly detrimental to health at both site types and raises the issue of how urban and rural can be better defined for the post-medieval period. Furthermore, these findings call into question the use of congenital <b>defects</b> as <b>markers</b> of overall health unless combined with “stress” indicator data and research into past living conditions. ...|$|R

To determine if Mcl- 1 has a specific role in normal keratinocyte (KC) biology, Mcl- 1 was downregulated in human KCs by RNAi and these KCs were induced to differentiate in organotypic raft cultures. Mcl- 1 shRNA organotypic cultures showed increased levels of spontaneous premature apoptosis, implicating Mcl- 1 as an essential KC survival protein. Mcl- 1 -downregulated cultures also had reduced granular and cornified layers, and produced lower levels of cross-linked protein and cornified envelopes. Cornification could only partially be rescued with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD, suggesting that reduced cornification was not entirely because of premature apoptosis. Differentiation markers (K 1, K 10, filaggrin, loricrin, cleaved caspase- 14) were normally expressed in control organotypic cultures, but were expressed at reduced levels in organotypic cultures with downregulated Mcl- 1. The <b>defect</b> in differentiation <b>marker</b> expression was independent of apoptosis as {{it could not be}} rescued by z-VAD.

Recombination between the repeated elements generated a plasmid with a precise deletion and a characteristic restriction pattern, which distinguished the recombined molecules from those with other <b>defects</b> in the <b>marker</b> gene. Recombination among the following different sequences was measured in this assay: (i) the simian virus 40 origin and enhancer region, (ii) the AGMK Alu sequence, and (iii) a sequence from plasmid pBR 322.

The frequency of the latter class was unaffected by the presence of the option for recombination represented by the direct repeats. Both recombination and deletion-insertion mutagenesis were stimulated by double-strand cleavage between the repeated sequences and adjacent to the marker, and the frequency of the deletion-insertion mutants in this experiment was again independent of the presence of the direct repeats.

Of interest, the relatively preserved lipidomic profile in islets from young POKO mice contrasted with the large changes in lipid composition and the differences in the chain length of triacylglycerols in the serum, liver, muscle and adipose tissue in adult POKO mice. Later lipotoxic insults in adult β cells contribute to the failure of the POKO β cell. Our results indicate that the rapid development of insulin resistance and β-cell failure in POKO mice makes this model a useful tool to study early molecular events leading to insulin resistance and β-cell failure. Furthermore, comparisons with ob/ob mice might reveal important adaptive mechanisms in β cells with either therapeutic or diagnostic potential...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{processes}} {{can cover}} {{a wide range}} of separation problems [with a specific membrane (membrane structure) required for every problem]. Thus, there are membranes available that differ in their structure and consequently in the functionality. Therefore membrane characterization is necessary to ascertain, which membrane may be used for a certain separation. Membranes of pore size ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm with a uniform pore size are very important in membrane technology. An optimum performance is achieved when the membrane is as thin as possible having a uniform pore size. Here in this thesis, membranes were synthesized by particle assisted wetting using mono-layers of silica colloids as templates for pores along with polymerizable organic liquids on water surface. The pore size reflects the original shape of the particles. Thus it is possible to tune the pore size by varying the particle size. This method is effective to control pore sizes of membranes by choosing silica particles of suitable size. This approach gives a porous structure that is very thin, but unfortunately limited in mechanical stability. Thus {{there is a need for}} support which is robust and can withstand the various mechanical stresses. A small change in the membrane or defect in the layered structure during the membrane formation can have drastic effect on the assembly. Lateral homogeneity of the layer generated by the particle assisted wetting can be judged by examination of its reflectivity, but once it is transferred on any solid support this option is no more. So a method is needed to detect the cracks or the inhomogenity of the membrane which can be detected even after the transfer. To tackle this problem a very simple and novel technique for characterizing the membrane by fluorescence labeling and optical inspection was developed in this thesis. The idea was to add a fluorescent dye which is poorly water soluble to the spreading solution comprising of the particles and the monomer. If the dye survived the photo-cross linking, then it would be embedded in the cross-linked polymer and would serve as a <b>marker.</b> <b>Defects</b> and inhomogenity would show up as cracks and spots. By the method that we have developed, we can detect our membrane from the support and spot defects...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} congenital {{defects in}} pigs; umbilical and scrotal hernia, cryptorchidism, kyphosis, splay legs, anal atresia, intersexuality and congenital tremor. The {{aim was to}} describe and estimate the prevalence of these defects and estimate the heritability for the most frequent defects, scrotal hernia and cryptorchidism in purebred Swedish Hampshire, Landrace and Yorkshire populations. Furthermore, information and opinions from herdsmen in commercial herds was collected and analysed. A low proportion of congenital defect pigs is of importance both from animal welfare and economic point of view. The accuracy of registration {{of the presence of}} defects in the litters has a decisive role for the ability to select against these defects. Linked with that is also the question to what degree these defects have a hereditary background. During summer and autumn 2008, data from Nordic Genetics’ database of recorded defects for purebred litters born in the period January 2000 to October 2007 was analysed. Data from 15 purebred herds, 5 from each breed, with at least 400 purebred litters, with in total 19 308 litters were included in the analysis. Two statistical models were applied to the data. One included fixed effects of breed, herd, season and parity number and the other was expanded with the effect of litter size. The effect of the boars on the prevalence of scrotal hernia and cryptorchidism, as fathers or maternal grandfathers of the litters, was analysed. The results show a variation of mean prevalence of congenital defects in purebred litters. The mean prevalence of any defect in litters was 7. 0 % in Hampshire, 12. 0 % in Landrace and 16. 8 % in Yorkshire. Cryptorchidism was the most common defect in Hampshire (4. 3 %) and Yorkshire (8. 3 %), and in Landrace (6. 5 %) scrotal hernia was most common. Significant effects of breed and herd and significant interactions between breed and year was found for scrotal hernia and cryptorchidism. Prevalence of scrotal hernia and cryptorchidism varied with parity number and month of birth. Prevalence increased with increasing litter size. For Landrace and Yorkshire boars, positive correlations were found between the prevalence of cryptorchidism in the litters when the boar was used as father and maternal grandfather, 0. 4 for Landrace and 0. 3 for Yorkshire. For Yorkshire there were positive correlations also for scrotal hernia, 0. 3. Estimated heritabilities were generally low (< 0. 1). 17 commercial herds with known high level of skill were visited and the herdsmen were interviewed during August and September 2008. The data were summarized and estimations of prevalence of defects among live born piglets were done. The commercial herds did all report that they see most of the defect piglets during farrowing, at teeth grinding and castration. Umbilical hernias and pigs with kyphosis were found later in life. Most common defect was splay legs, with a prevalence of 4 % of all piglets born alive. Umbilical hernia was found in about 2 % of all growers. Umbilical hernias were pointed out to be a troublesome defect due to decreased growth, problems to deliver pigs with the defect and reduced animal welfare. An increase of umbilical hernias had been seen during the last two years. Defects in the umbilical region are complex and need to be investigated more. In Norway defects have been included as health traits in the breeding program for Norwegian Landrace and Duroc. The large variation of prevalence of defects in the analysed Swedish purebred herds, within breeds, indicate a variation in accuracy of recording the defects. If more herds did record the prevalence of defects, the most important defects could be included in the breeding program. For the future, {{it might be possible to}} select against <b>defects</b> using genetic <b>markers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The modern {{prenatal}} diagnostics {{makes the}} detection possible for fetal malformations and chromosome aberrations already {{early in the}} pregnancy. The most importance is the ultrasound diagnostics, its quality into the years 90 he was improved increasingly. Through this it got being possible to detect malformations but also numerous smaller on-due dates, so-called soft markers, possibly, not only serious. A number of these ultrasonographically detectable markers is associated by unbalanced chromosome changes of the affected fetus so that the improved ultrasound diagnostics was {{the reason that the}} number of the invasive prenatal operations increased to the further clarification. In these study 3065 prenatal examinations were evaluated to chorionic villus sampling in the period of January 1990 until June 1997. The examinations were looked at under the question after indications and results of chromosomal examination. It showed itself a clear increase in the complete case numbers {{in the course of the}} time interval looked at in which the ultrasound indications were of growing significance. This trend can be explained to the prenatal diagnostics besides the improvement on the quality of the ultrasound presentations also with the safety of the invasive techniques. With an rate of aneuploidy of 27 % the increased nuchal translucency thickness showed itself as an important non-specific marker for chromosome aberrations. Primarily the Trisomie 21 made a great contribution to the pathological results. The isolated appearance also provided an important reference to chromosomal abnormalities. Pathological chromosomal findings were just as frequently found at the intrauterine growth retardation. The share of chromosomal abnormalities amounted to the 48 cases with growth retardation of our study at 27 %. Despite outweighing the cases with additional sonographic malformations an isolated result also could be recorded with pathological chromosomal finding. Very different chromosome aberrations were associated so that the meaning of the intrauterine growth retardation as a non-specific marker could be underlined. The association described in the literature between the cystic hygroma colli and the Turner syndrome could not be confirmed by our results absolutely. An explanation can be the concept intermixing of the ultrasound indications neck oedema/neck fold/neck transparency which there still was during the examination time period and hygroma colli. In a complete collective of 98 cases with a hygroma colli we found 5 cases with 45, X 0 constellation diagnoses, the number of the Trisomie 21 cases, however, was considerably about this. The Trisomie 18 was also more frequent than the Turner syndrome with a number of 6. An isolated appearance already played an important role in the detection of pathological chromosome results like the neck oedema. Of the markers which have to be classified as a soft marker the single umbilical artery as an ultrasonographically detectable marker into combination with further changes provided an important reference to chromosomal abnormalities. So 3 pathological chromosomal results in our collective of 34 cases with single umbilical artery, in connection with further malformations, could be diagnosed. The significance of the plexus choroideus cyst as a marker for Trisomie 18 could be stressed. Among 22 cases with this change 3 pathological cases of which 2 were a Trisomie 18 were found. There existed all pathological results, however, in combination with other malformations. An isolated plexus cyst plays a subordinate role in detection of chromosomal <b>defects.</b> The ultrasonographically <b>marker</b> sandal gaps is associated with the Down syndrom. We found one chromosome anomaly (Trisomie 21) among 9 cases with sandal gap. Further ultrasonographically changes were described. Despite the low case number it does not astonish that the only pathological results support an association between sandal gap and Trisomie 21. A real boom experienced the ultrasound indication "white spot" since the description of a association to the Trisomie 21 in the year 1995 th. 29 cases with this indication found in our collective. 2 pathological results of which one was a Trisomie 21 arose. With the achieved results of the study the significance of the selected ultrasound indications for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities could be shown. Particularly the neck oedema and the intrauterine growth retardation as most important non-specific markers are so confirmed. The so-called soft markers plexus cyst, white spot, single umbilical artery and sandal gap must arrange for the medical examiner DEGUM step II or III centre or an institution quality standard like carry out detailed malformation exclusion of other body regions or organs or refer to this...|$|R
