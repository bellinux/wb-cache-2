40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{producers}} of <b>explosives</b> in the world. The production of <b>explosives</b> is driven by the mines’ need for <b>explosives</b> to produce the commodities needed by the economy. South Africa used to offer a diploma in <b>explosives</b> technology, but this qualification was discontinued in 1996. Currently some qualifications in <b>explosives</b> management are being presented, but these qualifications do not fulfil the industry's need for technical education in <b>explosives.</b> The South African <b>explosives</b> industry reports that they need technical education in <b>explosives.</b> Because the <b>explosives</b> industry is relatively small in terms of personnel numbers, tertiary educational institutions are hesitant to establish a degree in <b>explosives</b> engineering or a similar qualification. The aim of the research conducted was to try and quantify this need as well as to give guidance to the structure of the <b>explosives</b> engineering qualifications. During the study representatives from all the role-players in the industry were interviewed. Further information was gathered by means of a questionnaire. This data were combined and analysed and it was found that there is a definite need for a diploma in <b>explosives</b> engineering, an undergraduate degree in <b>explosives</b> engineering as well as post graduate qualifications in this discipline. The research has shown that there is a good possibility that these qualifications would be sustainable considering the growth in the South African <b>explosives</b> industry, as well as the growth in the African mining market.

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an <b>explosive</b> charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the <b>explosive</b> charge. As any <b>explosive</b> charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
