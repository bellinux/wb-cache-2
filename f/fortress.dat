5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the <b>fortress</b> by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the <b>fortress,</b> making it appear more of a fortified house than a <b>fortress.</b> The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the <b>fortress</b> was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their <b>fortress</b> on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.|$|E
5|$|Deva Victrix, {{or simply}} Deva, was a legionary <b>fortress</b> and {{town in the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia {{on the site of}} the modern city of Chester. The <b>fortress</b> was built by the Legio II Adiutrix in the AD 70s as the Roman army advanced north against the Brigantes, and rebuilt completely over the next few decades by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix. In the early 3rd century the <b>fortress</b> was again rebuilt. The legion probably remained at the <b>fortress</b> until the late 4th or early 5th century, upon which it fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications {{and other}} {{structures}} {{were built in}} the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large <b>fortress</b> and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader <b>fortress</b> {{with the addition of a}} mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large <b>fortress</b> with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader <b>fortress</b> in Saffuriya.|$|E

50|$|Cooperative {{research}} and discussions {{between the two}} countries, {{over the issue of}} determining the origins of these <b>fortresses</b> began in the 1970s. <b>Fortresses</b> of roughly the same type are extant in Korea, but only because they have been repaired or restored, either during the Joseon period or in the 20th century, and thus arguments of their similarity to the Japanese <b>fortresses</b> in question are difficult to prove. On the other hand, enough of the ruins do remain that most scholars believe it obvious that these <b>fortresses</b> in question have far more in common with one another than with other Japanese <b>fortresses,</b> particularly later ones.|$|R
5|$|From 1513, Petar Kružić {{was one of}} the {{commanding}} officers of Klis <b>Fortress.</b> The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis <b>Fortress</b> on several occasions. The first major attempt was by Skender-beg Ornosović in 1515. The Ottomans captured Klis, a village just below the <b>fortress</b> bearing the same name, but the garrison in the <b>fortress</b> above held. Kružić was promoted to captain of the Klis <b>Fortress</b> by the ban Petar Berislavić in 1520. The second major attempt was in 1520, and a year later another attempt was made by Makut-paša, with additional 2,000 infantry, 50 horsemen and siege equipment. Another unsuccessful attempt was made in 1522, by Hasan-paša from Mostar and Mehmed-beg Mihalbegović. Later that year, Mihalbegović made another attempt at a siege with 3,000 men, but failed again. During 1523, Klis <b>Fortress</b> was again under attack by the Sultan's army. Attempts were also made by Gazi Husrev-beg in 1526 and 1528, and later in 1531 and 1532.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Ottomans under Mihalbegović laid a months-long siege with a {{constant}} concentrated cannonade to the <b>fortress.</b> Ferdinand urged the Pope to send ships {{to relieve the}} Ottoman siege. Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege, Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no assistance {{in the defense of}} the <b>fortress.</b> In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the <b>fortress</b> by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of the <b>fortress.</b>|$|E
5|$|In about 50CE, a Roman vexillatio built a large timber <b>fortress</b> on {{a hilltop}} (near {{the site of}} the current church) at Letocetum. This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of {{governor}} Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes. It was a good defensive position, but the poor farmland surrounding the <b>fortress</b> could not support large numbers of soldiers. During the Neronian period this initial <b>fortress</b> was replaced with a smaller one and Letocetum then developed into a large-scale posting station. Most of the troops moved to the <b>fortress</b> at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58CE.|$|E

The <b>fortresses</b> are also surrounded by a protective wall made of blocks, which take several shots to destroy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fortresses</b> were {{constructed}} at Ta-ning, Fu-yü, Hui-chou, and K'aun-ho (near the Great Wall) and completed {{at the end}} of the summer of 1387. In Ta-ning, a regional military commission was established to command the four <b>fortresses.</b> Prince Zhu Quan (Prince of Ning) would later be stationed at Ta-ning and take command of the four <b>fortresses.</b> Millions of piculs of foodstuff were stored at the four <b>fortresses.</b> Beiping, Shangdong, Shanxi, and Henan provinces dispatched the peasantry to transport grain to the north.|$|R
50|$|The wars {{against the}} Ottoman Empire {{also led to}} great {{developments}} {{in the construction of}} Hungarian <b>fortresses.</b> Earlier <b>fortresses</b> had been built before the era of heavy artillery, but were now fortified to resist it. The best-known surviving <b>fortresses</b> from this period are those of Eger, Nagyvárad, Nagykanizsa and Érsekújvár (Nové Zámky in Slovakia).|$|R
5|$|Klis <b>Fortress</b> is {{probably}} {{best known for its}} defense against the Ottoman invasion of Europe in the early 16th century. Croatian captain Petar Kružić led the defense of the <b>fortress</b> against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, as Kružić and his soldiers fought without allies against the Turks, the military faction of Uskoks was formed, which later became famous as an elite Croatian militant sect. Ultimately, the defenders were defeated and the <b>fortress</b> was occupied by the Ottomans in 1537. After more than a century under Ottoman rule, in 1669, Klis <b>Fortress</b> was besieged and seized by the Republic of Venice, thus moving the border between Christian and Muslim Europe further east and helping to contribute to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians restored and enlarged the <b>fortress,</b> but it was taken by the Austrians after Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. Today, Klis <b>Fortress</b> contains a museum where visitors to this historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the <b>fortress.</b> It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the <b>fortress.</b> Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the <b>fortress,</b> communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the <b>fortress</b> defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|Since Duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia made Klis <b>Fortress</b> {{the seat}} of his throne {{in the middle of the}} 9th century, the <b>fortress</b> served as {{the seat of}} many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, Duke Trpimir I, the founder of the Croatian royal House of Trpimirović, is {{significant}} for spreading Christianity in the Duchy of Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis <b>Fortress,</b> and in Rižinice, in the valley under the <b>fortress,</b> he built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, Tomislav, Klis and Biograd na Moru were his chief residences.|$|E
50|$|During these years, the old <b>fortresses</b> at Belgrade, Osijek, Karlovac and Slavonski Brod {{which were}} built in the 17th century were razed because they had lost their {{military}} significance. The engineer Colonel Dragoš Đelošević, who was responsible for the destruction of the <b>fortresses,</b> regarded Petrovaradin far too beautiful to suffer the fate of the other <b>fortresses</b> and spared it.|$|R

5|$|The <b>fortress</b> {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely {{discernible}} from the distance as a man-made structure. The defensive capabilities of the <b>fortress</b> have been tested through history in many military operations. During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, {{to keep up with}} the development of arms. The original appearance of the <b>fortress</b> is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone <b>fortress</b> dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fortress</b> was {{the best}} {{developed}} citadel during the 14th century.

At the foot of the <b>fortress,</b> monasteries and churches were found; some of which were reconstructed in the 1980s. The restoration works completed in 2015 covered walls of the <b>fortress,</b> creating tracks for walking around the <b>fortress,</b> and also building turnstiles. Other infrastructure created to encourage tourism are artistic lighting and equipment for temperature and humidity control, publicity brochures and overall management aspects.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later, the current <b>fortress</b> was built {{close to the}} desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's {{descendants}} held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the <b>fortress</b> was continuously restored and strengthened {{as a result of}} frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk <b>fortress</b> along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's postal route. It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the <b>fortress</b> primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981.|$|E

In former days these <b>fortresses</b> were identified with the domination of power, economic exploitation and as symbols of foreign rule in areas ruled by local kings and entrepeneurs. Due to political and economic changes as well as in town planning, the funtion of these <b>fortresses</b> also changed. At present, the <b>fortresses</b> function as heritage sites and interesting places to be visited by tourists.

5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac <b>Fortress,</b> it is both large and well-preserved.

It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the <b>fortress</b> is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities.
