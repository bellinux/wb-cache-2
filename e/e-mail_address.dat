5|$|Some {{aircraft}} in the CAP fleet are equipped with the SDIS. This system allows CAP to send back real-time images of a disaster or crash site to anyone with an <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> allowing the mission coordinators to make more informed decisions. There are approximately 100 federally funded SDIS systems strategically located across the United States, with more than 20 additional systems funded by state and local governments.|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, a few outsiders attend Michael's party. One of the {{attendees}} (Tate Hanyok) strikes {{up a conversation}} with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), who tries to sell her paper; Dwight becomes angry when she tells him she already has a paper supplier. Another attendee named Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt) converses with Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), who is still somewhat depressed over his breakup with his fiancée Stacy and walks away when he admits it was she who broke it off. Kevin returns later to apologize to Lynne and admits he gets nervous talking to pretty girls; Lynne is flattered and gives Kevin her <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay and later encourage Michael to leave with them.|$|E
5|$|Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E
50|$|In e-mail {{programs}} autocomplete {{is typically}} used {{to fill in}} the <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of the intended recipients. Generally, there are a small number of frequently used <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> hence it is relatively easy to use autocomplete to select among them. Like web <b>addresses,</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> are often long, hence typing them completely is inconvenient.|$|R
50|$|E-mail spambots harvest <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> from {{material}} {{found on}} the Internet {{in order to build}} mailing lists for sending unsolicited e-mail, also known as spam. Such spambots are web crawlers that can gather <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> from websites, newsgroups, special-interest group (SIG) postings, and chat-room conversations. Because <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> have a distinctive format, such spambots are easy to code.|$|R
50|$|A {{directory}} harvest attack (DHA) is {{a technique}} used by spammers {{in an attempt to}} find valid/existent <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain by using brute force. The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> are found by brute force guessing valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain).|$|R
5|$|In July 2011, a {{high-quality}} {{recording of the}} Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, {{the vice president of}} Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video, including the IP address, <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.|$|E

25|$|The law {{contains}} other dubious provisions— for example, {{the creation}} of a nationwide public electronic register of e-mail addresses that do not want to receive spam. It is usually abused as the perfect source for <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> harvesting, because publishing invalid or incorrect information in such a register is a criminal offense in Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|Another type of spamware is {{software}} used {{to search}} for <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> to build lists of <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> to be used either for spamming directly or {{to be sold to}} spammers.|$|R
5000|$|The above {{statement}} would {{list all}} <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> {{for each person}} whose last name starts with [...] "Van". A single entry would be output for each person, with multiple lines showing the multiple <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> (without repeating other data about the person).|$|R
5000|$|Once executed, {{the worm}} {{replicates}} by sending copies of itself to other <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> {{found on the}} host's machine, and installs a keystroke logger, which then captures everything typed on the affected computer. Badtrans then transmits the data to one of several <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Meyer {{finished}} {{an outline}} of the book in 2003, but developed and changed it as she wrote New Moon and Eclipse, though the main and most significant storylines remained unchanged. Little, Brown and Company took certain measures to prevent the book's contents from leaking, such as closing forums and message boards on several fansites and providing a special <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> for fans to send in links to leaks and spoilers online.|$|E
25|$|Votes {{were cast}} online {{and at the}} 30 MLB ballparks. Monster was the sponsor of the online portion of balloting. There was a limit of 25 votes per <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> but no limit {{to the number of}} ballots cast at the stadium. The {{deadline}} to cast votes was July 2. Rosters were announced on July 6. Alex Rodriguez led all players in votes for the second consecutive year with 3,934,518 votes, while Chase Utley led all National League players with 3,889,602 votes.|$|E
25|$|PGPencryption uses {{a serial}} {{combination}} of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses {{one of several}} supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a user name or an <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system, which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to PGP implementations later. Current versions of PGP encryption include both options through an automated key management server.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the Penet remailer used {{a type of}} “post office box” {{system in}} which users could claim their own {{anonymous}} <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of the form anxxxxx@anon.penet.fi, allowing them to assign pseudonymous identities to their anonymous messages, and to receive messages sent to their (anonymous) <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R

25|$|Adams used email to {{correspond}} with Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> and began posting to his own USENET newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams {{to set up a}} message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived on Channel 9.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how available <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> {{can be incorporated}} into mixed-mode procedures for surveys of the public, especially client groups. Cooperative Extension Service clients provide the basis for analyzing how implementation procedures affect response rates and substantive findings. These clients form three strata based on contact information provided: postal <b>address</b> only, <b>e-mail</b> only, and both. From clients who provided mail and <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> four experimental groups were created, including two mixed-mode groups, a mail-only group and an e-mail-only group. Using mail and <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> to implement a sequence of e-mail and postal invitations in a mixed-mode design resulted in response rates that are equivalent to those for mail-only surveys. Also, clients who provided a postal address only differed on some attributes from those in the other strata. This study demonstrates the benefit of obtaining <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> and using them in mixed-mode surveys...|$|R
40|$|Spam {{has become}} one of the most {{annoying}} and costly phenomenon in the Internet. Valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> belong to the most valuable resources of spammers, but little is known about spammers’ behavior when collecting and harvesting addresses and spammers’ capabilities and interest in carefully directed, consumer-oriented marketing have not been explored yet. Gaining insight into spammers’ ways to obtain and (mis) use <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> is useful in many ways, e. g. for the assessment of the effectiveness of address obscuring techniques and the usability and necessity of hiding <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> on the Internet. This paper presents a spam honeypot project in progress addressing these issues by systematically placing <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> in the Internet and analyzing received e-mails. The honeypot’s conceptual framework, its implementation, and first empirical results are presented. Finally, an outlook on further work and activities is provided...|$|R

25|$|The vehicle {{identification}} number (VIN) plate, a unique serial number used to identify individual motor vehicles, {{had been removed from}} the car's dashboard and the door VIN sticker, but police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block. The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E
