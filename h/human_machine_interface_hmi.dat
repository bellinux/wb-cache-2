50|$|There {{are many}} types of MOM software, {{including}} for production management, performance analysis, quality and compliance, and <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>HMI).</b> Production management software provides real-time information about jobs and orders, labor and materials, machine status, and product shipments. Performance analysis software displays metrics at the machine, line, plant and enterprise level for situational or historical analysis.

5000|$|A complex {{automated}} industrial system [...] - [...] such as {{manufacturing assembly}} line [...] - [...] usually needs a distributed control system—an organized hierarchy of controller systems—to function. In this hierarchy, {{there is usually}} a <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (<b>HMI)</b> at the top, where an operator can monitor or operate the system. This is typically linked to a middle layer of programmable logic controllers (PLC) via a non-time-critical communications system (e.g. Ethernet). At {{the bottom of the}} control chain is the fieldbus that links the PLCs to the components that actually do the work, such as sensors, actuators, electric motors, console lights, switches, valves and contactors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (<b>HMIs)</b> are the {{communication}} devices between in-vehicle applications and the driver. Frequently, independent HMIs {{are used for}} different applications which may cause information overload situations at the driver. Hence, a common HMI design that determines the application <b>interface</b> with an <b>HMI</b> Manager that provides rules for prioritizing information from different applications is needed. The design takes into account: application transparency, driver situation awareness, driver workload and surrounding external influences. By reducing distraction, especially when the situation requires more attention of the driver, the need for controlling the information flow emerges.

50|$|Wonderware was co-founded by Dennis Morin and Phil Huber. Both were former {{employees}} of another local startup located in Irvine, California. Mr. Morin's founding vision was a Windows-based <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (<b>HMI)</b> that {{was inspired by}} an early 1980s video game that allowed players to digitally construct a pinball game. His idea was that operators monitoring factory operations would be more productive if they used a machine that was fun and easy to use. He was terminated from Triconex in February, 1986. In {{one of the great}} rags-to-riches entrepreneurial stories of the 1980s, Mr. Morin was 40 years old when he left Triconex. Up until then, the college dropout had either been fired or never been promoted from every job he managed to find. He drove a Taxi in Boston before coming to California, hitching a ride with some friends in the 1970s. He told his idea to a young technology wizard, Phil Huber, who was still employed by Triconex. Mr. Huber was a Penn State graduate who once worked at the legendary Bell labs before coming to California.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, one of {{the early}} {{implementations}} of mutual capacitance touchscreen technology was developed at CERN based on their capacitance touch screens developed in 1972 by Danish electronics engineer Bent Stumpe. This technology was used to develop a new type of <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>HMI)</b> for the control room of the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator. In a handwritten note dated 11 March 1972, Stumpe presented his proposed solution - a capacitive touch screen with a fixed number of programmable buttons presented on a display. The screen was to consist of a set of capacitors etched into a film of copper on a sheet of glass, each capacitor being constructed so that a nearby flat conductor, such as the surface of a finger, would increase the capacitance by a significant amount. The capacitors were to consist of fine lines etched in copper on a sheet of glass - fine enough (80 μm) and sufficiently far apart (80 μm) to be invisible (CERN Courier April 1974 p117). In the final device, a simple lacquer coating prevented the fingers from actually touching the capacitors. In 1976, MIT described a keyboard with variable graphics capable of multi-touch detection, for what is very likely to be the very first multitouch screen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In-vehicle {{infotainment}} applications {{often have}} to contend with different degrees of unpredictability. These applications can benefit if they can specify quality requirements to the service they access. This paper presents our attempt to apply Model Driven Architecture (MDA) technology to integrate the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for In-vehicle <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (<b>HMI)</b> clients of infotainment applications. QoS subsystem of Human Machine Interface framework provides the essential QoS modelling support to specify QoS related requirements. QoS modelling constructs and components of the Infotainment Human Machine Interface Framework (iHMIFw) support construction of platform independent model of infotainment HMI applications with required QoS specifications. A model transformation has been described that is supported by the framework and results into XML description of QoS specifications.

40|$|The {{process of}} Combat Identification (CID) demands that {{objects in the}} battlespace be quickly and {{accurately}} characterized to maximize combat effectiveness, {{and to protect the}} lives of friendly forces and non-combatants. Because stressful situations can inhibit cognitive abilities, <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interfaces</b> (<b>HMIs)</b> designed for combat use must be built to optimize the display of relevant information. Psychophysical responses of the human visual system known as preattentive processing may hold some of the keys to building systems that quickly and accurately convey battlespace information to war fighters. Background information and research is presented regarding preattentive processing and preattentive attributes, supporting its use in HMI design. Practical examples showing HMI applications of preattentive attributes are illustrated, and relevant design implications discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interfaces</b> (<b>HMI)</b> in {{the product}} {{division}} of air traffic management (ATM) are in use for long time spans. For an efficient use of HMIs not only user centered but also migration tolerant designs are important. Migration tolerance therefore means considering future requirements for a long lasting controller HMI life cycle. For efficient ATM, the concept of system wide information management (SWIM) will be introduced. This generates {{a large amount of}} additional information that will influence controller work. In this paper, we therefore describe a new controller role called Information-and-Conflict-Manager (ICM) who handles the complexity induced by SWIM. The resulting HMI design draft demonstrates how the integration of data could be managed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} process of automotive <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interfaces</b> (<b>HMIs)</b> is traditionally {{characterized by a}} number of discontinuities. A diverse set of stake-holders participate in this {{development process}}, all of which have their own perspectives, use their own approaches, and rely on their own representational frameworks and tools. Our strategy to overcome the existing discontinuities relies on a model-based approach: our goal is to use a formal HMI specification that serves as a common basis for all phases of the development process, including automated testing. Currently, our automated tests compare the HMI embedded control unit (ECU) against a prototype that has been derived partially from a formal specification. We are working toward being able to derive the prototype almost completely automatically from the specification and test the HMI ECU automatically against the formal specification. ...|$|R
