Natural compounds from plants can {{play an important role in}} the development of novel antibiotics and, therefore, new treatments for infectious diseases. Eucalypt trees exude a polyphenol- and tannin-rich <b>gum</b> (<b>kino)</b> that has been used medicinally in Australia for thousands of years for curing ailments such as bowel inflammation, diarrhoea, sores, skin lesions, scabies, cramps, sore throat and cough. However, kino has not been analysed to identify compounds responsible for biological activity. We screened extracts of kino from three eucalypts against six microorganisms: three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus); and a unicellular fungus (Candida albicans). We identified one eucalypt species with kino that had high antimicrobial activity and found that its extracts had particularly high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We isolated and purified nine compounds from the kino of this species, and found that some compounds were active against 14 non-replicate strains of P. aeruginosa obtained from Queensland hospitals. Active compounds were not cytotoxic to Caco- 2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells. Our results demonstrate the benefits of using an ethnobotanically guided approach to screen natural compounds for use as antimicrobial agents. The importance of these findings for potential antimicrobial functionality in this plant will be discussed...|$|E
5000|$|Leucodelphinidin is a colorless {{chemical}} compound related to leucoanthocyanidins. It {{can be found}} in Acacia auriculiformis, in the bark of Karada (Cleistanthus collinus) and in the <b>kino</b> (<b>gum)</b> from Eucalyptus pilularis.|$|R
50|$|Kinotannic acid is {{the chief}} {{constituent}} of the <b>kino</b> <b>gum,</b> of which it contains 70 to 80 per cent. Kino also contains kino red, a phlobaphene produced from kinotannic acid by oxidation. It {{is closely related to}} the tannin from catechu; its non-glucosidal nature was established by Bergholz.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} and {{environmental}} adaptability of Eucalyptus species has favored their global cultivation for pulpwood production. On {{the island of}} Sardinia, Italy, eucalypt plantations were established in the 20 th century primarily in areas reclaimed from marshland, but the trees are now grown all over the island as ornamentals or windbreaks, and for timber, pulp and honey production. In recent years, an unusual decline and mortality of unknown etiology has been observed in Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum) plantations throughout the island. Given the ecological and economic importance of eucalypt ecosystems in Sardinia, a survey {{was carried out in}} 2013 to determine which insect pests and fungal pathogens are directly involved in these phenomena. Field surveys throughout the island revealed severe infestations with the red gum lerp psyllid (Glycaspis brimblecombei) at all 12 surveyed sites, with the greatest numbers of pre-imaginal stages and adults occurring between May and July. The adult population reached its peak in July, followed 2 months later by the peak population of its specific parasitoid, Psyllaephagus bliteus. Symptoms of leaf chlorosis, crown thinning, shoot and branch dieback, sunken cankers, epicormic shoots and exudations of <b>kino</b> <b>gum</b> were also observed at the 12 field sites. Symptomatic woody samples yielded fungal isolates representing three distinct families: Botryosphaeriaceae, Diaporthaceae and Valsaceae. Morphological and DNA sequence data revealed seven distinct fungal species, namely Diaporthe foeniculina, Neofusicoccum australe, N. luteum, N. mediterraneum, N. parvum, N. vitifusiforme and Valsa fabianae. Two putative new species of Cytospora were also identified. Neofusicoccum australe was the only species recovered from all 12 sites, with isolation frequencies of 51 - 95 %. Pathogenicity trials revealed that all Neofusicoccum species except N. vitifusiforme are directly involved in the etiology of the observed decline in the E. camaldulensis population on Sardinia...|$|R
