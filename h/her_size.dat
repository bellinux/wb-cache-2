5|$|As Melbourne was {{the only}} ship of <b>her</b> <b>size</b> (both in {{dimensions}} and ship's company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board {{for more than two}} years. The majority of Melbournes commanders later reached flag rank. The carrier was also called on to perform underway replenishments and command and control functions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the last}} minute, Thumbelina escapes the {{situation}} by fleeing to a far land with a swallow she nursed back to health during the winter. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just <b>her</b> <b>size</b> and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain <b>her</b> <b>size</b> to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
60|$|She was delighted. She {{clapped her}} hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And {{the way he had}} looked around, {{studying}} <b>her,</b> <b>sizing</b> <b>her</b> up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.|$|R
50|$|In early 2006, Atkinson {{underwent}} breast enlargement surgery, {{which took}} <b>her</b> bra <b>size</b> to a 34E. She {{said in an}} interview that she lost weight due to a fitness regimen and <b>her</b> bust <b>size</b> declined and that the surgery then gave them the original size and shape they once had.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women's Championship. Nakano used <b>her</b> <b>size</b> {{to perform}} such moves as leg drops and several submission holds. Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick. Vachon got involved by choking Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee. The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop, allowing Blayze to pin {{her for the}} win.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. <b>Her</b> <b>size</b> {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of <b>her</b> <b>size,</b> speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
50|$|In early 2014, Dillon {{had breast}} {{augmentation}} surgery to increase <b>her</b> breast <b>size</b> to a 34DD.|$|R
25|$|Soon after {{deciding}} {{to focus on}} modelling, Beauchamp began a fitness regime {{in order to stay}} in shape. When this caused her breasts to sag, she made the decision to undergo breast augmentation surgery, increasing <b>her</b> cup <b>size</b> from a 32C to a 34D. After a year, finding the saline implants unsatisfactory, she underwent surgery a second time, getting slightly bigger silicone implants and increasing <b>her</b> cup <b>size</b> to 32DD. In 2009, Beauchamp went for an additional breast surgery, this time increasing the silicone implants to 800cc and <b>her</b> cup <b>size</b> 32FF. She dismisses criticism about the implants, deeming it hypocritical to applaud people for improving their intellects while condemning them for improving their bodies.|$|R
50|$|Rachel Howard is Professor Howard's daughter, who {{fights with}} tonfa batons. <b>Her</b> small <b>size</b> allows <b>her</b> {{to get in}} tight places.|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} story, Delphi has {{transformed}} {{herself into a}} Kabuto-like creature to challenge the original. The player wanders around the islands as the Delphi-Kabuto character, searching for prey to increase <b>her</b> <b>size.</b> After Delphi-Kabuto achieves her maximum size, she proceeds to a boss fight with the original Kabuto. Despite her victory, Kabuto revives in a triggered cut scene and restores her Reaper form; whereupon the player takes the role of Baz against the revived monster. After defeating Kabuto, Baz {{is shown in the}} final cut scene, flying off to Planet Majorca with Delphi, Borjoyzee, and his fellow Meccaryns.|$|E
5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing <b>her</b> <b>size</b> several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty Board also {{considered}} Brilliant too lightly armed for <b>her</b> <b>size.</b> She measured an additional 50 tons burthen over a standard 32-gun frigate but carried only four more cannon. For these reasons, Brilliant {{was the last}} vessel {{to be built in}} the Venus-class. Subsequent generations of Royal Navy frigates preserved elements of her design, but with an extended hull to allow for additional gun ports and the carrying of larger weapons including the 18-pounder long gun.|$|E
50|$|A Freshman {{girl who}} {{falls in love}} at first sight with her senior Miki. She is very strong, despite <b>her</b> small <b>size.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Matanuska {{is similar}} to its sister ship, the Malaspina, but larger than Taku which was never {{stretched}} beyond <b>her</b> original <b>size.</b>|$|R
50|$|In November 2010, Renn {{said she}} had lost weight through hiking and yoga, and that <b>her</b> dress <b>size</b> dropped to a US 8.|$|R
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that made her a potential NECPA platform. <b>Her</b> <b>size</b> allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases <b>her</b> <b>size</b> substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It opens {{at the start of}} the rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in <b>her</b> <b>size.</b> With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E

25|$|Captain Thomas Mullion {{acquired}} {{a letter of}} marque on 10 May 1798. Because of <b>her</b> <b>size,</b> Kingsmill was rated as having a legal capacity of 560, or 850 slaves.|$|E
25|$|The same year, <b>her</b> <b>size</b> and the {{observed}} similarity of her swing {{to that of}} Els, led some in the sports media to call her The Big Wiesy, a play on Els' nickname of The Big Easy.|$|E
25|$|Jenny is a Masai giraffe. Jenny is {{the wisest}} of the animals. She helps Willa during her adventures and {{acts as a}} mother figure to Willa since Willa's mother is not around. Due to <b>her</b> <b>size,</b> Jenny sleeps outside.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{appeared}} as the cover girl on Playboy magazine's October 1989 issue. She moved to Los Angeles to further pursue a modeling career. Playboy subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, {{in which she}} appeared in the centerfold photo. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery, increasing <b>her</b> bust <b>size</b> to 34D. She increased <b>her</b> bust <b>size</b> again, to 34DD, several years later. Anderson has since appeared in Playboy {{several times in the}} 1990s and the 2000s.|$|R

25|$|The {{international}} {{oil market}} however, did not improve; <b>her</b> <b>size</b> also placed restrictions on {{where she could}} be employed, and this must have led to her early demise. Active service ended when Bellamya was laid up at Vestnes, Norway, on January 26, 1984, and she arrived at Ulsan, South Korea on January 6, 1986 to be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Sunny South {{was built}} for the China trade, {{but she was too}} small to be {{profitable}} on that route. The timbers of her wooden hull were somewhat lighter than usual for a ship of <b>her</b> <b>size,</b> and diagonally strapped with iron. Sunny Souths topsides were black, and a scaly sea serpent was her figurehead.|$|E
25|$|Enterprise was the {{smallest}} J-Class to be built, <b>her</b> <b>size</b> being an early {{indication of the}} ruthless efficiency that was employed by the renowned naval architect Starling Burgess. The efficiency of design was coupled {{to a number of}} pioneering features such as the Park Avenue Boom, hidden lightweight winches and the world’s first duralumin mast.|$|E
50|$|Among her {{recordings}} was a boxed set of Beethoven's {{complete works}} for solo piano and orchestra, including two early works without opus number, {{as well as}} Beethoven's own arrangement for piano of his violin concerto. It is, however, her Chopin playing for which she will be most remembered. A pianist of considerable power, despite <b>her</b> diminutive <b>size,</b> <b>her</b> recordings of the Chopin mazurkas, in particular, are considered landmark interpretations.|$|R
