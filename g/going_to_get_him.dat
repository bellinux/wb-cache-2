The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that [...] "I want my man and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> whatever". Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the top. He felt that [...] "Can't Stop", at 4:45 length, was {{a good example of the}} division of Madonna's songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book , described Faure's song [...] "24 Hours" [...] as a slow track which fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson's [...] "Turn it Up" [...] as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.|$|E

Hearing rumors that colleagues were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> expelled from the College of Physicians, Rush resigned and formed a new medical society, which many of the city's younger doctors joined. Rush's promotion of his remedies and attacks on others was strongly criticized by the medical community.|$|R

50|$|Sōra is {{a little}} girl that is rarely seen without Justice. She is the {{youngest}} main character by far, as Justice, Tsuyuri, and Najimi are all in college and Sōra {{is the only one}} apparently too young to participate in Justice's dōjinshi browsing. Her relationship with Justice is often portrayed as somewhat inappropriate, and it has been stated that Justice makes all the cute outfits Sōra wears. Sōra also gave Justice her first kiss, which he suddenly realizes is his first kiss as well. Sōra has stated many times that she loves Justice, and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She wants to set up Najimi with Junichirō so Najimi will not be in the way of Justice and Sōra's relationship.|$|R

60|$|The truth is, I {{have got}} my hero (or heroine) {{into such a}} {{particularly}} close place that I do not see how I am ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> (or her) out of it again, and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole business, and leave that person {{to get out the}} best way that offers---or else stay there.

Tell him that he is not to go nearer than ten yards to the cabin, that we've got him covered, and if he makes any break it will be his last one." ...|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in Victory Lane after his victory lap {{to celebrate his}} fifth win {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; the win earned him $191,886. He was pleased with the result, saying he was happy to have taken the victory: [...] "We've been running up front the last three of four races and haven't been able to close the deal. Today we did." [...] Hamlin was disappointed with his finish as he felt he had a faster car after the race's final restart but admitted Johnson would not be beaten: [...] "It was my only shot <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around <b>him.</b> I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> under <b>him</b> completely. There was no way possible. I was doing the best I could to win the race." [...] He later admitted that he made contact with Johnson and that it was on purpose. Labonte said about his third-place finish, [...] "I feel like I stole something." [...] Jeff Burton was philosophical about his retirement from the race: [...] "These things happen. Everybody has had an issue in this Chase, and we had ours today. This thing is not over for us by any means." [...] Kenseth, who finished eleventh, was optimistic about his chances of winning the Drivers' Championship: [...] "It's great to be the leader, but we've got to start running good, It's still pretty wide open. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be pretty exciting, I think, coming down to the last race." ...|$|R
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw. He {{struggled}} {{at first}} with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles {{told him to}} lower his arm and {{become more of a}} sidearm pitcher. Now, as he pitches, he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup says that he is still a little inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the success that he's had." [...] One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes, stating that [...] "ou know exactly what you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from <b>him</b> every time he takes the mound and he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> add any excitement to any situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|The colonel smiled grimly.

I am as {{convinced}} as can be that it was he who fastened that baste of a bird in my shako the other day, and made me the laughing stock of the whole regiment on parade. Faith, I could not {{for the life of me}} make out what was the matter, there was a tugging and a jumping and a fluttering overhead, and I thought the shako was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fly away. It fairly gave me a scare, for I thought the shako had gone mad, and that the divil was in it. I have often overlooked his tricks for your sake, but when it comes to his commanding officer, it is too serious altogether." ...|$|R

[...] However, the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago ordered him returned to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to be present for a hearing on a related legal matter, and Zagel then approved Marcello's extended stay for his appeal. [...] With Marcello's appeals virtually exhausted, the federal government—without Zagel's permission—began transferring Marcello to Atwater in early February 2012. However, on February 9, 2012, Zagel angrily demanded that Marcello be brought back to Chicago to help his attorney with his pending appeal. [...] Arguments in Marcello's appeal were scheduled for February 13, 2012, and Zagel acknowledged the tight turnaround as he publicly excoriated {{the federal government for}} transferring Marcello out of Chicago without Zagel's permission. [...] "I don't even know how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> back," [...] Zagel said, referring to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Regarding the original plot, Park said:The original story was that Wallace and Gromit were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go to the Moon and there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be a whole lot}} of characters there. One of them was a parking meter attendant, which {{was the only one that}} remained - the robot cooker character - but there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be aliens, and all sorts. There was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a McDonald's on the Moon, and it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like a spoof Star Wars. Wallace was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> thrown into prison and Gromit was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> out. By the time I came to Aardman, I had just started doing the Moon scene and somebody told me, [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take you another nine years if you do that scene!"

Kessler tells her that David turned down the job and stopped working for them a month ago, and that David wanted a fresh start, leaving all of this behind him. He also mentions that he was a very sad, broken man and had a drinking problem. Meanwhile, David is being blasted with the Ray Sphere. She tells Kessler that she knows who he is and warns him she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> call the police.

'Nothing,' says she, 'but seeing him come home with his hair cut short and his whiskers shaved off, and finding that he could not give me any good reason for disfiguring himself in that way. I had my suspicions that something was wrong, and the sight of your advertisement strengthened them directly.' The hearing her say that suggested to my mind that there might be a difficulty in identifying him after the change in his looks, and I asked him what he had done with the loose hair before we left London. It was found in the pocket of his traveling coat just as he had huddled it up there on leaving the Hall, worry, and fright, and vexation, having caused him to forget all about it. Of course I took charge of the parcel, and you know what good it did as well as I do. So to speak, William, it just completed this beautifully neat case.
