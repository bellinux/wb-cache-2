40|$|AbstractThe European Union's {{enlargement}} process has {{entered a new}} phase. The completion of the accession negotiations with Croatia opened the way to membership in mid- 2013. In addition, for Turkey, accession process remains the most effective framework for promoting EU-related reforms, developing dialogue on foreign policy issues, strengthening economic competitiveness and diversifying supply of energy sources. Similarly, improved energy cooperation with the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> directly benefits European citizens and businesses. Energy interconnection {{is a key element}} in the EU's cooperation with all neighboring countries aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth, trade and cultural exchange, employment, as well as at improving living conditions. All <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> have now embarked upon a path of recovery, though at varying paces. For instance, Turkey has emerged from the crisis with a bigger economy and its growth continues to be impressive, but there are increasing signs of overheating. The Western Balkan economies are also beginning to recover, though it will take some time for them to reach pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, climate developments will affect financial positions through their direct impact on tax bases and spending programs, and more importantly, through the policies needed to mitigate climate change and adapt behaviors and production to the new environment. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between economic growth, energy intensity, and financial management and CO 2 emissions in case of the EU...|$|R
40|$|This Master's thesis {{focuses on}} European Union's {{accession}} conditionality in the Western Balkans countries {{in relation to}} their foreign policy alignment after the Ukrainian crisis and the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. More specifically, it analyses the alignment of current official and potential candidate states with sanctions on Russia. The alignment of <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> is necessary for both the candidate countries if they intend to become members {{as well as for the}} EU itself as the former need to fully adopt all acquis and the latter needs to preserve its capability to “speak in a single voice” and continue promoting its values abroad. The main aim of the thesis is to ascertain whether EU's conditionality is credible for current <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries.</b> As foreign policy alignment is part of non-negotiable criteria for accession, the extent of alignment and the reasons why these states have aligned or not aligned with sanctions on Russia is analysed. In doing so, the focus is on the normative basis of policy positions and the role of EU values in the statements of government representatives. The thesis firstly elaborates on the importance of enlargement, foreign policy alignment and norm transfer, and then moves on to analyse whether the EU puts pressure on candidate states to align, and how government officials publicly respond to this pressure. Secondly, the thesis moves on to analyse the substance of the explanations of Western Balkan government representatives and the possible variety of domestic actors who might be interested in promoting an alternative foreign policy agenda. Results show that most non-aligning Western Balkan states refuse to join sanctions due to their rational interests and/or close relations with Russia. Furthermore, there are also countries that already align, but have joined EU sanctions partly due to their own self-interest. All in all, research shows that even though the EU is a union based on certain norms and values, there is little to prove that its norms have been internalised by <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries.</b> Therefore, if the intention would be to speed up the enlargement process and ensure future unity, more attention needs to be given to the normative basis of EU foreign policy...|$|R

Small open economies rely heavily on international trade and are highly integrated in global production networks but have so far been hardly considered in the literature. On the example of Austria, an industrialized small open economy in central Europe, we addressed the role of small open economies in a globalized economy. Based on the WIOD database we apply network analysis and use GVC as well as competiveness indicators to measure the associated risks as well as benefits. Findings imply for Austria a sharp turn in the focus of trade policy away from the traditional gross trade perspective. Austria's competitiveness has been strengthened considerably via the participation in GVCs since resource and endowment constraints have been overcoming easier and foreign inputs {{are used in the}} production processes efficiently enabling vast economies of scale. Results also reveal that the promotion of service oriented activities which are a main source of the domestic value added content in manufacturing exports is of key importance for Austria's competitiveness on the global market. In particular we found a mutual integration of EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> of 2004 and Austria: Austria's intermediate exports are mainly characterized by high knowledge- and service-intensive manufacturing goods, while the EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> of 2004 specialize in low-skilled employment and less knowledge intensive services...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} a double goal. On one side {{we want to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of economic integration on migration flows moving from the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> towards the EU- 15; on the other, we want to analyse whether the migration flows had any impact over employment, real wages and labour force in the receiving countries of the European labour market. Due {{to the fact that}} economic integration can be observed in different real, monetary and financial phenomena, we refer to three of these to measure integration: trade openness, trade integration and financial market integration. These indicators have been inserted in a theoretical model that tries to explain labour market dynamics. The theoretical context that seemed the most suitable one to summarise European labour market characteristics is {{a modified version of the}} insider/outsider model proposed by Layard, Nickell and Jackman (LNJ, 1991). Another innovative contribution is the introduction of an equation modelling migration flows, whose creation is inspired to the neo-classic approach to the migration theory (Harris-Todaro, 1970). The model based on rational expectations is solved to find the equilibrium solution and the impact multipliers. Subsequently we estimated a structural VAR with the aim of both evaluating the impact that different shocks on integration measures have on migration flows, and measuring the type of effects that an increase in migration flows causes on the labour market. The estimates show that economic integration generate relevant effects on migration flows from the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> towards the EU- 15 countries.

40|$|Recent European Union (EU) {{directives}} in {{the environmental}} field have promoted sustainable development alongside new modes of environmental governance for achieving this elusive goal. These modes are characterised by integrated, participatory and transparent decision-making processes. This paper provides a conceptual clarification of this new environmental governance and then examines {{the extent to which}} it is being promoted, through Europeanization, in one of the impending south-eastern <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries,</b> Turkey. Empirical data is taken from an analysis of Turkey's progress in adopting the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive which – potentially at least – embodies features of the new environmental governance. A key finding is that there are close links between the adoption of the new modes of environmental governance and the power of ‘Europeanization discourses’ in national policy making processes, but these are insufficient to forge significant changes in inter-sectoral working around environmental issues, or markedly expand opportunities for public participation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{framework}} to assess impacts of various policy options and transport infrastructure investments on accessibility at European level. In order to test the developed framework, impacts of transport infrastructure projects co-funded by the Cohesion Fund and ERDF between 2000 and 2006 were analyzed in terms of accessibility and territorial cohesion. These projects aimed at improving road and rail transport networks in the peripheral and/or <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> while connecting them to the core network. Their impact on accessibility of regions was evaluated for passenger transport using an appropriate combination of various accessibility indicators. At first, the travel costs with and without the improved infrastructure were estimated using the TRANS-TOOLS model (Tools for Transport Forecasting and Scenario Testing; the Europe-wide transport network model used as one of the main reference tools for impact assessments by the European Commission); then, the output of the model was used to compute regional accessibilities at NUTS 3 level in Europe.

Chapter 18 of the acquis foresees the conduct of a population census by <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries.</b> This has proven to be more challenging in the post-war environment of the former Yugoslavia than in other countries. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the attributes of ethnicity and territory increased in importance as they were used to set or consolidate new borders and distribute rights and power according to population numbers and concentration. The sensitive aspects of ethnicity, language and religion, and the simple definition of the census category of ‘place of usual residence’ complicate the collection of census data in the region. This complication is rooted in the potential for an increase or decrease of ‘ethnic’ population numbers that can lead to the loss of rights or political influence. The significance of these aspects has been underestimated by the EU, which approaches the collection of population data as a rather technical exercise.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impact of the recent enlargement of the European Union to Central and Eastern Europe on the internal organization structure and functioning of the European Parliament. The analysis focuses on the differing cultures of political and partisan activity in the new member states in comparison to both the member-states in Western Europe and the European Parliament itself. Although the research presented is preliminary in nature, it suggests that the absorption of members from new member states into the existing supranational party structures may be difficult due to the variations in ideological perspectives and norms of internal party organization between East and West. There are, however, other aspects of the EP that may facilitate the integration of new members from the East into the EP as a whole. In particular, this research highlights the weakness of the national party systems and subsequent development of independent parliaments with strong and active committees in the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries.</b> Both of these developments have led to a comparatively high level of independent legislative influence for both committees and rank-and-file members. In many ways this is similar to the situation in the EP (albeit for different reasons).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address two {{relevant}} issues among those characterising the macroeconomic literature on migration. (a) We evaluate which impact is produced by the immigration flows coming from the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> on the EU- 15 labour market. (b) We draw clues on the migrant characteristics as for their skill levels. We adopt an insider/outsider model inspired by that of Amisano and Serati (2003), but enlarged in order to model the migration flows and fit to wage, participation and employment differentials between skilled and unskilled workers. We identify the structural shocks of the reduced VAR form of the model through sign restrictions imposed to the Impulse Response Functions, leaving unconstrained only the impact multipliers of relative (skilled to unskilled) wage, employment and labour force {{with respect to a}} migration shock. This is equivalent to adopt an agnostic approach, letting emerge freely the signals coming from the data: combining them with theoretical suggestions we derive at least weak indications {{on the fact that the}} skill mix of migrants is either biased towards high or low qualified labour. It does emerge that migration from Eastern European countries towards the EU- 15 is mainly constituted by skilled workers and generates effects of reduction of the employment gap; on the other side, it enlarges the skilled to unskilled relative wage gap. The whole picture suggests the adoption of policies aimed at attract skilled migration through economic but also social and environmental incentives. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper has}} two objectives. Firstly, {{we wish to}} {{evaluate}} whether a greater economic integration has effects, and of what type, on migration flows from Central and Eastern Europe (New Member States of the EU, NMS) towards the fifteen countries of the European Union (EU- 15). Secondly, we wish to understand what effect the migration flows from the NMS have on the labour market of the receiving countries in the EU- 15. The most suitable theoretical context that seems to summarise European labour market characteristics {{is that of the}} insider/outsider model by Layard, Nickell and Jackman (Layard et al., 1991). We have modified the above mentioned model by introducing two innovations. Firstly, we constructed three measures that act as a proxy for economic integration: the Intra Regional Trade Index (IRTI), Global Trade Index (GTI) and Financial Market Integration (FMI). Then we placed the three indicators into the insider/outsider model to arrive at a modified version of Layard, Nickell and Jackman (Layard et al., 1991). The second innovative contribution was the introduction of an equation modelling migration flows. The creation of this equation is inspired by the neo-classical approach to migration theory (Harris-Todaro, 1970). The theoretical model, based on rational expectations, has been solved to find the equilibrium solution and the impact multipliers. We then carried out an empirical analysis, which involved estimating a Structural Vector Autoregression Model (SVAR). The aim of this estimation was to evaluate, on the one hand, the effect that greater European integration (a positive shock to the integration indicators) has on migration flows, and, on the other, to measure the type of effect that migration flows could have on the labour market of the EU- 15 countries, considered as a single entity. The results of our empirical evidence show that economic integration does generate significant effects on migration flows from the <b>enlargement</b> <b>countries</b> towards the EU- 15 countries.

Two years down the road of <b>enlargement,</b> some <b>countries</b> are now liberalizing worker flows. Indeed, as shown in this paper, these restrictions are not justified by migration pressures and rely on ill-founded concerns that nominal convergence could delay real convergence. Moreover, they are mutually inconsistent: delaying EMU convergence would just worsen labour market conditions with respect to a scenario of relatively rapid Euro convergence, by increasing real interest rates and negatively affecting FDI directed to the New Member States. This ultimately means that delaying EMU convergence may backfire in terms of stronger East-West migration pressures.
