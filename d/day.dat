Eight, thirty and twenty fullsibs progenies in three different maize varieties was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with replicate thrice in three rows of three meter length. Analysis of variance showed that Azam was highly significant for <b>days</b> to anthesis, <b>days</b> to silking and grain yield. Similarly, Pahari and Iqbal showed highly significant difference for <b>days</b> to anthesis, <b>days</b> to silking, <b>days</b> to maturity and grain yield.

Lowest <b>days</b> to anthesis (57 <b>days),</b> <b>days</b> to silking (60 <b>days),</b> anthesis to silking interval (ASI) (2 <b>days)</b> and <b>days</b> to maturity (93 <b>days)</b> was recorded by Pahari- 4, Pahari- 3, Pahari- 1 and Pahari- 27 while highest (4. 84 Kg/plot) was showed by Pahari- 14. <b>Days</b> to anthesis, <b>days</b> to silking, anthesis to silking interval (ASI), <b>days</b> to maturity and grain yield of Iqbal- 8 (57 <b>days),</b> Iqbal- 2 (60 <b>days),</b> Iqbal- 2 (2 <b>days)</b> and Iqbal- 1 (94 <b>days)</b> was observed low values while Iqbal- 17 observed high (3. 1713  kg/plot) values for grain yield. Correlation of Azam showed that <b>days</b> to silking with <b>days</b> to anthesis; <b>days</b> to maturity with <b>days</b> to anthesis and <b>days</b> to silking observed highly significant while <b>days</b> to maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed that <b>days</b> to silking with <b>days</b> to anthesis; <b>days</b> to maturity with <b>days</b> to anthesis and <b>days</b> to silking; grain yield with <b>days</b> to maturity observed highly significant but grain yield with <b>days</b> to anthesis and <b>days</b> to silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed that <b>days</b> to silking with <b>days</b> to anthesis; <b>days</b> to maturity with <b>days</b> to anthesis and <b>days</b> to silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with <b>days</b> to silking and <b>days</b> to maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. This was concluded that Azam shall be included in future maize breeding program because of their short duration between <b>days</b> to silking and <b>days</b> to maturity...|$|R
