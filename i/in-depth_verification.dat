40|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional electromechanical relay and static relay, the algorithm of a digital relay which can execute a variety of operations is also more complex; this necessitates a more <b>in-depth</b> <b>verification</b> of the digital relay algorithm. More recently, this has been done through software simulation. Power systems are simulated using EMTP, while relay models can be modeled using any high level language or available software package, such as MATLAB, FORTRAN, C, etc. The interaction between power system and relay models is implemented by using model interface. Methods of model interface are classified as playback or open-loop simulation, and real-time or closed-loop simulation. This paper presents an implementation of the current differential relay and the directional comparison relay using EMTP MODELS based on closed-loop simulation tools. Because EMTP MODELS is a PC-based closed-loop simulation tool, simulation can be tested dynamically, and also the cost is low. The current differential relay and directional comparison relay are realized and they are interfaced with a test power system. Their performances are evaluated for various fault types, fault distances, etc. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the development {{as well as}} the on-ground and the in-flight evaluation of a low cost Global Positioning System (GPS) system for real-time tracking of sounding rockets. The flight unit comprises a modified ORION GPS receiver and a newly designed switchable antenna system composed of a helical antenna in the rocket tip and a dual-blade antenna combination attached to the body of the service module. Aside from the flight hardware a PC based terminal program has been developed to monitor the GPS data and graphically displays the rocket's path during the flight. In addition an Instantaneous Impact Point (IIP) prediction is performed based on the received position and velocity information. In preparation for ESA's Maxus- 4 mission, a sounding rocket test flight was carried out at Esrange, Kiruna, on 19 Feb. 2001 to validate existing ground facilities and range safety installations. Due to the absence of a dedicated scientific payload, the flight offered the opportunity to test multiple GPS receivers and assess their performance for the tracking of sounding rockets. In addition to the ORION receiver, an Ashtech G 12 HDMA receiver and a BAE (Canadian Marconi) Allstar receiver, both connected to a wrap-around antenna, have been flown on the same rocket as part of an independent experiment provided by the Goddard Space Flight Center.

The investigations have not yet been terminated, and the ensuing conclusions are preliminary. The purpose of the investigations was to try out various types of verificational analyses referred to in the preceding article. The analyses concerned the investigations conducted specially for that purpose, with the use of short questionnaire interviews with young workers. Four types of analyses were performed: 1. external analysis using the files data (11 questions); 2. external analysis using an <b>in-depth</b> <b>verification</b> interview of a quality check-type; 3. internal analysis {{with the use of the}} interviews about the interviews based on the models describing the processes, and internal reactions of respondents to every, question (7 question); 4 psychological tests. Verification interviews were conducted in case an answer to a questionnaire question did not bring the information desired, or in case an interview about an interview showed that the process of the answer formation was inappropriate. The greatest importance was attached to the internal verification. Materials were gathered by sociology students subjected to 10 days intensive training; they were strictly supervised in their work by research workers who were elaborating later the data collected. The coding of the tape-recorded data was done by research workers. The articles presented contain the analytical description and evaluation of various methods used in the investigations. The main results show that, from among 7 questions subjected to verification, only one question turned out to be appropriate, as evidenced by 90 % of correct answers; the remaining questions led to a considerable number of errors; in case of two questions the errors and information lacunae appeared in 70 % of the answers. The verification procedures turned out to be efficient; their efficiency being evidenced by the fact that the results of independently applied tests correlated closely with those obtained by the verification...|$|E
40|$|PROTEUS is a {{suite of}} the {{neutronics}} codes, both old and new, {{that can be used}} within the SHARP codes being developed under the NEAMS program. Discussion here is focused on updates and verification and validation activities of the SHARP neutronics code, DeCART, for application to thermal reactor analysis. As part of the development of SHARP tools, the different versions of the DeCART code created for PWR, BWR, and VHTR analysis were integrated. Verification and validation tests for the integrated version were started, and the generation of cross section libraries based on the subgroup method was revisited for the targeted reactor types. The DeCART code has been reorganized in preparation for an efficient integration of the different versions for PWR, BWR, and VHTR analysis. In DeCART, the old-fashioned common blocks and header files have been replaced by advanced memory structures. However, the changing of variable names was minimized in order to limit problems with the code integration. Since the remaining stability problems of DeCART were mostly caused by the CMFD methodology and modules, significant work was performed to determine whether they could be replaced by more stable methods and routines. The cross section library is a key element to obtain accurate solutions. Thus, the procedure for generating cross section libraries was revisited to provide libraries tailored for the targeted reactor types. To improve accuracy in the cross section library, an attempt was made to replace the CENTRM code by the MCNP Monte Carlo code as a tool obtaining reference resonance integrals. The use of the Monte Carlo code allows us to minimize problems or approximations that CENTRM introduces since the accuracy of the subgroup data is limited by that of the reference solutions. The use of MCNP requires an additional set of libraries without resonance cross sections so that reference calculations can be performed for a unit cell in which only one isotope of interest includes resonance cross sections, among the isotopes in the composition. The OECD MHTGR- 350 benchmark core was simulated using DeCART as initial focus of the verification/validation efforts. Among the benchmark problems, Exercise 1 of Phase 1 is a steady-state benchmark case for the neutronics calculation for which block-wise cross sections were provided in 26 energy groups. This type of problem was designed for a homogenized geometry solver like DIF 3 D rather than the high-fidelity code DeCART. Instead of the homogenized block cross sections given in the benchmark, the VHTR-specific 238 -group ENDF/B-VII. 0 library of DeCART was directly used for preliminary calculations. Initial results showed that the multiplication factors of a fuel pin and a fuel block with or without a control rod hole were off by 6, - 362, and - 183 pcm Dk from comparable MCNP solutions, respectively. The 2 -D and 3 -D one-third core calculations were also conducted for the all-rods-out (ARO) and all-rods-in (ARI) configurations, producing reasonable results. Figure 1 illustrates the intermediate (1. 5 eV - 17 keV) and thermal (below 1. 5 eV) group flux distributions. As seen from VHTR cores with annular fuels, the intermediate group fluxes are relatively high in the fuel region, but the thermal group fluxes are higher in the inner and outer graphite reflector regions than in the fuel region. To support the current project, a new three-year I-NERI collaboration involving ANL and KAERI was started in November 2011, focused on performing <b>in-depth</b> <b>verification</b> and validation of high-fidelity multi-physics simulation codes for LWR and VHTR. The work scope includes generating improved cross section libraries for the targeted reactor types, developing benchmark models for verification and validation of the neutronics code with or without thermo-fluid feedback, and performing detailed comparisons of predicted reactor parameters against both Monte Carlo solutions and experimental measurements. The following list summarizes the work conducted so far for PROTEUS-Thermal Tasks: Unification of different versions of DeCART was initiated, {{and at the same time}} code modernization was conducted to make code unification efficient; (2) Regeneration of cross section libraries was attempted for the targeted reactor types, and the procedure for generating cross section libraries was updated by replacing CENTRM with MCNP for reference resonance integrals; (3) The MHTGR- 350 benchmark core was simulated using DeCART with VHTR-specific 238 -group ENDF/B-VII. 0 library, and MCNP calculations were performed for comparison; and (4) Benchmark problems for PWR and BWR analysis were prepared for the DeCART verification/validation effort. In the coming months, the work listed above will be completed. Cross section libraries will be generated with optimized group structures for specific reactor types...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{availability}} of sequencing technology has enabled understanding of transcriptomes through genome-wide approaches including RNA-sequencing. Contrary {{to the previous}} assumption that large tracts of the eukaryotic genomes are not transcriptionally active, recent evidence from transcriptome sequencing approaches have revealed pervasive transcription in many genomes of higher eukaryotes. Many of these loci encode transcripts that have no obvious protein-coding potential and are designated as non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Non-coding RNAs are classified empirically as small and long non-coding RNAs based {{on the size of}} the functional RNAs. Each of these classes is further classified into functional subclasses. Although microRNAs (miRNA), one of the major subclass of ncRNAs, have been extensively studied for their roles in regulation of gene expression and involvement in a large number of patho-physiological processes, the functions of a large proportion of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) still remains elusive. We hypothesized that some lncRNAs could potentially be processed to small RNA and thus could have a dual regulatory output. Results Integration of large-scale independent experimental datasets in public domain revealed that certain well studied lncRNAs harbor small RNA clusters. Expression analysis of the small RNA clusters in different tissue and cell types reveal that they are differentially regulated suggesting a regulated biogenesis mechanism. Conclusions Our analysis suggests existence of a potentially novel pathway for lncRNA processing into small RNAs. Expression analysis, further suggests that this pathway is regulated. We argue that this evidence supports our hypothesis, though limitations of the datasets and analysis cannot completely rule out alternate possibilities. Further <b>in-depth</b> experimental <b>verification</b> of the observation could potentially reveal a novel pathway for biogenesis.

40|$|Earthquake-resistant {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) high-rise wall buildings are designed and detailed to respond {{well beyond the}} elastic range under the expected earthquake ground motions. However, despite their considerable section depth, in terms of analysis, RC walls are still often treated as linear elements, ignoring the effect of deformation compatibility. Due to {{the limited number of}} available comprehensive experimental studies on RC structural wall systems subjected to cycling loading, few <b>in-depth</b> analytical <b>verification</b> studies have been conducted. Motivated by the increasing need for more accurate seismic risk assessment of high-rise buildings in multi-scenario seismic regions, a multi-level nonlinear modeling verification scheme is presented in this paper to investigate two different nonlinear modeling techniques for shear walls (2 - and 4 -noded fiber-based elements). The investigated modeling approaches and their key parameters are verified against the results of Phase I of uniaxial shaking table specimen tests (performed at the University of California, San Diego) on a seven-story full-scale RC shear wall structure under base excitations representing four earthquake records of increasing intensities. Three numerical models are created using two different tools (ZEUS-NL and PERFORM- 3 D). The results obtained from the numerical models are compared with the experimental results both on global and local response levels (top displacement, interstory drift, story shear force, story bending moment, period elongation and rebar tensile strain). The study reveals the superior performance of 4 -noded fiber-based wall/shell element modeling approach in accounting for the 3 D effects of deformation compatibility between lateral and gravity-force-resisting systems. The study also highlights the sensitivity of attained results to the stiffnesses assigned to the rigid links and 3 D joints required to connect the shear walls to neighboring elements when a 2 -noded element is used...|$|R

Also, multiple distances are measured and compared to the obtained inverse solutions. The flat top cover of the hard disk is scanned by a traversed laser vibration system. These velocities of the cover are compared to inverse solutions of the particle velocity at the source plane, where both sound pressure and particle velocity are used to obtain these results.

40|$|Poverty and {{inequality}} in South Africa {{are a result}} of the impact of apartheid policy, which inter alia stripped people of their assets, especially land, distorted economic markets and social institutions through racial discrimination, and resulted in violence and destabilization. This has shaped the nature of poverty in South Africa. In view of the above, the South African government has introduced a programme known as the Comprehensive Rural Development Strategy in order to redress the imbalances of the former apartheid regime. In this strategy it is envisaged that vibrant, equitable and sustainable rural communities and food security for all will be achieved. In this study, I investigated the implementation of rural development programmes in the Mbhashe local municipality of the Eastern Cape Province in order to determine appropriate intervention strategies. This study focused on Ward 18 of Mbhashe local municipality on a village known as Nkwalini Bafazi. This is a village that has been earmarked by the government to be a pilot site for the Rural Development Programme. This project is at the initial stage of social facilitation. In other words this research project is designed to investigate the process of Rural Development and how it can be implemented in the Mbhashe Local municipality in order to alleviate poverty and underdevelopment. For the purpose of the study, a mixed research approach was chosen.

40|$|Many {{households}} in South Africa {{are exposed to}} extreme food insecurity that threatens their livelihoods. Authorities in the local sphere of government have employed food security strategies to curb the trail of food insecurity that prevails in many rural households. However, high levels of food insecurity in many {{households in}} across the country, especially those living in rural areas like Qamata Village, are noteworthy. Contributing factors to this problem are attributed to local government’s inability to successfully stimulate agricultural production {{in the face of}} climate change. The research aimed at assessing the impact of Qamata Irrigation Scheme intervention programmes or strategies in Qamata Village. It was discovered that livelihoods of many households in Qamata Village rely heavily on agricultural production to access food. Limited government support, poor planning and failure to invest on climate change adaptation strategies were identified as serious impediments in the implementation of food security strategies. Due to the enormity of the problem and extensive nature of local government, this study focussed on the Qamata Irrigation Scheme, in the Qamata Village within Chris Hani District Municipality. For the purposes of this study, qualitative research methods were used to gather an <b>in-depth</b> understanding and <b>verification</b> of the problem. Research tools used were mainly semi structured interviews and focus group discussions. Interviews were conducted with farmers in the Qamata Irrigation Scheme and focus group discussion were held with dry land farming households in the Qamata Village and representatives from the CHDM.

Land reform {{is one of the}} initiatives that the democratic government has implemented post 1994 to enable the previously marginalised and disposed individuals and families to own land. The aim of the land reform was not only to provide settlement beneficiaries, but to provide post settlement support to them and enable them to live a better life. However, most of the beneficiaries who acquired farms through the land reform programs lack practical experience in commercial agricultural production. In light of the above, the agricultural mentorship programme was implemented to offer a ray of sunshine to smallholder and emerging farmers. However, it is quite evident that although the agricultural mentorship program was implemented, the Kat river valley emerging citrus farmers are still facing challenges such as limited production capacity; limited access to financial capital; limited access to production equipment; and limited post-harvest support. This study aims to review the agriculture mentorship programme of the Department of Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (DRDAR), with a specific focus on citrus at Kat River Valley. Using data drawn from a sample of nine (9) mentees, two (2) mentors and one official from DARDAR who were personally visited and interviewed, the thesis presents the results of an assessment of the program’s outcomes for participant’s experiences and perceptions in order to strengthen the programme.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. LGED has the reputation as an “island of excellence” in the Government, with high standards of professionalism, and comparatively robust risk management systems. The report begins with a brief assessment of external environmental factors that affect LGED’s ability to adopt reforms to effectively address potential fiduciary & operational risks throughout the value chain of public expenditure for rural and urban infrastructure. This study has examined the present operations management practices of large fleet of vehicles at LGED Head Quater and analyze its effectiveness and compliance with existing rules and regulations of Bangladesh. To fulfill the overall objective of this study has undergone an <b>in-depth</b> procedure on <b>verification</b> of vehicle usages and allocation of vehicle procedures, it estimate preparation and approval procedures for maintenance, procurement process, has also checked procurement process {{as a tool for}} Public Procurement Rules (PPR- 2008). Factors at the national level include weaknesses in electoral, legislative, judicial and agency accountability, outmoded civil service rules and practices, lack of national audit capacity, and high levels of corruption. Progress in nationwide reforms for combating corruption and improving financial management and procurement has been encouraging in recent years, but there is a risk that it may not be sustained by the next political government. At the sub-national level, LGED is subject to two lines of accountability. On the one hand, LGED has a sizeable budget of its own for implementing infrastructure programs at various levels of government. Here there is a strong emphasis on administrative and financial procedures to ensure the probity, integrity and effectiveness of activities. On the other hand, LGED also implements and manages rural and urban infrastructure funded under Annual Development Program allocations of sub national jurisdictions. In these cases, while there is a clearer accountability link to beneficiaries through their elected officials, risks can still arise due to weaknesses in local governance in planning, decision making and management. These risks need to be mitigated through local government reforms that will create a more efficient, effective and transparent environment within which LGED can function in the future. The report gives a brief internal organizational assessment of LGED, reviewing its evolution from a rural works component of the integrated rural development program of the early 1960 s to its formalization and rapid growth as a public sector department. Key functions are assessed, including human resources and financial management, procurement, engineering and ICT systems, corporate governance, and approach to land use and resettlement. The report confirms LGED’s excellent reputation for professionalism, including quality delivery of many contracts on time and on budget. Although information and communication systems are relatively advanced in LGED compared to other government departments, the use of many different, non-integrated systems with inadequate supervision by core staff with ICT skills make it difficult for LGED to gather critical information needed to compare the results of the various projects, and complicates the reporting and control procedures within LGED (e. g. benchmarking, and detecting patterns indicating possible collusion on bids).
