5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
25|$|The very {{existence}} of the outer world seemed a base mockery, a cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless beauty. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> flowers, for I had seen the enameled meads of Paradise; I cursed the rocks because they were mute stone, the sky because it rang with no music; and the earth and sky seemed to throw back my curse....|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

He further stated that [...] "this is from someone who was quoted early on as saying <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> them.

500|$|Hastings {{was born}} on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a {{solicitor}} with [...] "somewhat seedy clients", and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying [...] "I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the masters; above all <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the work, which never interested me in the slightest degree". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.|$|E

50|$|On {{politics}}, Latham commented in 2002: I'm a hater. Part of the tribalness {{of politics}} is to really dislike {{the other side}} with intensity. And the more I see of them the more <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> their negativity. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> their narrowness. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> the way, for instance, John Howard tries to appeal to suburban values when I know that he hasn't got any real answers to the problems and challenges we face. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> the phoniness of that.|$|R
500|$|Richardson {{later told}} Inside Soap that he hated Ste {{when he first}} joined the show, adding: [...] "When {{he came into the}} show Ste {{was a bit of a}} skater boy, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> that."

500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|Johnny {{obtained}} {{more control}} over the musical style because the band members experienced conflict amongst themselves, specifically rooted in each member—excluding Johnny—facing issues with addiction. Both Joey and drummer Marky Ramone were dealing with alcoholism, while bassist Dee Dee Ramone was severely addicted to cocaine and was undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment. Since the Ramones' previous two releases had producers which proved disappointing to the members, they were skeptical of the upcoming producer; this would be Ritchie Cordell, with whom they also had issues. Marky relates: [...] "I hated the production, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the producer." ...|$|E

500|$|However, not all critics {{share the}} {{positive}} view towards Juno. David Edelstein of New York magazine {{felt that the}} film was desperate to be [...] "a movie that confers hipness on teens, that makes kids {{want to use the}} same slang and snap up the soundtrack". Music reviewer Jim DeRogatis criticized the film's stylized dialogue and what he saw as a casual take on abortion and Juno's naïveté in becoming pregnant, claiming: [...] "As an unapologetically old-school feminist, the father of a soon-to-be-teenage daughter, a reporter who regularly talks to actual teens as part of his beat and a plain old moviegoer, <b>I</b> <b>hated,</b> hated, hated this movie." ...|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I looked at what I had done in it, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> my own performance.

500|$|A November 2005 demo {{contained}} thirteen songs, {{which included}} rough versions of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] and [...] "Halo".

[...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production.

500|$|In 1960, McGovern {{decided to}} run for the U.S.Senate and {{challenge}} the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite. The race centered mostly around rural issues, but John F. Kennedy's Catholicism was a drawback {{at the top of the}} ticket in the mostly Protestant state. McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, [...] "It was my worst campaign. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> [...] so much I lost my sense of balance." [...] McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt's 160,579, but the margin was one-third of Kennedy's loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state's presidential contest.|$|E

Washington's Up From Slavery (1901), the autobiography of an American former slave; Achebe [...] "found it sad, but it showed him another dimension of reality". He also read classic novels, such as Gulliver's Travels (1726), David Copperfield (1850), and Treasure Island (1883), together with tales of colonial derring-do such as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain (1887) and John Buchan's Prester John (1910). Achebe later recalled that, as a reader, he [...] "took sides with the white characters against the savages" [...] and even developed a dislike for Africans. [...] "The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or, at the most, cunning. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> their guts." ...|$|E

Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon.
