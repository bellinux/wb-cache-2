Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the <b>external</b> <b>shell,</b> a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

The class now contains two, only distantly related, extant subclasses: Coleoidea, which includes octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish; and Nautiloidea, represented by Nautilus and Allonautilus. In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, {{whereas in the}} Nautiloidea, the <b>external</b> <b>shell</b> remains. About 800 living species of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonoidea (ammonites) and Belemnoidea (belemnites).|$|E
25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the <b>external</b> <b>shell.</b> The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} <b>external</b> <b>shell.</b> At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E

The oldest known octopus fossil is Pohlsepia, which lived 296 million years ago. Researchers have identified impressions of eight arms, two eyes, and possibly an ink sac. Octopuses are mostly soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. Octopuses, squids and cuttlefish belong to the clade Coleoidea. They are known as [...] "soft-bodied" [...] cephalopods, lacking the <b>external</b> <b>shell</b> of most molluscs and other cephalopods like the Nautiloids and the extinct Ammonoidea.

2500|$|Nautiluses are {{the only}} extant {{cephalopods}} with a true <b>external</b> <b>shell.</b> However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in cuttlefish (Sepia spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell (cuttlebone) that is internal in the adult.

Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports, which are sometimes referred to as a [...] "shell vestige" [...] or [...] "gladius". The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an internal shell, and some squid also lack a gladius.

60|$|The {{extrinsic}} muscles {{which serve}} {{to move the}} whole external ear, and the intrinsic muscles which move the different parts, all of which belong to {{the system of the}} panniculus, are in a rudimentary condition in man; they are also variable in development, or at least in function. I have seen one man who could draw his ears forwards, and another who could draw them backwards;[25] and from what one of these persons told me, it is probable that most of us by often touching our ears and thus directing our attention towards them, could by repeated trials recover some power of movement. The faculty of erecting the ears and of directing them to different points of the compass, is no doubt of the highest service to many animals, as they thus perceive the point of danger; but I have never heard of a man who possessed the least power of erecting his ears,—the one movement which might be of use to him. The whole <b>external</b> <b>shell</b> of the ear may be considered a rudiment, together with the various folds and prominences (helix and anti-helix, tragus and anti-tragus, &c.) which in the lower animals strengthen and support the ear when erect, without adding much to its weight. Some authors, however, suppose that the cartilage of the shell serves to transmit vibrations to the acoustic nerve; but Mr. Toynbee,[26] after collecting all the known evidence on this head, concludes that the <b>external</b> <b>shell</b> is of no distinct use. The ears of the chimpanzee and orang are curiously like those of man, and I am assured by the keepers in the Zoological Gardens that these animals never move or erect them; so that they are in an equally rudimentary condition, as far as function is concerned, as in man. Why these animals, as well as the progenitors of man, should have lost the power of erecting their ears we cannot say. It may be, though I am not quite satisfied with this view, that owing to their arboreal habits and great strength they were but little exposed to danger, and so during a lengthened period moved their ears but little, and thus gradually lost the power of moving them. This would be a parallel case with that of those large and heavy birds, which from inhabiting oceanic islands have not been exposed to the attacks of beasts of prey, and have consequently lost the power of using their wings for flight.|$|E
60|$|The Young Cirripede {{within the}} Larva.--Several times I succeeded in {{dissecting}} off the integuments of the lately-attached larva, and in displaying the young Lepas australis entire. The following description {{applies to the}} Cirripede in this state; but for convenience sake, I shall occasionally refer to its condition when a little more advanced. I may premise, and the fact in itself is curious, that the bivalve-like shell of the larva, together with the compound eyes, is first moulted, and some time afterwards, the inner lining of the sack, together with the integuments of the thorax and of the natatory legs: hence, I often found specimens, which externally seemed to have perfected their metamorphoses, but which, within their sacks, retained all the characters of the natatory larva. According to Mr. King, the larva of Lepas throws off its <b>external</b> <b>shell</b> five days after becoming attached. Whilst the young Lepas is closely packed within the larva, the capitulum, as known by the five valves, about equals in length the peduncle. The peduncle occupies the anterior half of the larva; when fully stretched, it becomes narrower and slightly longer than the capitulum; the separation between the capitulum and peduncle is almost arbitrary in the mature animal, and corresponds with no particular line in the larva. Even at this early period, {{the muscles of the}} peduncle are quite distinct. No vestige is preserved in the outer integument, of the sternal and dorsal sutures of the larval carapace; but in the corium of the peduncle, three coloured marks which occur near the eyes, and two little curled marks which occur near the acoustic orifices of the larva, are all preserved for some time after maturity. The compound eyes, as we have seen, are attached to apodemes, springing from the sternal surface of the larval carapace, and are consequently cast off with it: whilst the young Cirripede is packed within the larva, the outer integument of its peduncle necessarily forms a deep transverse fold passing over the eyes and apodemes, and this, as we shall presently see, plays an important part in the future position of the animal. The antennæ are not moulted with the carapace, but left cemented to the surface of attachment; their muscles are converted into sinewy fibres, the corium after a short period is absorbed, and they are then preserved in a functionless condition. No trace of the two acoustic sacks can be perceived in the corium of the young Cirripede, excepting the coloured marks above alluded to.|$|E

Jeletzky (in Bandel 1985) considered that aulocerids were essentially ectocochleate and that they lacked a muscular mantle, the rostrum having been secreted by mantle flaps that could be folded over the chambered shell, but were not fused around it, and which could be withdrawn into the long living chamber.|$|R

40|$|Stress {{analysis}} of the coil winding packs of the production solenoid indicates acceptable conductor stresses for a structural concept which employs <b>external</b> <b>shells</b> {{to contribute to the}} support of the coil hoop stresses. The recommendation of external shells/mandrels as a support scheme results from the advantage in conductor stress, from the need to bridge axial loads around the thin coil sections, and the need to have a reliable attachment point for the cold mass support. The external shell/mandrel allows freedom in selecting higher conductor current density, while controlling the conductor hoop stress with a thicker shell. Additional nuclear heat in the thicker <b>external</b> <b>shells</b> may be removed separately from the winding pack. Conductor and coil analyses are preliminary, subject to final conductor and current selection. A cold mass support scheme employing flexures to support the axial attractive force between the production and transport solenoids is explored. It's use to support the deadweight of the coil would require wide flexures, more like a skirt, and it is likely that vertical support rods will be required, at least at the high field end of the production solenoid, if not at both ends. The cryostat inner shell was modeled as 2 cm thick and is capable of supporting the nuclear shield (up to 70 tons) - but the analysis has only considered the shield in it's assembled location in which the end caps of the cryostat stabilize the shell.

In addition, the diameters of borings in Cloudina are proportional to the sizes of specimens, which suggests that predators were selective about the size of their prey. These two indications that predators attacked selectively suggest the possibility of speciation in response to predation, which is often postulated as a potential cause of the rapid diversification of animals in the Early Cambrian.|$|R
