5000|$|James Swindal {{suggests}} that Kompridis {{has not taken}} more recent work of Habermas' fully into account, but that nonetheless, [...] "this is a book {{that needed to be}} written" [...] because [...] "Habermas’s critique of disclosure was at times narrow and short-sighted. But as Habermas is now rethinking some of these shortcomings, Kompridis gives him - and indeed all critical theorists - ample resources" [...] for a better balance between disclosure and procedural thinking. Similarly, Dana Villa writes that [...] "Kompridis argues—persuasively, <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> that contemporary critical theory would do well to abandon its insistence that communicative rationality is the quasi-transcendental core of democratic legitimacy" [...] and rethink its suspicion of world disclosure.|$|E

According to Wright:It was decided to shoot tho Cup scene first. A grey — Fitz Merv, <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> won the handicap which was to represent {{the race for the}} Sydney Cup, after making a brilliant run in the straight {{from the rear of the}} field. This was a tiny stroke of luck for the producer who thereupon secured a grey horse to be used right through the picture, and when he was seen winning the Cup in the final scene the fans went crazy with delight.

He had become cinematographer for the Australian Film Syndicate after Lacey Percival left the company to join the Australian Photo-Play Company.|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} based on a research. In my {{dissertation}} I am going to compare the ways English and Hungarian children use computers. My assumption is that the computer is less used for learning or getting information in Hungary than in England. I assume that both countries’ children use the computer for keeping contact, chatting and playing games. We know that more developed computers require skilled users. <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> it will be proven that Hungarian students own less developed tools; consequently they have less knowledge in the field of Computer Science. Hungarian learners are less familiar with Information Technology while the computer is used widely among English students. This essay tries to find the reasons and analyze the data of my survey. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|E

30|$|I {{will say}} that I {{had a lot of}} anxiety about going into the testing center in second semester, the first time, because I had overheard several of our {{students}} in our class say exactly what you just stated, that it does not prepare you for the real world and there were several comments made in second semester about those ‘special’ people who went to the testing center. And it was hurtful in the moment, but I came to the realization that I’m here for me, that I am here for my success, Jacob’s {{not going to do it}} for me (pointing to Jacob), Emerson’s not going to do it for me (pointing to Emerson). Nobody at this table is going to help me to get to where I need to be and pass the N-CLEX and go to work. It’s on me. And so I had to put those comments- which caused me a huge amount of anxiety about what people would <b>think-</b> <b>I</b> had to put that out of my mind and do what I needed to do to be successful in nursing school.

40|$|Scientists are {{becoming}} increasingly {{aware of the need}} to ap-proach their teachingwith the same expectations for evidence that they use in their science. They are coming to recognize that, just as in science research, research on undergraduate science education has a literature as well as standards for practice. I (M. L. L.) am a recent convert to this way of <b>think-ing.</b> <b>I</b> taught for 30 years using mostly a lecture style and believed myself quite revolutionary when I used projected images to make cell biological points in class. I now teach us-ing the results of discipline-based education research (DBER) and domy best to use instructional strategies that are demon-strated to improve student learning. As this pool of converts grows, so too grows the number of individuals who are formally trained as scientists but are in-terested in using research-based approaches to teaching or in contributing to the literature of DBER themselves. Discipline-Based Education Research: A Scientist’s Guide was written with both audiences in mind. It does not “preach to the choir. ” Rather, it opens the door to admit the convert, providing a guide to the purposes, findings, andpractices ofDBER,which are often elusive and opaque to scientists. Given the title and content of the book, we were surprised not to find a clearly stated definition of DBER. Although the authors identified themselves as discipline-based education researchers (astronomy education researchers, in particular), they did not articulate howDBER differs from science educa-tion research or education research in general. We expect tha...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a product of a two month's visit- my first- which I paid to Brazil this summer. 1 I went with the {{intention}} of finding a good site for future fieldwork on Afro-Brazilian cults. Last year I started work on a theoretical paper on these cultB, which I had hoped would lead to a D. Phil. But one result of my visit is that I have decided to limit my research solely to the theoretical paper. In Brazil I spent 2 t weeks. in Rio, eleven days in Salvador, 2 weeks in Recife and one week in Fortaleza and Sao Luis. One of the most unexpected features. of the trip was to discover how deeply anthropologists were involved in the cults they study. The most interesting example of this was in Salvador. So while this paper draws on all my experience (i. e. from other places as well), I shall concentrate on Salvador as the special case. Salvador does have many unique features, and it is perhaps unfair to generalize too widely from it. But there are many lessons- <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> that can be learned about Brazil and about anthropology from the involvement o...|$|E
40|$|Thanks to the Association of American Colleges and Universities, I have {{recently}} been given the wonderful opportunity to direct a project that brings together both regional and specialized accreditors to reflect {{on some of the}} challenges to American higher education as they busy themselves with revising their standards and processes. It {{seems to me that we}} have some grounds for being optimistic about the “little house,” as we’re calling undergraduate colleges, but there will be two or three intermediate steps in reaching that conclusion. The first challenge, I think I’ve learned, is to be very clear about the difference between earning a degree and getting credentialed in something or other. The major difference between these two, as very well explained by Judith Eaton at CHEA, is general education. So, secondly, degree programs will be more what they ought to be and thus perhaps more successful the more they emphasize general education and a major together, rather than the major alone. That will require (third step) a highly integrated approach to student outcomes, curriculum design, and faculty responsibility. Finally, there will result a deeper and wider appreciation for those institutions that can do this best. And <b>I</b> <b>think—</b> to mix the metaphors shamelessly—that undergraduate colleges definitely have a leg up on this approach to higher education...|$|E
40|$|Some days I {{read that}} we at HEFCE are funding 1, 000 s of Intellectual Property (IP) managers. Who are {{managing}} around £ 56 M in licensing income. <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> outrageous. But then I {{think of the}} diversity of our universities and colleges, of their subjects and of their partners in society and the economy. And then I think – hang on, are these all focussed so intently on Intellectual Property that they need 1, 000 s of specialist IP managers? Clearly not – as this report from the Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge and PACEC consultants describes. The report tries to capture the wide range of engagements between higher education and societies and the economy – and the support in place for research translation, development of human capital, soft networks, provision of facilities and civic and community outreach. Such engagements generated at least £ 2. 25 Bn in total value for the economy and society in 2007 - 08. Not that we at HEFCE or HEI leaders and managers should be complacent. HEFCE provides around 2 % of its funds from Government to help HEIs support their engagements with the wider world. This complements project support from such as Research Councils and Regional Development Agencies. We all need to maximise efficiency and effectiveness, both i...|$|E
40|$|One o / the pr inciples oJ {{psychosomatic}} medic ine {{is that we}} need illness as a way oJ expressing our emot ional]eel$ngs [...] . We need illness to dem-onstrate the]act {{that the}} universe is orderly; God does things consistently; His laws cannot be changed nor set aside because someone is ~good; pays his t ithe to the church, says his prayers, and reads his Bible. The Need for Illness F OR MANY YEARS I have been in- terested in the subject of the need for illness. As a military chaplain on active duty for four years, and as a hos-pital chaplain for over nineteen years, I have often seen instances which seemed to illustrate the need for illness. It has been more difficult to see this truth in my own life, but as I have dared look at myself honestly I have had {{to accept the fact that}} I have needed every illness I ever had. I now dare assert he theory that all illness is needed, whether it is realized consciously or not. I do not state this theory lightly nor easily, but only after long and careful self-study, and study of "others. " I am not able to prove this theory objectively. ]'here have been times, especially when I have been ill, when I have revolted violently against it; there have been other times, namely when I have been relatively healthy, when I have seen it clearly. Dr. H. Flanders Dunbar proclaimed some of this insight in her Emotions and Bodily Changes and her more popularIy-written Mind and Body and other writ-ings. My reading of her writings has certainly had its influence on my <b>think-ing.</b> <b>I</b> have often been able to discover in myself and in other patients the close relationship between repressed emotion...|$|R
40|$|Good Morning! We {{can look}} forward to an {{exciting}} week and, more importantly, through our delibera-tions and debates, to making contributions to public policy and political action which will improve the effectiveness ot public health programmes. That is obviously a tall order. but certainly not out of pro-portion to the stature of this audience. The World Health Organization and the Pan Ainerican Health Organization are pleased to be sponsors of this coin-ference and are glad to join with the many oLher sponsors who are such distinguished actors in the arena of public health. I will not try to keep you in suspense about whether or not I think discase elimination and eradi-cation are potcntially effective public health strate-gies. in case any ot you were wondering. I think they certainly can bc effective. And while <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> they have a number ot especially attractive attributes as strategies. I see them as part of a continuum of strat-egies bounded on one side by global disease eradica-tion- that is, zero cases and zero risk of cases, and on the other by disease control- tlat is, a reduction in cases by sonie defined amount. Inteirmediarv straL-egies would include disease elimination (zero cases but willi continuing risk) and our famous WHO term. elinination of the disease as a public lhealth problem (reduction ot cases below what is consid-ered to be a public health risk) So. given my general support. I would likc to direct my remarks to some aspects of these strategies which can bc summarized by three quotaLions: (1) For if the trinmpet give an uncertain souind, who shall prepare himself to the bartle?

40|$|The amazing {{world of}} natural history made its first impact on me during World War I 1 on the {{tropical}} island of Barbados. My Scottish father had become manager of the British Union Oil Company there. a srnall outfit that evplorcd {{for oil and gas}} on the island and refined crude oil from Venezuela. I had arrived in Barbados in Api-il of 1939, and with the outbreak of war and appearance of German U-boats in the region, my family became trapped on the island. As a result. I spent seven of my foi-mative years in a house in the tropics that had a golf cousse at the back and the emerald Caribbean Sea a short distance in front. This is where i t all began. The golf course became my hunting ground for butterflies and bird and reptile eggs. What a challenge i t was to try to net those elusive butterflies or reach a nest way out on a thin limb. Molluscs were also highly sought after. Sunrise Tellins (Tellirm radiata), which we called "auroras " because of their radiating colors, were a special prize. To capture them, I had to pump holes in the shallow back-reef sand with my feet until I could feel one of these slippery bivalves and dive i t up. When slit open and spread out to dry, they resembled butterflies. About the time I started school, I met the "ultimate collector, " Dr Alfred Senn. the British Union Oil Company's geologist. I used to spend hours after school watching him picking microfossils- mostly foraminifera, <b>I</b> <b>think-</b> out of samples and filing them in endless rows of small vials. This was the Iife for me: 1 decided then and there to become an oil company geologist. When the war ended, my father, convinced that an 1 1 -year old who was spending all his spare time in trees or in the sea was simply not taking life seriously enough, decided to ship me off to boarding school in Scotland. There I was expected to develop character and apply myself to more serious studies. So in 1946, still set on becoming an oil company geologist, I headed for the land of chilblains. After completing my secondary education, I turned my gaze to the New World because of the expanding opportunities for work in oil companies there. Though I was accepted at MIT, my father's Scottish roots ran too deep and I entered Queen'...|$|E
