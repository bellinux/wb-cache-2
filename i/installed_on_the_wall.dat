25|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1399, Oswald {{returned}} to the County of Tyrol and began a drawn out quarrel with his older brother Michael about their inheritance. In 1401–02 Oswald participated in the failed Italian expedition of King Rupert of Germany. In 1407 he and his brother finally agreed on how to split the inheritance: Oswald received a third of Castle Hauenstein and the accompanying estates in Seis am Schlern. The other two thirds of the castle belong to a knight named Martin Jäger, but Oswald did not respect the property situation, occupying the entire castle and appropriating Jäger's share of the tithe. In 1408, in preparation for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Oswald paid for a memorial stone to be <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the cathedral in Brixen. The stone has survived, and shows him in the garb of a Crusader, with the long beard associated with pilgrims. Before he left, he wrote several songs for his beloved, Anna Hausmann, the wife of the Brixner burgher Hans Hausmann. After his return in 1410 he acquired the right to take up residence in the Augustiner-Chorherren cloister Neustift near Brixen.|$|E

30|$|In Section “Light {{transport}} in fixture-sensor systems”, {{we discussed}} how {{to obtain the}} light transport matrix in a fixture-sensor system. In this section, we introduce the first approach for estimating the occupancy distribution using the light transport matrix A. This approach requires the color sensors to be <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> room. In Section “Floor-plane occupancy mapping with light reflection model” we will introduce a second approach, which can use ceiling-mounted color sensors.|$|R

50|$|Karol Scherz de Vasoja (1807 - 1888) became {{priest in}} this church in 1855. He was widely {{known for his}} {{charitable}} work and over time he saved the lives of over 50 people during floods and fires. After being accidentally hit by a horse-drawn carriage and dying of his injuries the following day, he was mourned by many citizens of Bratislava. In 1908 a bronze memorial plate by artist Alojz Rigele commemorating Scherz was <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the church.|$|E
50|$|The folded {{ceiling surface}} which follows {{the line of}} the roof acts as a shelter for the house. Instead of {{creating}} a parapet, the roof shifts to two sides and it creates an overhang or eave to the north. With the combination of the dark coloured ceiling and the roof of the house, it visually camouflages itself with the bush landscape. The pocket windows <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> are carved out to provide port holes to isolate and frame the views.|$|E

50|$|Albert and Caroline Cluett made {{alterations}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor, {{raising the}} roof to accommodate the growing needs of their four sons. New oak floors, picture and chair rail mouldings all in the Colonial Revival Style {{were added to the}} two parlors and entrance hall. The old wallpaper was removed and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were painted ivory. A scenic wallpaper from the Zuber & Co. of Paris, France was <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> Entrance Hall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor.|$|R

50|$|In 1936 that roadway {{alignment}} {{was converted}} into a parking area, and the present roadway was completed the following year on the alignment of the railroad bed. The Lynn Rotary was completed in 1935. This work, along with {{the conversion of the}} bridle path to a promenade, was paid for by Works Progress Administration grants. Since then modifications to the roadway have been modest. Seawalls have been built, a chain link fence was <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> between the road and the parking lot, and the rotary was landscaped.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 SMART Technologies {{introduced}} an Interactive Whiteboard. It {{was a large}} touch-sensitive (resistive technology) board mounted on the wall, on which the image from a projector was displayed, that through a USB connection to a computer indicated where the presenter was touching it, allowing the presenter to virtually interact with the computer desktop (as is projected on the board), or to dispense virtual ink to annotate the displayed image. It was not portable, required professional installation and calibration, it worked only when the presenter/teacher is at the board. Other products (Mimio, eBeam) came out after that. Those were “after-market” products that were aimed at working with existing projectors. However, they still required professional installation, calibration, had limited portability once they were <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and still restricted the presenter to the board. Some of those products were incorporated into projectors, thus introducing the interactive projector. Interactive projectors once again require professional installation, are less affordable, and would not work with existing projectors.|$|E
5000|$|After the mid-1970s, Hiller {{continued}} her engagement with Minimalism. For 10 Months (1977-79), she took photographs of her pregnant body and kept a journal documenting the subjective aspects of her pregnancy. The final work comprises ten gridded blocks of twenty-eight {{black and white}} photographs, each block corresponding to a lunar month. The images are accompanied by excerpts from her journal entries for the same period. These components are <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in a stepped pattern that descends from left to right. As Lisa Tickner observed, [...] "The sentimentality associated with images of pregnancy is set tartly on edge by the scrutiny of the woman/artist who is acted upon, but who also acts: who enjoys a precarious status as both the subject and the object of her work...The echoes of landscape, the allusions to ripeness and fulfillment, are refused by the anxieties of the text, and by the methodical process of representation." [...] The work was considered controversial when first exhibited in London.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the experimental work carried out under ‘PROPWALL’, {{a research project}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seismic performance of embedded walls in saturated sand carried out by Transnational Access to the Turner Beam Centrifuge of the University of Cambridge. The experimental equipment, the model preparation and the monitoring devices are described in detail. The results are presented in terms of accelerations, wall deflections, bending moments and excess pore pressures, as monitored by means of <b>the</b> devices <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and within <b>the</b> soil mass...|$|R
50|$|In 2014 Revolter's {{photography}} was <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Studio <b>Wall</b> at Brooks Institute. The images {{he displayed}} questioned the viewers' understanding {{of both the}} meaning, {{and the relationship between}} the photographs.|$|R
5000|$|Metal {{and wood}} framed {{buildings}} - an insulation material <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof, <b>walls</b> and floor prevents thermal short circuit creating the heat transfer through the framing material and controls when desired (winter/summer)resulting in energy savings.|$|R
