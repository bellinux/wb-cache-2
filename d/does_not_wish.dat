The current terminal building dates from 1988; Dash 8 aircraft were introduced in 1994.

Christians, they were called; after Christ their Lord and God. Weak old men, poor women, slaves, even children, were among them. Not many mighty, not many rich, not many noble, were called. They were mostly weak and oppressed people, who had been taught by {{suffering}} and sorrow.|$|R

5|$|Nomura had {{originally}} intended Seifer {{not only as}} Squall's rival, but also {{as part of the}} love triangle between him, Squall, and Rinoa. Although this concept was shelved in the final script, Seifer remains Squall's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall's. They have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces and their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters use gunblades; Squall's gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand. A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts II {{as a member of the}} Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin. Seifer in the virtual Twilight Town is a rival of the main character, Roxas, and at one point mentions that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to cooperate with destiny. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu and Will Friedle in the Japanese and English versions, respectively. He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy VIII.|$|E
5|$|Raghuveer {{discovers that}} Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior. He murders Indu's father and frames Harsha, causing Indu to hate Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries {{to catch them}} but fails; falling into a lake, he faces a near-death {{experience}} and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, and he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E

25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze at You Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together.|$|E
