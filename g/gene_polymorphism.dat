25|$|A {{significant}} {{player in}} the process is transforming growth factor (TGFβ). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of SMAD2/SMAD3, SMAD4 and the inhibitor SMAD7) {{is responsible for the}} secondary messenger system that induces transcription of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. Sp1 is a transcription factor most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGFβ, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has a possible role. Indeed, a common CTGF <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> is present at an increased rate in systemic sclerosis.|$|E

25|$|African iron overload, {{formerly}} known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among people of African descent in Southern Africa. Originally, this was blamed on ungalvanised barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the beer. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get an iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in people of African descent who have had no contact {{with this kind of}} beer (e.g., African Americans). This led investigators to the discovery of a <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> in the gene for ferroportin which predisposes some people of African descent to iron overload.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Glucocorticoids have an {{important}} role in early growth and development. Glucocorticoid receptor <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> have been identified that contribute to the variability in glucocorticoid sensitivity. We examined whether these glucocorticoid receptor <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> are associated with growth in fetal and early postnatal life. Methods This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life onwards. The studied glucocorticoid receptor <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> included Bcl I (rs 41423247), TthIII I (rs 10052957), GR- 9 β (rs 6198), N 363 S (rs 6195) and R 23 K (rs 6789 and 6190). Fetal growth was assessed by ultrasounds in second and third trimester of pregnancy. Anthropometric measurements in early childhood were performed at birth and at the ages of 6, 14 and 24 months postnatally. Analyses focused on weight, length and head circumference. Analyses were based on 2, 414 healthy, Caucasian children. Results Glucocorticoid receptor <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were not associated with fetal weight, birth weight and early postnatal weight. Also, no associations were found with length and head circumference. Neither were these polymorphisms associated with the risks of low birth weight or growth acceleration from birth to 24 months of age. Conclusions We found in a large population-based cohort no evidence for an effect of known glucocorticoid receptor <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> on fetal and early postnatal growth characteristics. Further systematic searches for common genetic variants by means of genome-wide association studies will enable us to obtain a more complete understanding of what <b>genes</b> and <b>polymorphisms</b> are involved in growth in fetal life and infancy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide. The most frequent and severe cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease resulting from coronary arteries’ atherosclerosis. Though many risk factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease have been identified, such as high levels of LDL- and total cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking, researchers have focused on the genetic background of coronary artery disease by analyzing genetic factors that either independently or in interaction with known risk factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetics of cardiovascular disease is a wide field consisting of association studies of <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with disease. Coronary artery disease is a multifactorial disease of complex genetic aetiology and thus there are reports on many gene candidates. The selection of studied <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> is based on the physiology and pathophysiology of the involved system with coronary artery disease and the alterations that <b>polymorphisms</b> of these <b>genes</b> may cause. The association studies of <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with coronary artery disease evaluate and compare the frequency of <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> between patients and healthy controls. The present study is an association study investigating the association of selected <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with coronary artery disease. Our aim is to determine the possible association of <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with coronary artery disease in Greek coronary artery disease patients and to analyze their interaction with patient characteristics, such as previous myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes or according to their smoking habits. We further assessed the synergistic effect on analyzed <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> through <b>gene</b> score application. A total of 154 coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients and 155 non- coronary artery disease controls were included in the study. We have selected this patient atherosclerotic model, as coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a critical well documented endpoint of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The control group consisted of healthy individuals with no clinical evidence of coronary artery disease and also without medical record of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular disease. In total of participants we have genotyped the following polymorphisms: M 235 T and T 174 M <b>polymorphisms</b> of angiotensinogen <b>gene</b> (AGT), I / D polymorphism of angiotensin I converting enzyme gene (ACE), A 1166 C polymorphism of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R), - 786 T> C and G 894 T polymorphisms of the endothelial synthase of nitric oxide gene (eNOS) and the alleles ε 2, ε 3 and ε 4 of apolipoprotein E gene (apoE).
