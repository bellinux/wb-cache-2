40|$|Sex hormones have {{important}} {{interactions with the}} immune system and modulate the inflammatory response. In this regard, oestrogen inhibits the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and confers tissue protection in experimental models. On the basis of this evidence, Trotter et al. in this issue of Critical Care addressed the question of whether, in children, female sex would protect against the deleterious effects of cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass by providing a favourable anti-inflammatory cytokine balance. The observations made in that study suggest sex-related immunomodulation and organ protection during cardiac surgery in the paediatric population. Prospective trials conducted in large series, including sex <b>hormone</b> <b>determination</b> in neonates, infants and children with congenital cardiac defects, are necessary to test this hypothesis. The verification of sex-related intraoperative organ protection would provide new opportunities for preventing the uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that may occur during cardiac surgery.

40|$|Improvements in the {{sensitivity}} of the serum TSH assay have revolutionized our strategies for investigating thyroid function and firmly established TSH as the first-line thyroid function test for most clinical situations, including pregnancy. As a single <b>hormone</b> <b>determination,</b> serum TSH provides the most sensitive index to reliably detect thyroid function abnormalities. Normal thyroid function is important to ensure the best possible pregnancy outcome; in addition, disorders of the thyroid gland are relatively frequent in women of childbearing age. The aim of this article is, therefore, to present relevant information on analytical, as well as clinical, aspects regarding serum TSH determination and its usefulness to detect subtle thyroid function abnormalities associated with the pregnant state, namely overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. As these disorders are associated with poor pregnancy outcome, the authors of the present article are in favor of serum TSH measurement for all pregnant women. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We know comparatively little {{about the relationship between}} testosterone and life-history stages for non-seasonally breeding species.

First, we predict that testosterone profiles will track the reproductive profiles of each taxon across their respective breeding years. Second, we evaluate age-related changes in testosterone to determine whether several life-history transitions are associated with these changes. Subjects include males (> 2. 5  years) from wild populations of each taxon from whom we had fecal samples for <b>hormone</b> <b>determination.</b> Although testosterone profiles across taxa were broadly similar, considerable variability was found in the timing of two major changes: (1) the attainment of adult levels of testosterone and (2) the decline in testosterone after the period of maximum production. Attainment of adult testosterone levels was delayed by 1  year in chacmas compared with yellows and geladas. With respect to the decline in testosterone, geladas and chacmas exhibited a significant drop after 3  years of maximum production, while yellows declined so gradually that no significant annual drop was ever detected. For both yellows and chacmas, increases in testosterone production preceded elevations in social dominance rank.

Women received either 200 or 400 micrograms of thyrotropin-releasing hormone or were in the control group. RESULTS: Thyroid-stimulating <b>hormone</b> <b>determinations</b> on cord blood had a higher mean level in both treatment groups compared with the control group. No differences were seen in cord blood results between the two treatment groups for thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and prolactin levels. The only other differences found were in a higher level in total thyroxine and a lower level of free thyroxine in the 400 micrograms thyrotropin-releasing hormone group compared with the 200 micrograms group in the 48 -hour blood determinations. CONCLUSION: Both 200 and 400 micrograms of thyrotropin-releasing hormone provided fetal pituitary stimulation, as reflected in fetal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in cord blood, and both gave significantly higher levels compared with a control group.

40|$|In a short {{historical}} {{review of}} the outstanding changes occurred {{in the whole of}} endocrinology and particularly in Chile over the last 60 years -with the background of an infant mortality drop from 200 per thousand in 1940 to 8 per thousand today and a mean life expectancy increase from 42 to 76 years- the author outlines major achievements in this country. He comments on the use in former days of biological tests on urine extract to measure hormones for diagnostic procedures replaced by <b>hormone</b> <b>determinations</b> in blood by radioimmunoassays; today's medication with synthetic hormones instead of opotherapeutic preparations obtained from organ extracts; the identification of new hormones, receptors and new knowledge that enables us to understand the role of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, the interaction of neurological, endocrine and immunological systems and the involvement of stress in various diseases. Finally the description of DNA and the international cooperative project to establish the human genome map with unpredictable potential applications in medicine. The author underlines the importance of collaborative work in all branches of medicine, often making cooperation more effective than competition. The enormous expansion of biological information demands that direct application of scientific knowledge to clinical medicine is prevented as being insufficient for an optimal clinical judgment, since a bio-psychosociological perspective of the patient and the doctor's clinical experience are essential factors in the doctor-patient relationshi...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that parathyroid <b>hormone</b> (PTH) <b>determination</b> {{would be the}} most effective strategy to identify posttotal thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism (PTTHP) compared with other clinical and laboratory parameters. We retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with total thyroidectomy. We recorded demographics, malignancy, thyroid weight, parathyroid autotransplantation, hospital stay, use of postoperative calcium and hormonally active vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), and postoperative serum calcium and PTH levels. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether supplemental calcitriol was required to maintain eucalcemia and therefore reflecting the diagnosis of PTTHP. From October 2010 to June 2013, a total of 202 total thyroidectomies were performed. Twentyfour patients (12...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the pituitary-thyroid axis function during the long-term (30 days) intramuscular administration of 4 mg/day of thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T) in 15 patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. The study was performed as follows: (1) acute 4 mg TRH-T test with hourly prolactin (PRL) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level evaluations for 6 h; (2) placebo; and (3) 4 mg/day of TRH-T administration for 30 days with TSH, PRL, and free T 3 and T 4 (FT 3 and FT 4) levels evaluated on days 1, 15 and 30. <b>Hormone</b> <b>determination</b> was performed just before and 1 h after placebo or TRH-T administration. The acute administration of TRH-T caused a sustained rise of TSH which lasted until the 6 th hour and of PRL which declined after 1 h (p < 0. 01). During placebo administration, no change of TSH, PRL, FT 3 or FT 4 was observed. On the 1 st day of treatment, 1 h after the TRH-T injection, a significant increase of both TSH and PRL levels occurred (p < 0. 01). As compared to the 1 st day, a significant decrease of the TSH (p < 0. 01) levels occurred on the 15 th and 30 th days before TRH-T: the TSH response to TRH-T administration was present although less than on the 1 st day (p < 0. 01). Moreover, throughout the whole period of treatment, no difference was recorded for PRL levels before or after TRH-T administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify changes of the vaginal epithelium in Mexican hairless sows, which ovulated during lactation, caused by the effect of the boar presence and the litter withdrawal. In order to determine the oestrus stage, an exfoliative vaginal cytology and 17 b estradiol and progesterone determinations were carried out on the 8 day after the onset of lactation out accompanied with behaviour observations. Four groups of sows were used: Group 1 was not stimulated; Group 2, remained with the boar; Group 3 was separated from its litter for 4 h and Group 4 got both stimuli. Vaginal smear samples were collected every 24 h. for 5 days after stimulus. An ANOVA statistical analysis was performed for repetitive samples during the 5 days of the test. Stimuli used in group 4 caused significant modifications (P< 0 · 001) when compared to Groups 1, 2 y 3. Estradiol levels were higher than 30 pg/ml in Group 4 on day 10 post partum and 4. 5 ng/ml of progesterone on day 11 and 12 post partum. It was evident that 100 % of the sows in Groups 1, 2 and 3 did not show oestral activity when relating vaginal cytology with the oestral behaviour and <b>hormone</b> <b>determination</b> of the lactating sows, whereas 100 % of the sows in group 4 presented oestrus 72 h. after the stimulus and ovulated 24 to 36 h after the oestrus onset, this was corroborated by estradiol and progesterone determinations, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Justicia gendarussa or locally {{known as}} Gandarussa have been {{reported}} to contain naringenin and kaempferol that possess biological activities such as strong antioxidant and cytotoxicity. This paper present plant regeneration studies of J. gendarussa using different type of explants (young leaf and nodal segment) and media (B 5 or MS basal media) supplemented with different concentration of plant growth regulators. The results indicated a maximum of callus fresh weight gains was obtained (1. 21 g  0. 11) when young leaf explants were cultured on MS medium supplemented with Kn (3. 0 mgL - 1) + 2, 4 -D (1. 0 mgL - 1). For shoot induction, high percentage of shoot regeneration (100 %) and number of shoots produced per explants (5. 33  0. 33) was recorded when nodal explants were cultured on MSB 5 plates supplemented with 2. 0 mgL - 1 BAP. Then, the shooted explants were rooted in medium-free <b>hormone.</b> <b>Determination</b> of flavonoids (naringenin and kaempferol) content in methanolic organ extracts of in vitro plantlets was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector [GC-FID]. Green calli (701. 27 mgkg - 1 ± 7. 69) contained significant higher naringenin content than in vitro leaves (419. 99 mgkg - 1 ± 133. 39). However, {{there was no significant difference}} in kaempferol content between green calli (214. 19 mgkg - 1 ± 8. 28) and in vitro leaves (242. 03 mgkg - 1 ± 41. 13).

40|$|Hirudin, the anticoagulatory {{polypeptide}} of the leech Hirudo medicinalis, strongly inhibits thrombus formation by specifically {{interacting with}} thrombin. For diagnostic purposes, hirudin should {{be superior to}} other anticlotting compounds because it only minimally alters the mineral, protein, and cellular blood constituents. To test this hypothesis, hirudinized and routinely processed venous blood from 107 healthy volunteers and patients was subjected {{to a variety of}} mostly automated blood tests. Bland-Altman-Plots and a strong correlation showed a very good compliance between the results of the hirudinized blood and the respective standard substrat: automated complete blood counts obtained from K 2 -ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated and the 24 clinical chemistry parameters obtained from Serum. Different antibody determinations (anti-Hbs-antibody, HCV-antibody, CMV-antibody, HIV-antibody), virus detections (Hbs-antigen and HC-antigen) and <b>hormone</b> <b>determinations</b> (with the thyroid hormones TSH and TG) could be carried out with hirudinized blood well. Recombinant hirudin doesn´t alter the detection of Wilms' tumor gene expression by RT-PCR technology. Also electrophoresis and immunoglobulin detection could be executed with hirudinized blood reliably. The results of the clinical chemical examinations of deep-frozen blood samples showed the basic possibility to examine hirudinized plasma reliably even after lengthy professional storage. So the examinations showed the basic opportunity that a universal hirudin-containing blood sampling tube could be designed for automated analysis of haematological and clinical chemistry analytes as well as for a range of special parameter. Thus they establish a solid basis for multicenter studies to validate these results...|$|R
40|$|Background. Substantial {{data from}} animal studies have {{demonstrated}} a stimulatory effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on immune function. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of DHEA on the human immune system. Since aging is associated with a decline in immune function and in DHEA production, we proposed that oral administration of DHEA to elderly men would result in activation of their immune system. Methods. Nine healthy age-advanced men (mean age of 63 years) with low DHEA-sulfate levels participated in this study. They were treated nightly with an oral placebo for 2 weeks followed by DHEA (50 mg) for 20 weeks. Fasting (0800 h- 0900 h) blood samples were obtained at 4 - to 8 -week intervals for immune function studies and <b>hormone</b> <b>determinations.</b> Freshly isolated peripheral lymphocytes were used for flow cytometric identification of lymphocyte subsets, cells expressing the IL- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R), mitogen stimulation studies, and for determining natural killer (NK) cell number and cytotoxicity. Levels of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and IL- 6 secreted from cultured lymphocytes were determined under basal and mitogen stimulated conditions. Sera were analyzed for soluble IL- 2 Receptor (sIL- 2 R) levels, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) concentrations. Results. Baseline levels of serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), a stable marker of circulating DHEA levels, were 2 standard deviations below young adult values and increased 3 - 4 fold within 2 weeks. These levels were sustained throughout the duration of DHEA administration. When compared with placebo, DHEA administration resulted in a 20...|$|R
