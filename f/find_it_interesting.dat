5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting.</b> According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E

500|$|In a {{different}} video posted to YouTube, Anonymous addresses news organizations covering {{the conflict and}} criticizes media reporting of the incident. In the video, Anonymous criticizes the media specifically for not mentioning objections by the group to certain controversial aspects {{of the history of}} the Church of Scientology, and cited past incidents including the death of Lisa McPherson: [...] "We <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> that you did not mention the other objections in your news reporting. The stifling and punishment of dissent within the totalitarian organization of Scientology. The numerous, alleged human rights violations. Such as the treatment and events that led to the deaths of victims of the cult such as Lisa McPherson." [...] Lisa McPherson was a Scientologist who died in 1995 under controversial circumstances. Initially, the Church of Scientology was held responsible and faced felony charges in her death. The charges were later dropped and a civil suit brought by McPherson's family was settled in 2004. This second video was removed on January 25, 2008, YouTube citing a [...] "terms of use violation". Organizers of the February 10, 2008, Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology told the St. Petersburg Times the event was timed to coincide with the birthday of Lisa McPherson.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} end of the spectrum, Levy takes issue with women who make their way in a man's world by playing by men's rules. Sometimes, she argues, these women even make their fame and fortune by {{objectifying}} other women; for example, Levy <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> that the Playboy organization was run by a woman, Christie Hefner, Hugh Hefner's daughter. Levy addresses women who succeed in male-dominated fields on their own merit, but shy away from feminism, saying: [...] "But if you are the exception that proves the rule, and the rule is that women are inferior, you haven't made any progress." ...|$|R

5000|$|Economists {{commonly}} {{prefer to}} distinguish normative economics ("what ought to be" [...] in economic matters) from positive economics ("what is"). Many normative (value) judgments, however, are held conditionally, {{to be given}} up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific. On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that [...] "no judgments are demonstrably basic" [...] while some value judgments may {{be shown to be}} nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of value judgments.|$|R

He has also noted that hospitals {{have the right to}} develop and use ideas, {{as long as they do}} not sell them, and he would like to persuade the institutional review board to approve development in hospital use. In this way, doctors would do innovation first, and then companies could harness the benefits of such innovation. He has stressed that the number of consumers modifying products and thereby innovating outweighs the number of people doing this in companies.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Scogan paid no {{attention}} to his denial, but went on: [...] "Why will you young men continue to write about things that are so entirely uninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists? Professional anthropologists might <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> to turn sometimes from the beliefs of the Blackfellow to the philosophical preoccupations of the undergraduate. But you can't expect an ordinary adult man, like myself, to be much moved by the story of his spiritual troubles. And after all, even in England, even in Germany and Russia, there are more adults than adolescents. As for the artist, he is preoccupied with problems that are so utterly unlike those of the ordinary adult man--problems of pure aesthetics which don't so much as present themselves to people like myself--that a description of his mental processes is as boring to the ordinary reader as a piece of pure mathematics. A serious book about artists regarded as artists is unreadable; and a book about artists regarded as lovers, husbands, dipsomaniacs, heroes, and the like is really not worth writing again. Jean-Christophe is the stock artist of literature, just as Professor Radium of 'Comic Cuts' is its stock man of science." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is evident}} to any student {{of human nature}} that the critic who is obliged to sign his review will be more careful of an author's {{feelings}} than he would if he could intangibly and invisibly deal with him as the representative of a great journal. He will be loath to have his name connected with those perversions and misstatements of an author's meaning in which the critic now indulges without danger of being turned out of honest company. He will be in some degree forced {{to be fair and}} just with a book he dislikes; he will not wish to misrepresent it when his sin can be traced directly to him in person; he will not be willing to voice the prejudice of a journal which is [...] "opposed to the books" [...] of this or that author; and the journal itself, when it is no longer responsible for the behavior of its critic, may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> and profitable to give to an author his innings when he feels wronged by a reviewer and desires to right himself; it may even be eager to offer him the opportunity. We shall then, perhaps, frequently witness the spectacle of authors turning upon their reviewers, and improving their manners and morals by confronting them in public with the errors they may now commit with impunity. Many an author smarts under injuries and indignities which he might resent to the advantage of literature and civilization, if he were not afraid of being browbeaten by the journal whose nameless critic has outraged him.|$|E

There were forty snowfalls between Thanksgiving and Fast Day--you don't know what Fast Day is in New York, and we didn't, either, as far as the fasting went--and the cold kept on and on till we couldn't, or said we couldn't, stand it any longer. So, along about the middle of March somewhere, we picked up the {{children}} and started south. In those days New York seemed pretty far south to us; and when we got here we found everything on wheels that we had left on runners in Boston. But the next day it began to snow, and we said we must go a little farther to meet the spring. I don't know exactly what it was made us pitch on Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; but we had a notion we should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>interesting,</b> and, at any rate, a total change from our old environment. We had been reading something about the Moravians, and we knew that it was the capital of Moravianism, with the largest Moravian congregation in the world; I think it was Longfellow's 'Hymn of the Moravian Nuns' that set us to reading about the sect; and we had somehow heard that the Sun Inn, at Bethlehem, was the finest old-fashioned public house anywhere. At any rate, we had the faith of our youthful years, and we put out for Bethlehem.|$|E
5000|$|The philosopher Douglas Kellner writes that, like Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus (1972), Libidinal Economy {{is a key}} text in the micropolitics of desire.

It {{has been suggested that}} Libidinal Economy is Lyotard's most important early work available in English translation; as of 1993, it was generating increasing interest among critics who have given attention to the work Lyotard produced before becoming interested in postmodernism. Libidinal Economy has also been compared to philosopher Jacques Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967), Luce Irigaray's Speculum of the Other Woman (1974), and Baudrillard's Symbolic Exchange and Death (1976), with which it forms part of post-structuralism, a response to the demise of structuralism as a dominant intellectual discourse.|$|R
