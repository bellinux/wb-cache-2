5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint</b> to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
500|$|The title design, {{that was}} awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest, {{was made by}} Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill {{production}} studio. Kijak's requirement was to [...] "blow people off their seats". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he [...] "was very taken by their [...] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already so mad and so creative". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song [...] "Jade" [...] {{the way that the}} images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint</b> in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E
2500|$|Kesey's role as {{a medical}} guinea pig, {{as well as his}} stint working at the Veterans' Administration hospital, {{inspired}} him to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The success of this book, as well as the demolition of the Perry Lane cabins in August 1963, allowed him to move to a log house at 7940 La Honda Road in La Honda, California, a rustic hamlet in the Santa Cruz Mountains fifteen miles {{to the west of the}} Stanford University campus. He frequently entertained friends and many others with parties he called [...] "Acid Tests," [...] involving music (including the Stanford-educated Anonymous Artists of America and Kesey's favorite band, the Grateful Dead), black lights, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint,</b> strobe lights, LSD, and other psychedelic effects. These parties were described in some of Ginsberg's poems and served as the basis for Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, an early exemplar of the nonfiction novel. Other firsthand accounts of the Acid Tests appear in [...] by Hunter S. Thompson and the 1967 Hell's Angels memoir Freewheelin Frank, Secretary of the Hell's Angels (Frank Reynolds; ghostwritten by Michael McClure).|$|E

The reconstructions were simulated using a “virtual ” camera and also an image-based reconstruction was performed. The performance of the system was highly dependent upon the sharp short– wavelength cutoff filters. The purpose of these filters was reducing the amount of luminescence emerging from a fluorescent sample. The fluorescence imaging system was also highly dependent upon the calibration target. The project was divided into four stages: Stage I: Preparing a series of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paints</b> and measuring with a commercial bi-spectrometer, Stage II: Simulated spectral fluorescence imaging based on two different abridged spectral methods, Stage III: Imaging system construction and testing, Stage IV: UV Fluorescence imaging...|$|R

50|$|Brothers Robert and Joseph Switzer of Berkeley, California, began {{investigating}} fluorescence in the 1930s using a {{black light}} to identify naturally occurring fluorescent compounds.

50|$|During World War II, DayGlo {{products}} were extensively {{used by the}} U.S. military in applications where visibility was required. U.S. ground troops in North Africa identified themselves using daylight fluorescent fabric panels to prevent friendly fire bombings by pilots, and DayGlo paints were used on aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. Navy air carriers used DayGlo's black light <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paints</b> to allow planes to land at night, an advantage that enemy pilots did not have. Military equipment manufacturers, particularly those of aircraft parts, employed DayGlo's Zyglo and Magnaglo processes to identify defects in metal fabricated parts.After the war, daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paints</b> were used by advertisers to make their products more visible to consumers. Tide detergent became known for its fluorescent packaging beginning in 1959, but other products such as clothing, posters and hula hoops also used daylight fluorescent colors. Daylight fluorescent pigments were also used across safety applications such as construction cones, street signs and safety vests, due to their high visibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{brothers}} {{established the}} Fluor-S-Art Co. in 1934 {{to develop and}} sell black light paints for advertising purposes. The company later partnered with Continental Lithograph (a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures) of Cleveland, Ohio, to develop <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paints</b> for use in movie posters and advertising displays. In 1936, the brothers moved their company to Cleveland, which was a center of the paint manufacturing industry.|$|R
5000|$|Goa {{parties have}} a {{definitive}} visual aspect - {{the use of}} [...] "fluoro" [...] (<b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint)</b> is common on clothing and on decorations such as tapestries. The graphics on these decorations are usually associated with topics such as aliens, Hinduism, other religious (especially eastern) images, mushrooms (and other psychedelic art), shamanism and technology. Shrines {{in front of the}} DJ stands featuring religious items are also common decorations.|$|E
50|$|Quinze's artwork {{is mainly}} {{referring}} to social interaction, evolution, communication, rhythm, {{the interplay of}} lines, contrasts and contradictions. Recurring techniques in his work are multiple types of wood, including salvaged wood; cardboard, polyurethane and electrical colors in <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint.</b> Because of their intense orange-red color the sculptures contrast with their natural surroundings and generate the sentiment of estrangement. People are completely absorbed by the orange initiating astonished reactions.|$|E
50|$|The Day-Glo Color Corp. (DayGlo) is an American, {{privately held}} paint and {{pigments}} manufacturer based in Cleveland, Ohio. It {{was founded in}} 1946 by brothers Joseph and Robert Switzer and is currently owned by RPM International. DayGlo specializes in producing <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint</b> and pigments, such as those used in safety applications, artwork and signage.

The emitted light and the reflected light combine and may be considerably more visible than the original light.

50|$|Acrylic {{paintings}} allowed Katzen to make {{a transition}} into sculpture. She experimented with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paints</b> and backlights, using light as a medium in itself. In The Pressure Light, Katzen discovered that light was more complex when it could interact with the environment. This led to her exploration of the duality of light as it is confined within the boundary of the piece and simultaneously exists beyond its boundaries, including the spectator in the art itself.|$|R
50|$|The Welrod was {{provided}} with sights marked with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint</b> {{for use in}} low light conditions. Although it had a maximum suggested range of 25 yards (22.86 meters) it was intended for use far closer - up to point-blank range.

5000|$|Robert C. Switzer, usually {{known as}} Bob Switzer, (19 May 1914 [...] - [...] 20 August 1997) was an American inventor, {{businessman}} and environmentalist.

50|$|Black Light or Luminous Paint is {{typically}} {{made up of}} fluorescent dyes mixed into paint. These dyes are not a typical dye, but rather a pigment that is suspended in a carrier or resin. This pigment is what gives off a glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. This glow or light is created by the energy that is released from the pigment. While the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>paint</b> layers reflect light, the paint layer darkens over time and decreases in fluorescence.|$|E
