5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side.</b> The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side,</b> and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their <b>dorsal</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> {{of the body is}} a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
5000|$|Fountainea nobilis is a quite rare [...] "leaf butterfly". The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the upperwings are reddish {{with dark}} brown edges. In the females the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> are usually brown, with clearer edges. On the hindwings {{there are a}} few small white and black eyespots. The undersides mimic dead leaves, ranging from pale brown to grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{iridescent}} lamellae {{are only}} {{present on the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.|$|R
5000|$|Cethosia biblis is {{medium-sized}} butterfly, with a wingspan reaching about 8 - 9 cm. In {{this species}} the sexes are dimorphic. In males the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings are bright orange red, {{framed by a}} black outline with white spots. The undersides range from bright red to pale brown, interlaced by black and white. This astonishing pattern helps to disguise {{the shape of the}} butterfly, while the intense colour of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings is a warning to predators that the red lacewing has a bad taste, deriving from the poisonous host plants of the caterpillars. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings of the females are greyish-brownish with black spots and white bands and spots on the black margins.|$|R
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
50|$|Rhodometra sacraria has a {{wingspan}} reaching 22-28 mm, {{while the}} length of the forewings is 12-14 mm. These moths are easily distinguishable from the mahogany or pink stripe, located on yellowish or cream background, crossing diagonally the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the upperwings up to the apex. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the hind wings are whitish and unmarked. The intensity and the extent of the pink pigmentation is rather variable, depending on the seasonal temperature {{in the development of the}} pupae.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Leaves of R. minus {{showing the}} phyllotaxis. The leaves have their ventral sides {{up on the}} left and <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> up on the right.|$|R
5000|$|Dorsoradial {{ligament}} (DRL): Like {{the previous}} ligament, the DRL {{is not considered}} important to the first CMC. It connects the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the trapezium and the first metacarpal.|$|R
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} torrent salamanders {{are small}} salamanders; mature adults measure from 1.5-2.4 inches snout to vent. On their <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides,</b> they are brown with darker spots. Their ventral sides are more yellow, {{with the same}} spots as the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides.</b> The colors vary by shades, but also the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> range from dark olive to a dark brown. Their eyes face forwards and are large and dark. Metallic flecks surround the eyes, as well. Males are distinguished from the females by their square cloacal lobes. Lungs of the adults are also reduced in appearance. Their bodies are slender, with long tails about the same length as their torsos. They have four legs, set in pairs - two close to the head, and two near {{the base of the}} tail. At the base of the leg, they have four toes used to grip and climb. Generally, they have blunt noses and protruding eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Dorsoradial {{ligament}} (DRL): Like {{the previous}} ligament, the DRL {{is not considered}} important to the first CMC. [...] It connects the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the trapezium and the first metacarpal.|$|R
40|$|Labiosthenolepis andamanensis sp. nov. is {{described}} from the Andaman Sea, southwestern Thailand, and from Tanabe Bay, Japan. The {{bulk of the}} samples were collected from the Andaman Sea during the ‘Effects of Offshore Tin Mining Project’ in 1980 - 1982. Labiosthenolepis andamanensis differs from L. laevis (McIntosh, 1885) by having oval, thin, flattened labial lobes and stylodes on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of segment 1, whereas in the latter species the labial lobes are thick, fleshy, lobulate, without stylodes on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of segment 1. The new species also differs from L. sibogae (Horst, 1917) by having dorsal tubercles on segment 3, which are absent in the latter species...|$|R
25|$|Their uropatagium {{is almost}} {{completely}} furred across the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side,</b> but about half furred on its ventral side.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side,</b> {{two long}} {{extrinsic}} extensor muscles are superficial to the intrinsic muscles, and their tendons form the dorsal aponeurosis of the toes. The short intrinsic extensors and the plantar and dorsal interossei radiates into these aponeuroses.|$|E
25|$|The other {{characteristics}} do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins {{between the eyes}} and continues down the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the Asian tiger mosquito.|$|E
50|$|In Morpho achilles, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the {{forewings}} are black, {{with two}} broad vertical bands of brilliant blue. The undersides of the hindwings are olive brownish, with several ocelli formed by blue, yellow, red and red concentric rings.|$|R
5000|$|Parides iphidamas has a {{wingspan}} {{of about}} 10 cm. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the forewings are black, {{with a broad}} green and white spots (completely white in females), while the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the hindwings show a broad red band or spot. Along the edges there are many small yellow spots. The undersides of the wings are black with a white band on the forewings and several pink patches on the hindwings. [...] The body of the butterfly is black with red dots. The poisonous caterpillars are chocolate brown, with white or brown protrusions resembling thorns. The host plants are various toxic Aristolochia species (A. cordiflora, A. maxima, A. odoratissma, A. pilosa, A. ringens, and A. tonduzii).|$|R
50|$|Animals {{within this}} family have {{elongated}} bodies with numerous branching cerata on their <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides.</b> The cerata lack extensions from the digestive gland. The head has an oral veil having branching extensions. The lamellate rhinophores {{are surrounded by}} a sheath and branched extensions.|$|R
25|$|The triangulate cobweb spider (scientific name: Steatoda triangulosa; {{also called}} the triangulate bud spider) is a common house spider in the genus Steatoda. As the name indicates, {{it is well known}} for the triangle-shaped pattern on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of its abdomen.|$|E
25|$|A related species, {{commonly}} found in North America, is Steatoda borealis. This spider is similar to S. grossa in shape, but slightly smaller, and is generally found in colder climates. This spider can be identified by colored markings on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of its abdomen {{rather than on the}} ventral side.|$|E
25|$|Ecdysis—this {{begins with}} the {{splitting}} of the old cuticle, usually starting in the midline of the thorax’s <b>dorsal</b> <b>side.</b> The rupturing force is mostly from haemolymph pressure that has been forced into thorax by abdominal muscle contractions caused by the insect swallowing air or water. After this the insect wriggles {{out of the old}} cuticle.|$|E
50|$|Mimoides protodamas has a {{wingspan}} reaching 70 - 80 mm. It {{is a black}} butterfly with rounded apex and concave {{outer edge}} of the forewings, while the {{outer edge of the}} hindwings is scalloped. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings shows a series of whitish-bluish markings.|$|R
50|$|Caligo illioneus has a {{wingspan}} reaching about 12 - 15 cm. In {{this large}} owl butterfly the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings vary from light brilliant blue to purplish with dark brown edges, while the undersides have a highly cryptic dull brown color, with huge yellow-rimmed eyespots resembling {{to the eyes}} of an owl.|$|R
50|$|Vanessa virginiensis is {{most easily}} {{distinguishable}} by its two large eyespots on the ventral side, whereas V. cardui has four small eyespots and V. annabella has none. V. virginiensis also uniquely features a white dot within the forewing subapical field, set in pink {{on the underside}} and usually also in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side's</b> orange field.|$|R
25|$|Callosities on the ischium {{imply that}} these animals {{would sit on}} their {{haunches}} for extended periods of time, probably while feeding. Pad-supporting bony growth on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> of the manual phalanges is interpreted as evidence of knuckle-walking, which would probably be useful to avoid wearing down the claws, preserving them for use either as a forage-collecting rake or as a formidable defensive weapon.|$|E
25|$|Their {{bodies are}} {{elongate}} and sleek, {{typical of the}} catshark family. Their <b>dorsal</b> <b>side</b> is a dark reddish brown with dark saddle patterns on their side. Their ventral sides are a creamy white with reddish spots. Redspotted catsharks have two dorsal fins, with the first dorsal axil over the pelvic region. Their dorsal fins do not have spines, and their tails have no upward bend.|$|E
25|$|Species such as T. eurycephalus however had {{a shorter}} rostrum and a deeper skull. This build of skull {{seems to have}} been made for {{crushing}} prey. T. platyodon had a very long snout which is slightly curved on its <b>dorsal</b> <b>side.</b> The species T. trigadon’s snout is also very long but can be ventrally curved. T. acutirostris’ snout is slender with a more pointed tip.|$|E
50|$|Eryphanis automedon has a {{wingspan}} reaching {{about 55}} - 60 mm. In males the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings show night blue iridescent patches, extending from submedial to postmedial areas, with well defined borders separating the non-iridescent sections. Ventral sides vary from faded brown to caramel color, with various eyespots. The female wingspan is slightly larger, {{with a slightly}} different wing color pattern.|$|R
50|$|African linsangs {{are white}} or cream in color on their ventral <b>side,</b> while the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> have dark {{circular}} marks. Sometimes {{an individual can}} have a black thin stripe that runs from the nose {{to the root of}} the tail. Its tail holds 10 to 14 rings which differ in measurement. The soles of the linsang's feet are covered with hair.|$|R
50|$|Papilio palinurus has a {{wingspan}} reaching about 8 - 10 cm. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>sides</b> of {{the wings}} {{are covered by}} a powder of green scales and the background vary from dark greenish to black, with broad bright emerald green metallic bands. The undersides are black with orange, white and blue spots {{along the edges of}} hindwings, that show extended tails at the end.|$|R
