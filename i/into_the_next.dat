5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} at Johns Hopkins {{continued to grow}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin. After {{the election}} results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election. On February 1, 2006, the Liberal Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at the Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2–3, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Dyer {{took his}} role as a {{physical}} culture expert very seriously and insisted on managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the District Court, Higginbotham developed a relationship with President Johnson, attending various White House functions and conferences in the mid-1960s. The day after Martin Luther King was assassinated, Higginbotham was called to the White House {{to take part in}} a series of meetings to advise the President on how to respond to King's death. Other notable figures at the meeting were Vice President Humphrey, Justice Marshall, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Andrew Brimmer, Clarence Mitchell, Clifford Alexander, and Bayard Rustin. Higginbotham stayed the night at the White House, attended a service at the Washington National Cathedral, and continued to advise the President <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> days.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, {{playing a}} number of new songs.

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Since the cars of Manor Marussia failed to start, only three drivers were eliminated during the first session of qualifying (Q1), all of which was run in dry conditions. The McLaren cars of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen struggled as expected, following their lack of pre-season testing and failed to make it into Q2, just as Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson. Mercedes and Williams' Valtteri Bottas were the only ones not having to use the softer tyres to proceed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> part of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the House and Senate quickly and was made law on March 19, 1816. But, the measure proved {{extremely}} unpopular with voters, {{in part because}} it applied to the current Congress. Many legislators who supported the bill lost their congressional seats as a result, including Johnson's colleague Solomon P. Sharp from Kentucky. Johnson's popularity in other matters helped him retain his seat. Two days <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> session, he recanted his support for the law. It was repealed in that session, and in its place, legislators passed an increase in the per diem salary.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{partially}} fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren. In 1961, Hitchcock notices Hedren in a television commercial for a diet drink. He wants to turn her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Grace Kelly, with whom he had worked extensively during the 1950s. Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock's latest film, The Birds; the director instructs her about her dress and appearance.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{follows the}} {{railroad}} tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY456, comes to its western end. After crossing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> town, Chazy, NY22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY191, in the hamlet of Sciota.|$|E
5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals. During these rituals, {{the soul of}} a dying or deceased individual is given safe passage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> life. This ritual {{is directly related to the}} economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} {{he attended}} {{in his early}} life {{were a part of}} a movement in the study of botany by artisans. This had been initiated by George Caley, James Crowther, John Dewhurst, John Mellor and Edward Hobson, the last of whom Horsefield met in 1809 at a meeting held at Radcliffe Bridge and whose knowledge he held in high regard. It was part of a broader working class movement involving the study of nature and natural history that developed in the late 18th century and continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{higher layer}} of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E
