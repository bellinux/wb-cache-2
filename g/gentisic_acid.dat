When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E

The main aim of presented {{study was the}} quantitative and qualitative analysis (LC-ESI-MS/MS) of phenolic acids and flavonoids present in extracts obtained from corn snacks with addition of elderberry fruits or flowers. Additionally, antiradical activity of samples was determined. Moreover, the comparison of various extraction methods of polyphenols from that functional food was made. In corn snacks, without additives, nine phenolic compounds were identified. These were protocatechuic, 4 -OH-benzoic, caffeic, p-coumaric, salicylic, ferulic acids, rutin, isoquercetin and apigenin- 7 -glucoside. In the extract from Sambucus flowers and extract from snacks containing 20 % of Sambucus flowers fifteen polyphenols were found. They were additionally gallic, <b>gentisic,</b> vanillic, sinapic <b>acids,</b> kaempferol- 3 -rutinoside and astragalin. The radical-scavenging activity of the extracts was determined spectrophotometrically against DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical and using thin layer chromatography. The high antiradical potential was observed for crude extracts from Sambucus flowers or fruits and for extracts enriched with 20 %, 10 %, 5 % of Sambucus flowers.

40|$|Seven millet {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Sri Lanka (proso, foxtail, finger (Ravi), finger (local), kodo, and little) and India (pearl) {{were used in}} this study. Soluble and bound phenolics obtained by solvent extraction were used to evaluate antioxidant, DNA scission and enzyme inhibitory and antiproliferative activities by several chemical and biological methods. Distribution of phenolics and their antioxidant activity was assessed in dehulled grains and hulls separated by air classification. Phenolic compounds in free, soluble conjugates and insoluble bound fractions were identified and quantified. In addition, accessibility of phenolics in the digestive tract was determined using a simulated in vitro digestion model and colonic fermentation. The contents of total phenolics (TPC),total flavonoids (TFC) and proanthocyanidins (PC) as well as scavenging activities of test compounds were evaluated using superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, 2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, H₂O₂, and singlet oxygen. Different concentrations of extract {{were used to determine}} their IC₅₀ values. In addition, the ferrous chelating and reducing activities of extracts were measured. The highest phenolic content of soluble phenolics of millet grains was obtained with 70 % (v/v) acetone for 25 minutes under reflux conditions. The TPC of soluble and insoluble bound phenolic fractions of millet varieties were 7. 2 - 32. 4 and 2. 2 - 81. 6 μmol ferulic acid eq/g defatted meal, respectively. This demonstrates that bound phenolics are important contributors to antioxidant potential of millets. Kodo millet showed the highest soluble phenolic content followed by finger (local), finger (Ravi), little, foxtail, pearl and proso millets. Millets with dark brown pigmented testa and pericarp possessed a higher soluble phenolic content than those with white or yellow testa and pericarp. The TFC of soluble and insoluble extracts were 1. 2 - 33. 7 and 0. 3 - 4. 5 μmol catechin eq (CE) /g defatted meal, respectively. The soluble extracts of finger (local) millet had the highest PC (311. 28 μmol CE/g defatted meal). All varieties exhibited effective radical, H₂O₂ and singlet oxygen inhibition, reducing activity as well as ferrous ion chelating power which varied according to the assay employed and the variety used. Several hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis. In general, ferulic and ρ-coumaric were found to be the major phenolic acids followed by protocatechuic, caffeic, sinapic, ρ-hydroxybenzoic, <b>gentisic,</b> and vanillic <b>acids</b> and their contents depended on the variety and the form present in the grain matrix. Flavonoids identified were flavones, flavan- 3 -ol monomers and dimers, and flavanonols. All seven varieties effectively inhibited oxidation in a pork model system, and stripped corn oil. At a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml all extracts inhibited oxidation by 16 - 88 % in the linoleic acid emulsion system. All phenolic extracts inhibited Cu (II) -induced human LDL and liposome oxidation and DNA scission. Millet extracts at 0. 05 mg/mL inhibited LDL cholesterol oxidation by 1 - 41 % and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA scission. The antiprolifeative studies showed that kodo millet extract inhibited HT- 29 cells proliferation in the range of 75 - 100 % after 4 days of incubation. The hulls from dehulled millets had higher TPC and antioxidant activity compared to their whole, dehulled and cooked grain counterparts. The phenolic extracts of dehulled millet grains, following in vitro enzymic digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and colonic fermentation, showed effective antioxidant activity and were accessible under physiological conditions...|$|R

The combinations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid,</b> ferulic acid, gallic acid, and coumaric acid in a random order for their effects on PSTs activities were evaluated at concentrations of 2. 5, 5. 0, and 7. 5 muM. The PST-M activity was significantly increased when <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid</b> was combined with each of the other phenolic acids. When p-hydroxybenzoic acid was combined with each of the other phenolic acids, a synergistic effect with respect to the promotion of PST-P activity was obtained. A potential synergistic effect for the PST-P activity was also found in the following combination: p-hydroxybenzoic acid + gallic acid + <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid,</b> p-hydroxybenzoic acid + gallic acid + m-coumaric acid, P-hydroxybenzoic acid + o-coumaric acid + p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid + o-coumaric acid + m-coumaric acid, gallic acid + <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid</b> + p-coumaric acid, and gallic acid + o-coumaric acid + m-coumaric acid. Therefore, the activities of both forms of PSTs can be promoted by all of these combinations of phenolic acids. These results provide a better understanding regarding the effect of phenolic acids on human PSTs activities, as well as more information on the intake of antioxidant phenolic acids for human health...|$|E

40|$|Four thermotolerant {{actinomycetes}} from soil, {{identified as}} Streptomyces albulus 321, Streptomyces sioyaensis P 5, Streptomyces viridosporus T 7 A, and Streptomyces sp. V 7, were grown at 45 °C in media containing either benzoic acid or hydroxyl- and methoxyl-substituted benzoic acids {{as the principal}} carbon sources. Benzoic acid was converted to catechol; p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and veratric acids were converted to protocatechuic acid; and m-hydroxybenzoic acid was converted to <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid.</b> Catechol, protocatechuic acid, and <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid</b> were cleaved by catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3, 4 -dioxygenase, and gentisate 1, 2 -dioxygenase, respectively. Dioxygenases appeared only in induced cultures. m-Hydroxybenzoic, m-anisic, and p-anisic acids were gratuitous inducers of dioxygenases in some strains. One strain converted vanillic acid to guaiacol...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various flavonoids, lectins and phenyl β-d-glucoside on larval survival, weights and the {{activities}} of digestive (total serine protease and trypsin) and detoxifying [esterase and glutathione-S-transferase] enzymes of Helicoverpa armigera larvae at 5 and 10 days after treatment (DAT) was studied through diet incorporation assay. Flavonoids (quercetin, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, trihydroxyflavone, <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid,</b> ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid and umbelliferone) were incorporated in artificial diet at 100, 500 and 1000 ppm, lectins: groundnut leaf lectin (GLL), concavalin (ConA) and phenyl β-d-glucoside at 2. 5 and 5 μg mL− 1. Flavonoids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and protocatechuic acid at 1, 000 ppm were more toxic to H. armigera larvae at 10 DAT than quercetin, catechin, cinnamic acid, trihydroxyflavone, <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid,</b> ferulic acid and umbelliferone. Larval growth and development were significantly reduced in H. armigera larvae fed on a diet with GLL and ConA at 5 μg mL− 1 compared to the larvae fed at 2. 5 and 1. 25 μg mL− 1 concentrations. The enzyme activities of the larvae were significantly reduced in flavonoid-treated diets. The flavonoids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, <b>gentisic</b> <b>acid,</b> trihydroxyflavone, catechin and protocatechuic acid, and lectins, GLL and ConA can be utilized in insect control programs...|$|E
