500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Aruban police {{subsequently}} {{provided a}} fuller {{version of the}} relevant part of the tape in which Kalpoe's response differed from the Dr. Phil version, apparently due to editing that may have altered the meaning of what was said. An unofficial Aruban-affiliated spokesperson and commentator on the case said that the uncut videotape showed that Kalpoe had shaken <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No, she didn't.", thereby denying that Holloway had sex with him {{and the other two}} men. According to an MSNBC report, the crucial words are inaudible, and presenter Rita Cosby questioned if it could be substantiated that Kalpoe had ever made the statements attributed to him in the Dr. Phil version of the recording.|$|E
500|$|Tubman {{also carried}} a revolver, {{and was not}} afraid to use it. The gun afforded some {{protection}} from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs; however, she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten {{the safety of the}} remaining group. Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted {{he was going to go}} back to the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves. She pointed the gun at <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You go on or die." [...] Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.|$|E
60|$|He let go o' Kumbo's arm, turned round twice, {{and then}} sat down 'eavy and fell fast asleep. The manager rushed {{to the door and}} looked out, but there was no signs of the boy, and he came back shaking <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that George 'ad been {{drinking}} agin.|$|R
6000|$|... "The boy pointed, and {{the skipper}} {{stood up in}} the boat and felt round with a boat-hook. Twice 'e said he thought 'e touched something, {{but it turned out}} as 'e was mistaken. His face got longer and longer <b>and</b> 'e shook <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he was afraid it was no good.|$|R
60|$|It was Psmith's guiding rule in life {{never to}} be {{surprised}} at anything, so he merely inclined <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gracefully, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E
2500|$|Judson, {{instead of}} {{welcoming}} {{him to the}} faith, pressed him further asking if he believed what he had read in the gospel of Matthew that Jesus the son of God died on the cross. U Shwe Ngong shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ah, you have caught me now. I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross." [...] Not long after, {{he came back to}} tell Judson, [...] "I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…. I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo Bill {{would not}} discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He just shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was too bad to talk about. While Cody did not {{participate}} in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair. The engagement, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E
6000|$|He shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gravely <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I cannot tell," [...] but {{he could}} not keep his manner from betraying that he {{expected}} the worst.|$|R
6000|$|I {{quite believe}} that Mr. Micawber saw himself, in his {{judicial}} mind's eye, on the woolsack. He passed his hand complacently over <b>his</b> bald <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with ostentatious resignation: ...|$|R
6000|$|Mahtawa raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> {{pointing}} to the silver rifle, [...] "Mahtawa wishes to have the two-shotted medicine gun. He will give his best horse in exchange." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Mishnah recounted a {{story that}} {{demonstrated}} {{the authority of the}} court in [...] — that one must follow the rulings of the court and [...] "not turn [...] [...] [...] to the right hand, nor to the left." [...] After two witnesses testified that they saw the new moon at its proper time (on the thirtieth day of the month shortly before nightfall), Rabban Gamaliel (the president of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem) accepted their evidence and ruled that a new month had begun. But later at night (after the nightfall with which the thirty-first day of the earlier month would have begun), when the new moon should have been clearly visible, no one saw the new moon. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declared the two witnesses to be false witnesses, comparing their testimony to that of witnesses who testify that a woman bore a child, when on the next day her belly was still swollen. Rabbi Joshua told Rabbi Dosa that he saw the force of his argument. Rabban Gamaliel then ordered Rabbi Joshua to appear before Rabban Gamaliel with his staff and money on the day which according to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning would be Yom Kippur. (According to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning, Yom Kippur would fall a day after the date that it would fall according to Rabban Gamaliel's reckoning. And [...] prohibited carrying a staff and money on Yom Kippur.) Rabbi Akiva then found Rabbi Joshua in great distress (agonizing over whether to obey Rabban Gamaliel's order to do what Rabbi Joshua considered profaning Yom Kippur). Rabbi Akiva told Rabbi Joshua that he could prove that whatever Rabban Gamaliel ordered was valid. Rabbi Akiva cited [...] which says, [...] "These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons," [...] {{which is to say that}} whether they are proclaimed at their proper time or not, God has no appointed seasons other than those that are proclaimed. Rabbi Joshua then went to Rabbi Dosa, who told Rabbi Joshua that if they called into question the decisions of the court of Rabban Gamaliel, then they would have to call into question the decisions of every court since the days of Moses. For [...] says, [...] "Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel went up," [...] and [...] does not mention the names of the elders to show that every group of three that has acted as a court over Israel is on a level with the court of Moses (as most of the members of that court also bore names without distinction). Rabbi Joshua then took his staff and his money and went to Rabban Gamaliel on the day that Rabbi Joshua reckoned was Yom Kippur. Rabban Gamaliel rose and kissed Rabbi Joshua on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Come in peace, my teacher and my disciple — my teacher in wisdom and my disciple because you have accepted my decision."–25a2.|$|E

60|$|And he sobbed {{again and}} said: 'Mother, my {{suffering}} {{is greater than}} I can bear. Give me thy forgiveness, and {{let me go back}} to the forest.'

6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{and then}} one of the gun {{bullocks}} lifted up <b>his</b> big <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of fighting." ...|$|R
6000|$|It’s {{wonderful}} wot {{a uniform}} will do. The policeman just jerked <b>his</b> <b>’ead</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "out-side," [...] {{and the men}} went out like a flock of sheep. The on’y man that said a word was the carman, who {{was in such a}} hurry that ’e knocked his bad shin against my foot as ’e went by. The thin little woman was passed out by the policeman {{in the middle of a}} speech she was making, and he was just going for the other, when the skipper stopped ’im.|$|R
