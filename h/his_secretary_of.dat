5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days.

5|$|Harding chose pro-League Charles Evans Hughes as <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, {{ignoring}} {{advice from}} Senator Lodge and others. After Charles G. Dawes declined the Treasury position, Harding asked Pittsburgh banker Andrew W. Mellon, {{one of the}} richest men in the country; he agreed. Harding appointed Herbert Hoover as United States Secretary of Commerce. RNC Chairman Will Hays was made Postmaster General, then a cabinet post; he would leave after a year in the position to become chief censor to the motion picture industry.|$|E
5|$|Taft and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Miller became {{increasingly}} defensive as well. He added security at union headquarters, {{and demanded that}} all staff travel plans be cleared through him so he could detect plotting.

5|$|Taft {{remained}} {{involved in}} Philippine affairs. During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904, he urged that Philippine agricultural products {{be admitted to}} the U.S. without duty. This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt, who remonstrated with <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War. Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position, and threatened to resign; Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter. Taft returned to the islands in 1905, leading a delegation of congressmen, and again in 1907, to open the first Philippine Assembly.|$|E
5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Commerce, Charles W. Sawyer, {{to take control of}} a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E

5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Jimmy Carter {{became the}} first Democratic {{president}} to use a Saxbe fix when he appointed Senator Edmund Muskie as <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State. Cyrus Vance had resigned on April 28, 1980. (Ironically, Muskie {{had been one of}} the ten senators voting against Saxbe's confirmation.) Carter nominated Muskie on April 29, and the Senate confirmed Muskie on May 7 by a 94–2 vote. Unlike the Knox and Saxbe fixes, the salary reduction to allow Muskie's appointment was temporary, reducing the salary only for the duration of Muskie's tenure. When Carter appointed Representative Abner Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, a lawsuit challenging the appointment based on Ineligibility Clause objections again failed for lack of standing.|$|E
5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{organized}} Congolese troops, {{known as}} the , were created in 1888 when King Leopold II of Belgium, who held the Congo Free State as his private property, ordered <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior to create military and police forces for the state. In 1908, under international pressure, Leopold ceded administration of the colony {{to the government of}} Belgium as the Belgian Congo. It remained under the command of a Belgian officer corps through to the independence of the colony in 1960. The Force Publique saw combat in Cameroun, and successfully invaded and conquered areas of German East Africa, notably present day Rwanda, during World War I. Elements of the Force Publique were also used to form Belgian colonial units that fought in the East African Campaign during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, <b>his</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E
5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in the House {{for the remainder of the}} session.|$|E
