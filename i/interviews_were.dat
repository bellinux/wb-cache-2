The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded.

It occurs when the immigration officer conducting the adjustment of status interview suspects that a couple's marital status is fraudulent. The Stokes <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> offered as a second chance for the couple to prove their marriage's legitimacy. What separates the Stokes interview from the initial adjustment of status <b>interview,</b> which <b>is</b> usually the only interview necessary in the process, is that during the Stokes <b>interview</b> couples <b>are</b> <b>interviewed</b> separately instead of together.

50|$|In general {{clinical}} practice with assessment of personality disorders, {{one form of}} <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> the most popular; an unstructured interview.

With the telephone interview {{there may not be}} direct contact between the employer and employee, however, the expectations are still there. Telephone <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> scheduled and questions are generally prepared in advance, similar to the way other <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> conducted. Another common reason a company looks to the telephone <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> that these <b>interviews</b> can <b>be</b> conducted on-the-fly.
