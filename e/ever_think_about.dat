5000|$|Billboard {{reviewed}} the song favorably. [...] "In the lyric, Pickler reflects on missed moments (braiding hair, {{getting ready for}} prom) and wonders if her mother <b>ever</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> her. The most powerful music is that which draws from real life, and this is heartbreakingly honest and vulnerable. Yet among the hurt and confusion, Pickler emerges as a survivor. Country music at its finest {{from one of the}} format's most impressive new talents." ...|$|R

Melina is a mystery to everyone who knows her! Despite being extremely smart and first in class without lifting a single finger, Melina loooves picking her nose, sticking whoopee cushions on the teacher’s chair or devising the craziest of traps, {{with the purpose of}} ridiculing anyone and everyone around her!

5000|$|The narrator opens {{by asking}} the viewer if they <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the people they went to school with. He goes on {{to talk about his}} [...] "best mate", Johnno, a popular and rebellious boy at school. However, Johnno {{turns out to be a}} {{thoroughly}} obnoxious and violent person, frequently swindling, stealing, vandalizing property and generally committing antisocial acts. He apparently enjoys cruelty to animals, throwing hamsters and cats off high-rise flats and bricking ducks. Johnno once confused the narrator by falsely telling him his father had died (hence the film's title).|$|E

5000|$|Jon Bois {{wrote and}} {{illustrated}} 17776 for Vox Media's sports news website SB Nation, {{of which he}} is creative director. In winter 2016, Bois began developing an [...] "anti-sci fi" [...] project as a possible sequel to The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles, an earlier work for SB Nation, and set the story in a year far enough in the future that [...] "nobody <b>ever</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Although he liked the concept and the visuals, he believed the project would not connect with readers and shelved it. Later, he realized that the story needed a centering character; he wrote one {{in the form of a}} small town, AM radio talk show host before coming up with the characters of the probes. Development renewed in May 2016, and the project solidified after SB Nation published its article [...] "The Future of Football." [...] Bois described it as the biggest project he ever attempted.|$|R
5000|$|On March 28, 2009, a Spanish court, {{headed by}} Baltasar Garzón, {{the judge who}} ordered the arrest of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, {{announced}} it would begin an investigation into whether or not Gonzales, and five other former Bush Justice and Defense officials violated international law by providing the Bush Administration a legal framework and basis for the torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Garzón {{said that it was}} [...] "highly probable" [...] the matter would go to court and that arrest warrants would be issued. Also named in the Spanish court's investigation are John Yoo, Douglas Feith, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and David Addington. In April 2010, on the advice of the Spanish Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido, who believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court <b>ever</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge Garzon should drop his investigation.

5000|$|It {{has become}} a modern ritual {{tradition}} for Japanese students to eat katsudon the night before taking a major test or school entrance exam. This is because [...] "katsu" [...] is a homophone of the verb 勝つ katsu, meaning [...] "to win" [...] or [...] "to be victorious". It is also a famous gag of Japanese police films: many people think that suspects will speak the truth with tears when they have eaten katsudon and are asked, [...] "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how your mother feels about this?" [...] Even nowadays, the gag of [...] "We must eat katsudon while interrogating" [...] is popular in Japanese films.|$|E

2500|$|From that {{statement}} of March 1834, {{it does not}} appear that animosity still existed on the composer's part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: [...] "Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man" [...] and he continues by wondering if Romani <b>ever</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> him where he, Bellini, says [...] "whereas I do nothing but to talk about him to the entire universe". Then he ends with: [...] "Give him a kiss for me". This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states [...] "I have not ceased to love him , for I recognise that the blame is not all his".|$|R

'Course," [...] apologetically, [...] "you wouldn't ever want to touch anything in as small a burg as this, {{but in a way}} it's kind of a pity. I was just thinking of how the youngsters here would flock to have you give 'em your expert advice as a sporting gentleman, instead of hanging around that cheap-John shoe-store that those confounded worthless Simpson boys try to run." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2004, he {{told the}} Sunday Herald {{newspaper}} that the Bush administration had [...] "cheated {{to get into the}} White House. It's not something Americans <b>ever</b> want to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> their government. My sense of these people is that they don't have any respect for the public at large.

5000|$|The {{film was}} filmed during the blaxploitation era, where women's {{sexuality}} in movies {{was known to}} be liberated. Coffy was released in theaters in the same year, where the title character was defined by her appearance. Although Uptown Saturday Night did not show female characters as explicitly as Coffy, they were shown in a sexually-suggestive manner. Particularly, sexual liberation was present when Steve and Wardell arrived at Madame Zenobia's party. Women were very playful with the men, and their evening gowns showed a fair amount of skin. Another example lies {{at the beginning of the}} film, with the interaction of Steve and Sarah Jackson, his wife. While the two of them are reminiscing in the kitchen about when they first met, Steve keeps referencing her butt, to which she responds [...] "Don't you men <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> something else besides behinds?" [...] This reinforces physical attraction being the primary source of attraction in regards to the female. In spite of this, both Steve and Wardell treat their wives with respect, which highlights a positive message of equality within their marriages.|$|E
5000|$|IBS News is an American {{news channel}} {{that appears to}} be a parody of FOX News. The station's newsreaders, Anthony Markowitz and Julia Regan (Claudia Christian), give long pieces of opinion after every topic, often using the phrases 'I'm no expert' or 'I don't pretend to know much about this, but...'. Anthony tends to give colloquial, ill-informed opinion ("When you flush the toilet on an aeroplane, do you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> where it goes? I sure don't!"), while Julia gives {{incredibly}} political commentary on the outcome ("Imagine the effect this will have on the already strict aviation guidelines in force"). They then inevitably link the story, however tenuously, to the weather report ("No more frozen urine falling from the sky, but expect rain over North Carolina"). It also covers the [...] "Vincenti Trial", a parody of the Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson trials, where the main defendant is accused of murdering his wife who was having affairs with three different women in three hotels in three states simultaneously while technically dead ("Of course {{whether or not this is}} even possible has to be considered a legal nicety").|$|E
5000|$|On March 2, 2012, Limbaugh {{defended his}} {{previous}} comments about Fluke, saying, [...] "not one person says that, 'Well, did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> maybe backing off {{the amount of}} sex that you have?'" [...] Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is [...] "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed {{to have sex with}} three guys tonight.'" [...] Limbaugh commented on Fluke receiving a call from President Obama, who stated that her parents should be proud of her, saying, [...] "I'm gonna button my lip on that one." [...] He {{went on to say that}} if his daughter had testified that [...] "she's having so much sex she can't pay for it and wants a new welfare program to pay for it," [...] he would be [...] "embarrassed" [...] and [...] "disconnect the phone", [...] "go into hiding", and [...] "hope the media didn't find me". He continued later, [...] "Oh! Does she have more boyfriends? They're lined up around the block. They would have been in my day." [...] He continued that Fluke testified that her [...] "sex life is active. She's having sex so frequently that she can't afford all the birth-control pills that she needs. That's what she's saying." ...|$|E

5000|$|Murphey was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Geronimo's Cadillac" [...] by a photograph showing Apache chief Geronimo {{at the wheel of}} a luxury roadster: this photograph was reproduced as a drawing on the back album cover of Geronimo's Cadillac and also on the picture sleeve of the single. The July - August 1987 issue of [...] American Songwriter quotes Murphey as saying: [...] "the two images together Geronimo and a Cadillac just struck me as a song title. It was every irony I could <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of <b>about</b> our culture in two words. Their attempt to make of him what we would define as a civilized person. That was the reason they put him in a Cadillac in the first place. He was actually in jail at the time." [...] The photograph was taken at a show for the US press held June 11, 1905 at a ranch located southwest of Ponca City, Oklahoma: Geronimo, then imprisoned at Fort Sill, is actually posed in a Locomobile rather than a Cadillac.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} white racial frame {{generally has}} several levels of abstraction. At the most general level, the racial frame views whites as mostly superior in culture and achievement and views {{people of color}} as generally of less social, economic, and political consequence than whites—as inferior to whites in the making and keeping of the nation. At {{the next level of}} framing, whites view an array of social institutions as normally white-controlled and as unremarkable in the fact that whites therein are unjustly enriched and disproportionately privileged. At the lowest level of abstraction, negative stereotypes and images of the “inferior racial others” are constructed and accepted. This framing is so taken for granted that at no level is this white racial frame questioned or challenged by most whites. Relatively few whites <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> critically <b>about</b> its major contours and deep significance. Most whites collude tacitly in an agreement not to question it. The frame includes not only negative understandings of Americans of color, but also assertively positive understandings of whites and white institutions. White superiority is regularly coupled with ideas of inferiority of people of color.|$|R
