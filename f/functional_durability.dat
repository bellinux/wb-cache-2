40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{bioactivity}} and osteoconductivity, hydroxyapatite (HA) plasma sprayed coatings {{have been widely}} developed for orthopedic uses. However, the thermodynamic instability of HA leads frequently to a mixture of phases which limit the <b>functional</b> <b>durability</b> of the coating. This study investigates the plasma spraying of chlorapatite (ClA) powder, known to melt without decomposition, onto pure titanium substrates using a low energy plasma spray system (LEPS). Pure ClA powder was prepared by a solid gas reaction at 950 ° C and thermogravimetric analysis showed the good thermal stability of ClA powder in the range 30 - 1400 ° C {{compared to that of}} the HA powder. Characterization of ClA coating showed that ClA had a very high crystalline ratio and no other crystalline phase was detected in the coating. HA and ClA coatings composition, microstructure and in vitro bioactivity potential were studied, compared and discussed. In vitro SBF test on HA and ClA coatings revealed the formation of a poorly crystalline apatite on the coating surface suggesting that we could expect a good osteoconductivity especially for the ClA coating prepared by the LEPS system...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Flexible ureterorenoscopes (FURSs) are {{considered}} important additions to urology armamentarium. One {{of the technical}} drawbacks is the poor optic image provided by fiberoptic endoscope {{as well as the}} fragility of this conventional fiberoptic endoscope. This study aim is to evaluate practical performances and <b>functional</b> <b>durability</b> of the new Olympus digital flexible ureteroscope (ODF-URS) (URF-V) in a single center clinical setting. Materials and Methods: A number of 60 diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed over a period of 6 months in a single center (Tenon University Hospital), using a single ODF-URS (URF-V). This device provided a 275 ˚ maximal down-deflection (MDD) and 180 ˚ maximal up-deflection (MUD). Results: ODF-URS (URF-V) was used for a total time of 90 h and 30 min, with average time duration of 90. 5 min per procedure. After 60 procedures, MDD decreased from 275 ˚ to 217 ˚, while the MUD decreased from 180 ˚ to 161 ˚. During six procedures (10 %), URF-V failed to access inferior calyx due to a narrow lower calyx infundibulum. Conclusion: New ODF-URS (URF-V) is a reliable and durable device, with a good success rate and improved functional parameters. It is a superior device compared to predecessor generations of conventional fiberoptic endoscopes for the light source and the image quality; however, randomized comparative studies are necessary to evaluate performances and durability of this device...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and <b>functional</b> <b>durability</b> of the American Medical Systems 800 (AMS 800) artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) device {{for patients with}} neurogenic and non-neurogenic incontinence. Methods From 1985 to 2000, 38 patients underwent implantation of an AMS 800 AUS at our institution. Thirty of these patients had complete records and follow-up data available. The mean follow-up for these two groups of patients was six years. Seventeen devices (57 %) were implanted for non-neurogenic indications including incontinence after prostatectomy or hysterectomy. Thirteen devices (43 %) were implanted for neurogenic conditions including spina bifida, spinal cord injury or severe pelvic trauma. The primary end point measured was continence. Secondary end points included mechanical and non-mechanical device failure, re-operation and complication rates between the two groups. Results In the neurogenic group, only two patients (15 %) have their original device in situ without revisions. Only three patients (23 %) in this group are entirely dry. In contrast, seven patients (41 %) in the non-neurogenic group are completely dry with their original device in situ. A further four (23 %) are entirely dry after device revision or replacement surgery. The rates of mechanical failure were not statistically different between the two groups. The rate of non-mechanical failure (NMF) was statistically greater in the neurogenic group in comparison {{to that in the}} non-neurogenic group (p< 0. 05). Conclusions Insertion of an AMS 800 artificial sphincter remains a durable means of regaining urinary continence.

Grupo I: abaixo de 6 meses (m) com 12 pac. (1 óbito; 8, 3 %); Grupo II: entre 7 m e 12 m, com 15 pac. (4 óbitos; 26, 6 %) e Grupo III: entre 1 e 5 anos (a) com 7 pac. sem óbitos. Ocorreram 2 óbitos tardios (1 por Insuficiência mitral residual + insuficiência cardíaca congestiva e outro por pneumonia + insuficiência respiratória). Duas crianças receberam implante de marcapasso definitivo (após 45 dias e 4 anos). Nenhum paciente foi reoperado, apesar de mais 2 apresentarem insuficiência da VAV esquerda e 1 VAV direita, controlada clinicamente, e as restantes encontram-se nos graus I e II da New York Heart Association (NYHA). Apesar de 29 pacientes apresentarem peso abaixo de 10 kg, utilizou-se circulação extracorpórea (CEC) e hipotermia a 25 °C sem parada circulatória total. Iniciou-se o reparo pela zona de "aposição" da VAV única com um ou dois pontos em "x", mantendo tricúspide. Sutura-se o primeiro retalho de pericárdio bovino (PB) em forma de "gota", insinuando-o entre as cordas do lado direito do septo; a seguir, sutura-se o segundo retalho, fazendo uma aposição concomitante com a VAV única, septando-se, desta forma, as quatro cavidades. As vantagens desta técnica são: preservação da integridade valvar, maior durabilidade funcional da VAV esquerda, menor possibilidade de reoperação mesmo em pacientes mais jovens e que devem ser preferencialmente operados em torno de 6 º mês de vida. Between May 1987 and December 1996, {{repair of}} the "Ostium Atrioventricularis Communis" (OAVC), with total shaping {{by means of}} a double bovine pericardial patch and tricuspidation of the left atrioventricular valve (AVV) was performed on 34 consecutive patients with overall mortality of 5 patients (pat.) (14. 7 %). Group I: Less than 6 months (m) 12 pat. (1 death: 8. 3 %); Group II: 7 m to 12 m, 15 pat. (4 deaths: 26. 6 %) and Group III: between 1 and 5 years (y) 7 pat. (no deaths). Two deaths occurred later (residual mitral insufficiency + congestive heart failure and pneumonia + respiratory insufficiency). Two children received implants of definitive pacemakers (after 45 days and 4 years). Despite the fact that 2 registered insufficiency of the left AVV and one showed insufficiency of the right AVV, these cases were controlled clinically and no children were reoperated. The remaining children are classified between degree I and II of the New York Heart Association (NYHA). Although 29 patients weighted less than 10 kg, extracorporeal circulation was utilized together with hypothermia at 25 °C without total circulatory interruption.

40|$|The {{physical}} and social space in which a consumer finds herself is a large influencing factor on product evaluation and decision-making (Solomon & Rabolt, 2004 : 434). De Klerk (1999) states that, although most clothing consumers have a preconceived idea about where to go shopping for clothing and which type of clothing is desired, the final decision-making takes place within the store where consumers need information about the clothing products in order to evaluate the quality {{and to be able}} to make the final decision. It is said that retailers need to spend enough money, space and time on fitting rooms as the fitting room can be seen as the point and place where most apparel-based decisions are made (Lee & Johnson, sa: 2). Fitting rooms are one of the critical areas in clothing stores; this is where the consumer tries on apparel products, makes evaluations about the products, and decisions to buy these apparel products or not (Rea, Mang & Underhill, as quoted by Baumstarck, 2008 : 12). The research problem of this study is that in order for consumers to evaluate apparel products effectively and to make apparel buying decisions with which they can be satisfied, the fitting room experience plays a role. However, it is not known how consumers evaluate apparel products’ quality and how the fitting room experience should be in order for the consumers to evaluate the apparel products’ quality effectively. Therefore the purpose of this study was to explore and describe the role of the fitting room experience in Mzansi youth female consumers’ evaluation of apparel products’ quality. The retail experience entails the aesthetic (stimulus, emotion and cognition) as well as functional (synchronising impressions, layout, space, service, furniture & fixtures) aspects. Evaluation of apparel quality comprises intrinsic, extrinsic and behavioural characteristics. The behavioural characteristics include the apparel products’ <b>functional</b> (<b>durability,</b> comfort and maintenance) and aesthetic (stimulus, emotion and cognition) qualities. The justification for conducting this research was that this research could lead to the generation of new information. This information may be used by retailers to enhance the fitting room experience in order to make it easier for consumers to evaluate apparel products’ quality, so that the most appropriate apparel buying decisions can be made and customer satisfaction may be increased. The confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm was used as theoretical perspective for the study. This paradigm was integrated with the literature and the relevant concepts to form the conceptual framework which directed the study. This study was conducted qualitatively where the aim was to explore and describe the phenomenon. Phenomenology was used as strategy of inquiry. The Mzansi youth female consumers, who are part of the Black Diamond consumer group, were used as unit of analysis for this study, as the literature indicates that the Black Diamonds are the fastest growing consumer group within South Africa. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to accumulate the participants of the study. Fifteen females took part in this study. Fortunately data saturation did occur, so no more participants were needed. The researcher used unstructured interviews to gather data as well as a photo-elicitation technique. The photos were used as an external stimulus in the interview process. This ensured data with depth and breadth. Two interviews (approximately 30 minutes each) were held with each participant. The second interview was only conducted after each participant had completed a specific task. The data was analysed by using the five steps suggested by Yin (2011 : 176). The findings showed that the fitting room experience does play a crucial role in the Mzansi youth female consumer’s evaluation of apparel products’ quality. Furthermore it showed that the Mzansi youth female consumers do have clear expectations regarding the fitting room’s aesthetics and functionality, and also how these two elements should interact and should be in order for the Mzansi youth female consumer to be able to evaluate the apparel products’ quality effectively. The findings further showed that when these expectations are not met by the actual fitting room experience it leads to the Mzansi youth female consumer being dissatisfied and therefore stopping her evaluation of the apparel products’ quality or even leaving the store. Therefore this study came to the overall conclusion that the fitting room is the place where the final decision to buy or not to buy is made, and where decisions about possible future visits are made, irrespective of the rest of the retail environment. It should therefore be treated like the queen of the apparel retail environment, and certainly not like the Cinderella.

The contracting authority, selecting one tender out of many available tenders, assesses them, taking into account various criteria, e. g. price, expected execution time and the contractor's experience. The owner of a company intending to purchase the fixed assets requisite for the realization of the project behaves similarly, i. e. the most advantageous model of the device is chosen, taking into account not only its price but also production capacity, energy intensity, noise emission, service availability, etc. From among many concepts, the investor has to choose a solution which frequently constitutes a compromise between price, <b>functional</b> properties, <b>durability</b> and aesthetics of performance, as well as safety of the utilization and impact on the environment. The choice of an investment location depends not only on the market, financial and supply factors, but also on so called soft factors such as the perceived quality of institutions and the attitude of local communities.

40|$|In the {{combined}} cycle technology for advanced coal fired power plants at high temperatures up to 950 °C {{the removal of}} particles from the stream to the gas turbine is carried out with ceramic filter elements. These elements consist often of siliceous bonded coarse grained silicon carbide. A stable long term operation of the filter elements leads to the demands on good resistance towards thermal, mechanical and chemical loading. The structure of ceramic filter elements consists usually of a highly porous support which ensures the mechanical strength and a layer which operates as the functional part for the particle removal. Thereby the lifetime of the whole element is mainly determined by the lifetime of the support material and not by the <b>functional</b> layer.

We sought to evaluate AUS outcomes among patients subsequently diagnosed with bladder cancer, {{in order to}} describe device survivability when subject to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as cystoscopy, transurethral resection, and cystectomy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1, 803 male patients treated with AUS surgery at a single institution between 1983 – 2014. We describe AUS device outcomes among patients undergoing surveillance and treatment for bladder cancer. Results: Following AUS placement, 14 (0. 8 %) patients were subsequently diagnosed with and treated for bladder cancer and 4 patients with bladder cancer undergoing treatment and screening, subsequently received AUS placement. The median follow-up from device placement was 7. 2 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2. 8 – 11. 5), and the median time from AUS placement to bladder cancer diagnosis was 6 (IQR, 0 – 9). There were a total of 8 primary and 1 secondary devices failures. Despite a median of 2 diagnostic cystoscopies (IQR, 1 – 6) and 0 bladder tumor resections (IQR, 0 – 0) per patient following device implantation, only 1 (5. 6 %) patient experienced an iatrogenic erosion related to urethral manipulation.

We used radiostereometric analysis (RSA) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether there are any differences in migration of the tibial component between CAS- and conventionally (CONV-) operated TKA. Patients and methods - 54 patients (CAS, n = 26; CONV, n = 28) {{with a mean age of}} 67 (56 - 78) years and with osteoarthritis or arthritic disease of the knee were recruited from 4 hospitals during the period 2009 - 2011. To estimate the mechanical stability of the tibial component, the patients were examined with RSA up to 24 months after operation. The following parameters representing tibial component micromotion were measured: 3 -D vector of the prosthetic marker that moved the most, representing the magnitude of migration (maximum total point motion, MTPM); the largest negative value for y-translation (subsidence); the largest positive y-translation (lift-off); and prosthetic rotations. The precision of the RSA measurements was evaluated and migration in the 2 groups was compared. Results - Both groups had most migration within the first 3 months, but there was no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of the migration between the CAS group and the CONV group. From 3 to 24 months, the MTPM (in mm) was 0. 058 and 0. 103 (p = 0. 1) for the CAS and CON groups, respectively, and the subsidence (in mm) was 0. 005 and 0. 011 (p = 0. 3).

MethodsFifteen juvenile sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 3 study arms and underwent pulmonary valve replacement. The arms included the following: (1) cryopreserved ovine pulmonary valves; (2) cryopreserved, decellularized, saline (1 °C– 10 °C) –stored ovine pulmonary valves; and (3) cryopreserved, decellularized, glycerolized (− 80 °C) stored ovine pulmonary valves. Animal growth, serial echocardiographic results (with valve performance assessment), dimensions, and tissue-specific calcification measurements were compared with pre-explant angiographic analysis and right ventricular outflow tract pressure measurements, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, specimen radiographic analysis, gross explant pathology, and histopathology. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis were performed. ResultsAll but 2 study animals receiving implants thrived postoperatively, with similar growth rates, explant valve dimensions, ventricular functions, cardiac output, and indices during the study. As determined by means of echocardiographic analysis, 3 animals in arm 1 (and one in arm 2) had leaflet dysfunction. Valve regurgitation was recognized in 1 survivor each from both arms 1 and 2. Although 1 arm 1 animal died with calcified subacute bacterial endocarditis, and the other 4 had leaflet and conduit wall calcification by the time of death, no arm 2 or arm 3 animals demonstrated leaflet calcium, and no arm 3 and only 1 arm 2 animals had calcium in the conduit wall over the entire year, as determined with any measurement method. All cryopreserved conduit walls had calcium by 20 weeks, whereas only 1 of 10 decellularized conduits (arms 2 plus 3) had wall calcium. ConclusionCryopreserved–decellularized–glycerolized valves retained normal valve function, with absent leaflet and minimal wall calcifications 1 year postoperatively, as opposed to classically cryopreserved allografts. These results might be predictive of the prolonged durability and functionality of a cryopreserved–decellularized–glycerolized allograft valve...|$|R

MethodsFrom January 1998 to December 2002, 245 dialysis access procedures were performed at University Hospital and the Veteran Affairs Medical Center in New Jersey. Follow-up data were available for 125 procedures (TAVF, n = 42; AVF, n = 30; AVG, n = 53) performed in 97 patients. All access procedures were planned {{on the basis of}} preoperative duplex scans of arm and forearm veins. Functional patency was defined as ability to cannulate and hemodialyze patients successfully. Primary and secondary cumulative functional patency of TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs was determined with life table analysis, and differences were analyzed with the log-rank test. Differences in revision rates, including thrombolysis, thrombectomies, and operative revisions, were determined with the Fisher exact t test. ResultsMean follow-up was 18 months (range, 4 - 24 months). For TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs, primary functional patency rate at 1 year was 76. 2 %, 53. 3 %, and 47. 2 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 67. 7 %, 34. 4 %, and 25. 5 %, respectively. Similarly, secondary functional patency rate at 1 year was 83. 2 %, 66. 7 %, and 58. 5 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 74. 6 %, 56. 2 %, and 40. 2 %, respectively. Primary and secondary functional patency rates for TAVFs were superior to those for AVGs at 1 and 2 years (P <. 001). AVFs had superior secondary functional patency rate at 2 years, compared with AVGs (P <. 05), and TAVFs had superior primary and secondary patency rates at 2 years, compared with AVFs (P <. 05). AVGs required significantly more revisions than did TAVFs (28. 5 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 001) or AVFs (36. 7 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 05). ConclusionsPreoperative duplex scanning of upper arm and forearm veins facilitated successful creation of all types of autogenous fistulas at our institution. TAVF cumulative functional patency rates were superior compared with AVGs and AVFs. Furthermore, TAVFs and AVFs were more durable and required fewer revisions than did AVGs. When preoperative duplex criteria indicate that TAVFs can be performed, they should be the initial access of choice, because of their superior long-term patency and durability...|$|R
30|$|In the past, below-knee {{amputation}} {{used to be}} the standard surgical treatment for distal tibial tumours and limb salvage surgery was rarely considered. With advances in neoadjuvant chemotherapy and oncological treatment, various limb salvage reconstructive techniques have come up which include large segmental allografts, vascularised or avascular autografts, osteoarticular allograft, bone transport, endoprosthesis and reimplantation of the tumour-bearing bone segment after the devitalization of the tumour cells by heating, freezing, or extracorporeal irradiation [4 – 14]. However, reconstructing defects after resection of a distal tibial tumour remains challenging due to precarious soft tissue cover at this site. When evaluating a reconstruction technique, the factors which need to be considered are the ease of the procedure, its morbidity, complications, <b>functional</b> outcome and <b>durability.</b> The use of the avascular strut allograft is often limited by the available length of the resection, risk of nonunion, fracture and infection, besides the fear of disease transmission [21]. The use of a free-vascularised fibular transfer from the contralateral limb adds morbidity to the normal limb, is time-consuming and requires a specialised microsurgical team. Free fibular graft from the contralateral leg in the presence of extensive dissections may necrose; and even if it survives it may {{take a long time to}} heal with poor functional outcome [15]. Distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov technique is a time consuming procedure. Although early weight-bearing is possible, there is risk of pin track infection and the frame is not very well accepted by most of the patients [22]. Endoprosthetic replacement of the distal tibia has the potential advantage of immediate stability and rapid restoration of ankle function. However, there is paucity of data on long-term evaluation of use of megaprostheses of the ankle, and the short-term results are not encouraging. It has been reported to be associated with high failure rates related to the instability, malalignment or difficulties in anchoring the prosthesis to the talus. Other reported complications include infection, inadequate soft tissue coverage and talar collapse [4, 23]. Abudu et al. [4] in their series of endoprosthetic replacement reported rapid deterioration in a patient’s ultimate outcome despite good initial functioning. Natarajan et al. reported a secondary amputation rate as high as 50  % after limb salvage with megaprosthesis. In their study of six patients with prosthetic replacement, four required soft tissue reconstruction with a muscle pedicle flap. Of the other two patients, one developed flap necrosis and deep infection and finally underwent amputation. Two patients developed local recurrence of the tumour and also required above-knee amputation [24].|$|R
