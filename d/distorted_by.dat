5|$|In 802, Harun and {{the most}} {{powerful}} officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards {{the extent of the}} autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5000|$|Bord et al. {{claim that}} a {{substantial}} portion of the United States public has a flawed understanding of global warming, seeing it as linked to general [...] "pollution" [...] and causally connected in some way to atmospheric ozone depletion. News reporters have been labeled by some scientists as ignorant about the science of climate change. Scientists and media scholars who express frustrations with inadequate science reporting argue that it can lead to at least three basic distortions. First, journalists <b>distort</b> reality <b>by</b> making scientific errors. Second, they <b>distort</b> <b>by</b> keying on human-interest stories rather than scientific content. And third, journalists <b>distort</b> <b>by</b> rigid adherence to the construct of balanced coverage. Bord, O’Connor, & Fisher (2000) argue that responsible citizenry necessitates a concrete knowledge of causes and that until, for example, the public understands what causes climate change it cannot be expected to take voluntary action to mitigate its effects.|$|R

5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself. It is assumed that Vismantas' wife and Morta are the same woman. It is known that Vismatas died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta's wedding is unknown. There is no consensus on how many children Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons, whose name got <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> scribes, or they are four sons. There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it would indicate that, whether there were two or four sons, they had perished in their youth.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|Peter Frankopan {{has argued}} that the First Crusade has been {{fundamentally}} <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also {{as a result of a}} state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope Urban II was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan goes further, showing that the Crusade's primary military targets in Asia Minor - Nicaea and Antioch - required large numbers of men with experience of siege warfare; precisely the sort recruited by Urban during his preaching in France in 1095-6.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period {{structures}} in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout {{consists of a}} westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was {{likely to have been}} the temple of Awilix, patron goddess of the Nija'ib' K'iche'. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This K'iche' layout was somewhat <b>distorted</b> <b>by</b> the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, the juxtaposition of Mam- and K'iche'-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages.|$|E
