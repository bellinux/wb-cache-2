40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} there was a significant relationship between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission to the University and academic achievement of freshmen at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. ACT data were utilized to determine whether early applicants possessed characteristics predictive of academic performance. The research explored whether or not <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> differentially related to grade point average and credit hours completed. It also {{attempted to}} ascertain whether earlier appliers for admission to college were higher achievers in high school, more decisive about future goals, and more involved in non-academic activities than later appliers. These variables were then examined in relationship to academic performance. All freshmen entering the University for the 1979 - 1980 academic year with complete ACT data on file were examined with reference to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for admission. The sample was comprised of 1, 157 first-time, full-time, 18 year old students. Students were classified as earlier or later applicants based on their <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> to the University. Pearson Product Moment Correlations and Multiple Regression Analyses were applied to determine the relationship between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> first year grade point average and credit hours completed, and ACT profile variables. Significant relationships (p. <. 001) were found between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> first year grade point average, high school rank, certainty of first vocational choice and predicted first year grade point average. It was concluded that <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> had some value as a predictor of academic performance. Earlier applicants had achieved higher high school rank, expressed greater degree of certainty regarding educational and vocational plans, and predicted higher first year grade point average. It was also found that high school rank, ACT composite scores, and predicted first year grade point average were highly correlated with academic performance. These findings were consistent with previous research conducted on academic variables as predictors of success in college...|$|R
