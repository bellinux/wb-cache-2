There are several generally accepted criteria which define this disorder, however other conditions with a similar presentation, such as <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> must first be ruled out.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of latent infections in sensory neurons is a remarkably effective immune evasion strategy {{that accounts for}} the widespread dissemination of life long Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV 1) infections in humans.

30|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes various {{infections in}} humans, {{including}} <b>encephalitis.</b> <b>HSV</b> {{is the most}} common cause of non-epidemic encephalitis worldwide (Granerod et al. 2010; Banatvala 2011). Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare disease. The majority of cases (> 90 %) are due to HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) and HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) is the main cause of neonatal HSV infection (Aurelius et al. 1993). In a recent Swedish nationwide register-based study the incidence of confirmed HSE was 2.2 cases per million population per year (Hjalmarsson et al. 2007). The mortality of patients with HSE is 70 % in the absence of treatment and most survivors have severe neurological impairment (Whitley et al. 1977). In the past 3 decades, two major improvements have improved mortality and morbidity of patients with HSE. In the mid- 1980 s two large randomized trials showed that treatment with intravenous acyclovir (ACV) reduced the mortality rate and decreased morbidity (Whitley et al. 1986; Skoldenberg et al. 1984). The establishment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based diagnosis of HSV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has facilitated faster and more reliable diagnosis of the disease, replacing the previous gold standard of brain biopsy (Aurelius et al. 1991; Lakeman and Whitley 1995; Scoular et al. 2002; Cinque et al. 1996). Furthermore, diagnostic accuracy has improved markedly with advances in neuroradiological imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Domingues et al. 1998). Despite these advances the mortality is 15 – 20 % and prevalence of neurological sequelae may range from 20 – 50 (Whitley et al. 1986; Raschilas et al. 2002).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{outcome of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} (<b>HSV)</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is {{improved}} with prompt initiation of aciclovir treatment. Delays are common, {{but there is little}} under-standing of why they occur. The case notes of 21 adults admitted with suspected <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> over one year were reviewed. The median (range) duration of illness was 2. 5 (1 – 99) days. Seventeen (81 %) patients had a lumbar puncture (LP) performed, at a median (range) time of 24 (2 – 114) hours after encephalitis was suspected. Lumbar puncture was delayed for a computed tomography (CT) scan in 15 patients, but only one of these had contraindications to an immediate LP. The median (range) time from presenta-tion to starting aciclovir was 48 (2 – 432) hours. HSV-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was requested on cerebrospinal fluid from 12 patients, one of whom was positive. Five (24 %) patients were given the wrong dose of aciclovir. Overall the management of suspected <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> was often sub-optimal, with delays in LP occurring due to unnec-essary CT scans, and the wrong aciclovir dose administered.

40|$|Viruses are parasites {{capable of}} infecting {{all forms of}} life. They lack the ability to {{replicate}} by themselves and therefore hijack the replication machinery of cells to produce new viral copies, called virions. Two steps of this replication cycle are of particular interest {{in the frame of}} this thesis: the initial attachment of the virus to the cell membrane and the release of the virus from the cell membrane after infection. One virus for which these mechanisms are still under investigation is the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is commonly known for causing blisters on the skin or mucosa of the lips, mouth or genitals. In rare cases, it can migrate to the central nervous system, causing meningitis or <b>encephalitis.</b> <b>HSV</b> is an enveloped DNA virus that binds to the cell membrane via interactions between viral glycoproteins and cell-surface sulfated polysaccharide chains, called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The main focus of the work presented here was the interaction between HSV and surface immobilized GAGs. The individual GAG chains were end-grafted to a sensor surface to mimic the brush-like architecture of GAGs found close to the cell surface. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) was used to extract information on binding kinetics and mobility of single fluorescently labeled HSV particles. Two aspects of the HSV-GAG interaction were studied in detail: First, the influence of the sulfation of the GAG chains on the binding characteristics, and second, the role of glycosylation of the viral glycoproteins. Binding studies of HSV to different GAGs showed that the degree of sulfation of the GAG influences the binding affinity of HSV. Furthermore, single particle tracking (SPT) analysis revealed that HSV diffuses on the GAG surface and that this mobility is influenced by the affinity of the HSV-GAG bonds. Finally, experiments involving virus mutants demonstrated that the glycosylation of the viral glycoproteins plays a critical role in the release of HSV virions from the surface of infected cells. Taken together, two aspects modulating the interaction between the herpes simplex virus and glycosaminolgycans were identified in this thesis, providing new insights into the mechanisms that regulate the initial attachment of the virus to the cell membrane and its release from the cell membrane after infection. In addition, the mobility of the HSV particles observed with the model system suggests that the virus is able to diffuse on the cell membrane in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background Herpes simplex virus (<b>HSV)</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is a {{life-threatening}} {{infection of the}} brain, which has significant physical, cognitive and social consequences for survivors. Despite increasing recognition of {{the long-term effects of}} encephalitis, research and policy remains largely focused on its acute management, meaning there is little understanding of the difficulties people face after discharge from acute care. This paper aims to chart the problems and challenges which people encounter when they return home after treatment for <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> Methods The paper reports on data from 30 narrative interviews with 45 people affected by <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> and their significant others. The study was conducted as part of the ENCEPH-UK programme grant on Understanding and Improving the Outcome of Encephalitis.

40|$|AimTo {{assess the}} role of imaging in the early {{management}} of encephalitis and the agreement on findings in a well-defined cohort of suspected encephalitis cases enrolled in the Prospective Aetiological Study of Encephalitis conducted by the Health Protection Agency (now incorporated into Public Health England). Materials and methodsEighty-five CT examinations from 68 patients and 101 MRI examinations from 80 patients with suspected encephalitis were independently rated by three neuroradiologists blinded to patient and clinical details. The level of agreement on the interpretation of images was measured using the kappa statistic. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of CT and MRI for herpes simplex virus (<b>HSV)</b> <b>encephalitis</b> and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) were estimated. ResultsThe kappa value for interobserver agreement on rating the scans as normal or abnormal was good (0. 65) for CT and moderate (0. 59) for MRI. Agreement for <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> was very good for CT (0. 87) and MRI (0. 82), but only fair for ADEM (0. 32 CT; 0. 31 MRI). Similarly, the overall sensitivity of imaging for <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> was ∼ 80 % for both CT and MRI, whereas for ADEM it was 0 % for CT and 20 % for MRI.

A low dose of 40 to 160 mg per m 2 per day was given for 4 to 6 days by continuous intravenous infusion and, except in two cases, by intrathecal administration. In one patient, idoxuridine (IUdR) at the dose of 1 g every 4 h was also administered after 4 days of Ara-C therapy. Both neonates and two of four adults survived. Their clinical improvement was closely related {{in time to the}} onset of therapy with Ara-C (cases 1, 2, 3) and with IUdR (case 4). In one adult who died on the 27 th day of illness of a massive pulmonary embolus, postmortem examination of the brain did not disclose viral inclusions, and viral culture was negative. In the other patient who died, however, brain culture postmortem was still positive for HSV despite 4 days of Ara-C therapy. Ara-C, in addition to IUdR, may be effective in <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> treatment, but double-blind, controlled studies appear to be necessary with these agents...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of acute encephalitis. Methods: Records of 151 cases from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Cases that met {{the definition of}} encephalitis were included and patients with bacterial meningoencephalitis or a post-operation infection were excluded. A total of 25 cases were enrolled after this screening; and age, sex, underlying diseases, brain computed tomography (CT) scan results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, and cerebrospinal fluid data were analyzed. Results: One patient positive for herpes simplex virus-I (HSV-I) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and one patient positive for HSV-II by PCR were detected among the 25 cases. Two positive Mycoplasma encephalitis cases by PCR were confirmed. One patient, who was human immunodeficiency virus positive, was diagnosed as having cerebral toxoplasmosis by brain MRI, serology results, and clinical response to treatment. All the patients’ brain CT scans showed no abnormalities. Among the 12 patients receiving brain MRI, six patients showed hyper-intense signs that were typical of <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> Acyclovir was given to four patients when the MRI results indicated a high suspicion of <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> or {{when there was a}} clinical suspicion. Three of the 25 cases died. All of the patients who received acyclovir treatment survived. Conclusion: Brain MRI results have more clinical value than CT scans when diagnosing encephalitis. The administration of antibiotics should be discouraged when the clinical picture is consistent with <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The timing of any administration of acyclovir should rely more on MRI than on the HSV PCR results because the sensitivity is low and the test is relatively unreliable. Early diagnosis and prompt management with acyclovir, especially when HSV is considered to be the cause of the encephalitis, are extremely crucial in order to obtain a better outcome...|$|E

METHOD We conducted a case report and systematic literature review (up to 10 December 2016), focused on differences between herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis phases, age-related characteristics of HSV-induced anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and therapy. For statistical analyses, McNemar’s test, Fisher’s test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used (two-tailed signiﬁcance level set at 5...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Encephalitis {{can cause}} a severe public health problem. The main aim of this {{research}} was to evaluate the medical laboratory results of patients with Herpes Simplex Virus (<b>HSV)</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> Materials and Methods: Diagnosis of encephalitis for these patients was firstly based on a clinical profile for Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE), plus either a detected HSV 1 & 2 -DNA by PCR in CSF or brain neuro-imaging results. Results: Molecular testing on CSF showed that 15 patients (15 %) had HSV infection, 5 patients (5 %) had Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and one case was positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -RNA in CSF. The cause of encephalitis in 79 out of 100 patients (79 %) was unknown. The comparison of CSF analysis in HSV positives and negatives showed a significant increase of glucose and protein levels in HSV positives than negatives. The mortality rate was 46. 6 % (7 / 15) in patients with <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> compared to 11. 4 % (10 / 85) in non-HSV encephalitis (P = 0. 003). Conclusions: In the current study, 15 % of cases were diagnosed as having HSV...|$|E
40|$|Herpes Simplex Virus (<b>HSV)</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} Central Nervous System (CNS), usually affecting the limbic structures, the median temporal cortex, and the orbitofrontal regions. Its annual incidence has significantly increased over the last 20 years and the mortality rate is 7 %, if early diagnosed and treated, and 70 %, if left untreated, while it is associated with high rates of morbidity. It {{should be noted that}} even when Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis seems normal, imaging studies are not specific and HSV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is negative; the clinician should be more aggressive, if clinical presentation is indicative for <b>HSV</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> by administrating acyclovir early after patient’s admission. The latter may be a vital intervention for the patient, modifying the patient’s clinical course. Through the presentation of two cases of HSV- 1 encephalitis that we managed in our department over the last 1 year and after systematic and comprehensive research of the relevant literature, we aim at showing the crucial role of medical history and physical examination, along with the high index of clinical suspicion, in order to make promptly the diagnosis and administer timely intravenous acyclovir, limiting the possibility of complications during the disease’s course...|$|E
