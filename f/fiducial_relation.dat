40|$|We present {{constraints}} on cosmological parameters {{based on a}} sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected (SZ-selected) galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The cluster sample {{used in this analysis}} consists of nine optically confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 deg 2 of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal with a four-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives σ 8 = 0. 851 ± 0. 115 and w = - 1. 14 ± 0. 35 for a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP seven-year constraints alone. Fixing the scaling relation between the cluster mass and SZ signal to a <b>fiducial</b> <b>relation</b> obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray observations, we find σ 8 = 0. 821 ± 0. 044 and w = - 1. 05 ± 0. 20. These results are consistent with constraints from WMAP 7 plus baryon acoustic oscillations plus Type Ia supernova which give σ 8 = 0. 802 ± 0. 038 and w = - 0. 98 ± 0. 053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement. These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from them are broadly consistent with current models. © 2011.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{pioneering}} measurements of galaxy kinematics at intermediate redshifts, {{we have begun}} a pilot survey to measure rotation curves for blue, star-forming galaxies between 0. 05 <z< 0. 35. The scientific impetus for such measurements is to construct internal velocity - luminosity relations at redshifts substantial enough to make cosmological and evolutionary tests. Departures from a <b>fiducial</b> <b>relation</b> {{as a function of}} redshift are sensitive to both space-time curvature and the evolution of the mass-to-light ratio in galaxies. Because of this ambiguity [...] curvature vs. evolution [...] kinematics should be viewed as a new cosmological tool at intermediate redshifts to be combined with additional measurements. In particular, the apparent internal velocities, colors, surface-brightness, and image shape are all unaffected by curvature, so that this ensemble of observables can be used unambiguously to explore galaxy evolution. Here we discuss a well-defined method of target selection which assures efficient measurement of spatially and spectrally resolved kinematics, namely rotation curves. Spatial resolution is critical since it is difficult to use integrated line-widths to distinguish between, for example, a low-mass star-forming galaxy and a high-mass galaxy with a central star-burst. For 18 of 19 appropriately selected galaxies to B< 20. 5 from Bershady et al (1994), we have successfully measured rotation curves using the KAST spectrograph on the Lick 3 m telescope with 1 - 2 hour integrations for each target. As a sanity check, we present preliminary results for half of our sample: We measure H 0 to be ~ 75 km/s/Mpc at a median redshift of 0. 15.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the luminosity-size relationship {{as a function of}} environment for 12150 SDSS galaxies with precise visual classifications from the catalog of Nair & Abraham (2010 a). Our analysis is subdivided into investigations of early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies. Early-type galaxies reveal a surprisingly tight luminosity-size relation. The dispersion in luminosity about the <b>fiducial</b> <b>relation</b> is only ~ 0. 14 dex (0. 35 mag), even though the sample contains galaxies which differ by a factor of almost 100 in luminosity. The dispersion about the luminosity-size relation is comparable to the dispersion about the fundamental plane, even though the luminosity-size relation is fundamentally simpler and computed using purely photometric parameters. The key contributors to the dispersion about the luminosity-size relation are found to be color and central concentration. Expanding our analysis to the full range of morphological types, we show that the slope, zero point, and scatter about the luminosity-size relation is independent of environmental density. Our study thus indicates that whatever process is building galaxies is doing so in a way that preserves fundamental scaling laws even as the typical luminosity of galaxies changes with environment. However, the distribution of galaxies along the luminosity-size relation is found to be strongly dependent on galaxy environment. This variation is in the sense that, at a given morphology, larger and more luminous galaxies are rarer in sparser environments. Our analysis of late-type galaxy morphologies reveals that scatter increases towards later Hubble types. Taken together, these results place strong constraints on conventional hierarchical models in which galaxies are built up in an essentially stochastic way.

40|$|The “loose end ” of the girder {{presents}} an alignment problem {{because there is}} no beam based alignment procedure available to position it. The positioning always depends on the fiducialization of the undulator. A direct way to position the “loose end ” to the next quadrupole is to measure their <b>fiducials</b> in <b>relation</b> to each other. By spanning a wire over a distance of several girders, each undulator and quadrupole can be measured by reading its distance to the wire with a portable wire sensor. The pitch of a girder can be determined by measuring height differences at different points on the girder. To measure the height differences a portable HLS is used. During the measurements of the portable system the permanent Wire Position Monitor and the permanent HLS are used to monitor the interim movements of the girder. After the initial alignment the position of the “loose end ” can be monitored with the permanent systems in relation to the quadrupoles. Portable wire measurements A wire is spanned over 6 girders using the space at the long breaks to setup stands for the wire.

40|$|We {{present results}} from an {{on-going}} [O II] λ 3727 and Hα rotationcurve survey {{to study the}} evolution of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of spiral galaxies selected over a wide, well-defined range in rest-frame color to z = 0. 4. Optical–near-infrared photometry and long-slit spectra are combined to measure residuals from a <b>fiducial</b> Tully-Fisher (TF) <b>relation</b> as a function of redshift and galaxy spectral type. While we do find a type-dependence in the B-band TF relation, there is little evidence the dependence has changed with look-back time. Larger or more detailed kinematic studies will yield further insights. We demonstrate, for example, how integral field spectroscopy will provide fundamentally new and more precise information about the evolution of star-forming disks. 1. Evolution of star-forming galaxies The study of galaxy evolution has focused largely on the relative frequency (counts) of photometric properties as a function of redshift and magnitude, such as luminosity, color, and image structure.

40|$|Recent {{estimates}} of the Cepheid distance modulus of NGC 6822 differ by 0. 18 mag. To investigate this we present new multi-epoch JHKs photometry of classical Cepheids in the central region of NGC 6822 and {{show that there is}} a zero-point difference from earlier work. These data together with optical and mid-infrared observations from the literature are used to derive {{estimates of}} the distance modulus of NGC 6822. A best value of 23. 40 mag is adopted, based on an LMC distance modulus of 18. 50 mag. The standard error of this quantity is ~ 0. 05 mag. We show that to derive consistent moduli from Cepheid observations at different wavelengths, it is necessary that the <b>fiducial</b> LMC period-luminosity <b>relations</b> at these wavelengths should refer to the same subsample of stars. Such a set is provided. A distance modulus based on RR Lyrae variables agrees with the Cepheid result. Comment: accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|The {{slope and}} zero-point of the unevolved main {{sequence}} {{as a function}} of metallicity are investigated using a homogeneous catalog of nearby field stars with absolute magnitudes defined with revised Hipparcos parallaxes, Tycho- 2 photometry, and precise metallicities from high-dispersion spectroscopy. (B-V) -temperature relations are derived from 1746 stars between [Fe/H] = - 0. 5 and + 0. 6 and 372 stars within 0. 05 dex of solar abundance; for T_e = 5770 K, the solar color is B-V= 0. 652 +/- 0. 002 (s. e. m.). From over 500 cool dwarfs between [Fe/H] = - 0. 5 and + 0. 5, Delta(B-V) /Delta[Fe/H] at fixed M_V = 0. 213 +/- 0. 005, with a very weak dependence upon the adopted main sequence slope with B-V at a given [Fe/H]. At Hyades metallicity this translates into Delta M_V/Delta[Fe/H] at fixed B-V = 0. 98 +/- 0. 02, midway between the range of values empirically derived from smaller and/or less homogeneous samples and model isochrones. From field stars of similar metallicity, the Hyades ([Fe/H] = + 0. 13) with no reddening has (m-M) _ 0 = 3. 33 +/- 0. 02 and M 67, with E(B-V) = 0. 041, A_V = 3. 1 E(B-V), and [Fe/H] = 0. 00, has (m-M) _ 0 = 9. 71 +/- 0. 02 (s. e. m), where the errors quoted refer to internal errors alone. At the extreme end of the age and metallicity scale, with E(B-V) = 0. 125 +/- 0. 025 and [Fe/H] = + 0. 39 +/- 0. 06, comparison of the <b>fiducial</b> <b>relation</b> for NGC 6791 to 19 field stars with (B-V) above 0. 90 and [Fe/H] = + 0. 25 or higher, adjusted to the metallicity of NGC 6791, leads to (m-M) _ 0 = 13. 07 +/- 0. 09, internal and systematic errors included.

40|$|We present {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations of}} galaxies hosting Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory). Combining GALEX UV data with optical and near infrared photometry, we employ stellar population synthesis techniques to measure SN Ia host galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and reddening due to dust. We reinforce the key role of GALEX UV data in deriving accurate estimates of galaxy SFRs and dust extinction. Optical spectra of SN Ia host galaxies are fitted simultaneously for their stellar continua and emission lines fluxes, {{from which we}} derive high precision redshifts, gas-phase metallicities, and Halpha-based SFRs. With these data we show that SN Ia host galaxies present tight agreement with the <b>fiducial</b> galaxy mass-metallicity <b>relation</b> from SDSS for stellar masses log(M_*/M_Sun) > 8. 5 where the relation is well-defined. The star-formation activity of SN Ia host galaxies {{is consistent with a}} sample of comparable SDSS field galaxies, though this comparison is limited by systematic uncertainties in SFR measurements. Our analysis indicates that SN Ia host galaxies are, on average, typical representatives of normal field galaxies. Comment: 25 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} first {{pointed out}} by Tully and Fisher between the luminosity of spiral galaxies and their maximum rotation velocity, {{as measured by the}} 21 cm line-width, continues {{to be one of the}} best methods available to measure relative distances. At infrared wavelengths, the observational scatter about this relation is typically 0. 35 to 0. 50 magnitudes, permitting relative distance estimates with an accuracy of about 20 percent. The Malmquist bias in a magnitude-limited sample is 1. 38 σ ², and while the solution to the general problem is complex, it is clear that reducing the scatter about the Tully-Fisher relation by even a factor of two would make a large difference in our ability to determine the local velocity field from distances and velocities of individual galaxies. In this dissertation we discuss the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation at infrared wavelengths, and look for ways to reduce that dispersion through the inclusion of additional observational parameters. The data for this study are derived from a CCD survey of 244 spiral galaxies in twenty clusters falling in the redshift range 3, 000 to 11, 000 km s⁻¹. From surface brightness profiles and elliptical aperture photometry, we obtained isophotal and total magnitudes at B, R, and I, isophotal diameters, mean and nuclear surface brightnesses, and a concentration parameter indicative of the bulge-to-disk ratio. These quantities were then combined with colors and HI-content measures taken from the literature in a search for correlations with Tully-Fisher residuals. None of the trial second-parameters resulted in a substantial decrease in the scatter about the <b>fiducial</b> Tully-Fisher <b>relation.</b> An examination of the properties of the cluster samples shows that many of the clusters exhibit considerable substructure. While it is possible that the implied depth effects are important to the scatter about the magnitude/line-width relation, calculated lower limits to the dispersion in depth turn out to be rather small...|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} final results of the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We {{summarize}} our method, the results and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give {{the implications of these}} results for cosmology. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the <b>fiducial</b> period-luminosity (PL) <b>relations,</b> (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC 2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km/sec/Mpc) of H 0 = 71 +/- 2 (random) +/- 6 (systematic) (type Ia supernovae), 71 +/- 2 +/- 7 (Tully-Fisher relation), 70 +/- 5 +/- 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), 72 +/- 9 +/- 7 (type II supernovae), and 82 +/- 6 +/- 9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with 3 different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H 0 = 72 +/- 8. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring the Hubble constant. Comment: Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the dark matter haloes in which they reside is key to constraining how black hole fuelling is triggered and regulated. Previous efforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering, weak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modelling. In practice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, {{no matter how they}} are identified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation function whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. In this work, we show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparison of the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of AGN hosts to the <b>fiducial</b> stellar-to-halo mass <b>relation</b> (SHMR) derived for all galaxies, irrespective of nuclear activity. Our technique exploits the fact that the global SHMR can be measured with much higher accuracy than any statistic derived from AGN samples alone. Using 382 moderate luminosity X-ray AGN at z < 1 from the COSMOS field, we report the first measurements of weak gravitational lensing from an X-ray-selected sample. Comparing this signal to predictions from the global SHMR, we find that, contrary to previous results, most X-ray AGN do not live in medium size groups – nearly half reside in relatively low mass haloes with M 200 b ∼ 1012. 5 M⊙. The AGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all galaxies but with a lower normalization – the fraction of haloes with AGN in our sample is a few per cent. The number of AGN satellite galaxies scales as a power law with host halo mass with a power-law index α = 1. By highlighting the relatively ‘normal’ way in which moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy haloes, our results suggest that the environmental signature of distinct fuelling modes for luminous quasars compared to moderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed...|$|R
