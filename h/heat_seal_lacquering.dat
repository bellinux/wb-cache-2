40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> {{behavior}} of novel polyethylene-based nanocomposite films was investigated, as they re-late to flexible packaging of fresh-cut vegetables, processed foods and biomedical devices. Appropriately designed sealant nanocomposites, which include dispersed montmorillonite nanofillers and ethyl vinyl ac-etate copolymer, produce a hermetic but peelable <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> across a broad, 30 – 40 ◦C, range of <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> temperatures, outperforming optimized commercial polyethylene-based sealants that achieve peelable seals {{in a much}} narrower <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> temperature range, of less than 15 ◦C. Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to a general easy-open/peelable character of <b>heat</b> <b>seals,</b> which is: (a) independent of sealing conditions and apparatus — ranging from long dwell times at very high sealing pressures to very short heat impulses at very low sealing pressures; (b) markedly independent of {{the opposite side of}} the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> — for example, when sealed on itself, on unfilled sealant, or on high density polyethylene; and (c) rather insensitive to for-mulation variations of the sealant — for example, variations of the polyethylene of the ethyl vinyl acetate type and concentration, and of nanofiller loading. Insights from observations of the fracture seal surfaces by infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that the underlying mechanism of this behavior is related to a synergistic effect of the ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer and the montmorillonite clay nanofiller...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Acrylic latex {{polymers}} {{which are}} widely used as backcoatings for fabrics dielectrically <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> in automotive interior trim constructions can cause arcing on nylon-containing fabrics during <b>heat</b> <b>sealing.</b> Arcing causes fabric charring. Most nylon fabrics, because of their polar and hydroscopic nature, are prone to arcing. A latex backcoating can aggravage this problem further. This talk discusses several new acrylic latexes developed for arc resistant backcoatings for nylon fabric, presenting comparative dielec-tric <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> data on several nylon-containing fabrics. The role of the nonwoven plumper pad adhesive (usually a preplasticized PVC latex) used in the interior trim construc-tions is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrated}} on studying <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> paper with polymer film by hot-bar sealing. The objectives included {{learning more about}} the relationship of the materials and how they behave in different <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> conditions. Also some methods were tested out for <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> samples to find out if they would provide useful information because one interest was to find new methods for testing. Theory part introduces flexible paper-polymer films packages that are opened by peeling. Also the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> process and the method to measure seal strength have been presented. Adhesion theories that are the most applicable considering <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> have been introduced. It was found that sealing temperature affects seal properties greatly. When certain level of pressure is applied, it doesn’t affect seal strength notably anymore if it’s increased. Correlation between seal strength and fibre amount index was found not to be straight forward. Results suggested that pressure effects on the peel characteristics so that high pressure possibly makes the paper surface more compact and molten polymer doesn’t flow into valleys and voids of paper’s surface thus giving smaller fibre amount index. With profilometer it was possible to obtain differences to the surface roughness for samples <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> with different parameter and the images showed clearly the fibres that were pointing out of paper surface and attached to polymer film. When comparing manual peeling to using an instrument it was found that with the instrument fibre amount index levels were higher but standard deviations were not smaller...|$|R

40|$|In this study, polyamide-aluminum foil-polypropylene (PA-Al-PP) {{composite}} {{films with}} different orientation {{status of the}} PP layer were prepared, and their morphology, tensile, peeling and <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior were studied. The comparative study of tensile and fracture behaviors of single-layer film of PA, Al and PP, {{as well as the}} composite films of PA-Al, PP-Al and PA-Al-PP revealed that in PA-Al-PP composite film, the PA layer with the highest tensile strength can share the tensile stress from the Al layer during stretching, while the PP layer with the lowest tensile strength can prevent further development of the small cracks on boundary of the Al layer during stretching. Moreover, the study of <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior suggested that both the orientation status and the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> conditions were important factors in determining the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength (HSS) and failure behavior of the sample. Four failure types were observed, and a clear correspondence between HSS and failure types was found.

40|$|Sequences of {{operations}} on packaging machines {{can be described}} as a series of basic operations. Such basic operations are, for instance, the transport of the packaging material through the machine, the moulding of the packaging material to the package, by folding for example, the dosing and filling up of the products to be packed and the closing of the filled package, for instance by <b>heat</b> <b>sealing.</b> There are several characteristic basic operations for every type of packaging machine. The aim is to find out the relevant properties of the packaging materials for the several basic operations and to determine ranges of numerical values for them wherein maximum undisturbed processing is guaranteed. This is demonstrated on the vertical pouch form-fill seal machine. The tightness of the closures, which are mostly attainable by <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> in the case of plastic films, laminated material and plastic coated papers, is of great importance for maintaining the quality of the packed product. The quality of the heat-sealed seams depends on temperature, pressure and dwell time at the heat-sealing process on the one hand, and on the sealing procedure and on the construction of the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> devices, especially of the surface profile, on the other hand.
