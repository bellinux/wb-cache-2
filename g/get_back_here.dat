[...] Damon told USA Today: [...] "If we are going to win the World Series, it's better to beat the Yankees to get there. Otherwise, {{everybody}} will say, 'Well, you didn't have to face the Yankees.' I think we have the best team, so I hope the best team wins. But the Yankees are no slouches. We know that [...] Sheffield can hit every single pitch thrown to him." ...|$|E

Well, look here, {{there is no}} hurry {{for a few days}} about your {{starting}} <b>back</b> to Bridger. <b>Here</b> we are now, nearly at the end of December. It will take you a month to get there, say another fortnight to go on to Salt Lake City and register your claim and <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Bridger, then it would be a month <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again; that would take you to the middle of March.

I had {{to sit back and}} listen to people doubt me and wait my turn to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> out <b>here</b> and show {{everybody}} what I'm made out of and man! I love my wife, I love my wife. Ah, this is a tough sport guys. This is a tough sport. You gotta have thick skin. The family has to have thick skin. Your coaches have to have thick skin.

6000|$|... "Well, Lumley," [...] said I, at length, [...] "your first {{suggestion}} I {{meet with}} the reply that the consent of parents is not ignored among Indians, and that Waboose's mother is an Indian of so high-minded and refined a nature--partly acquired, no doubt, from her husband--that she will never consent to give her daughter to such a man; such a brute, I might say, considering what he attempted. As to Waboose herself, her father's gentle nature in her secures her from such a misfortune; and as to her being carried off--well, I don't think any savages would be bold enough to try to carry off anything from the grip of Peter Macnab, and when we <b>get</b> her <b>back</b> <b>here</b> we will know how to look after her." ...|$|R

But as I said on the in lap I am just so proud of the guys, as I go into the factory and I see how hard everyone is pushing. Everyone wants to win just as much as I do and they never gave up. They have never given up which is something very rare to see in such a large group of people. I am very, very proud of them. We didn’t expect to win this weekend. Undoubtedly we have caught up quite a bit but we never felt we had the pace to win. But the car felt fantastic and it is incredibly special to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> up <b>here,</b> not only on the podium, but to get a win. It is amazing." ...|$|R
