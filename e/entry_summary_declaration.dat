40|$|As {{more and}} more people are expressing their {{opinions}} on the web in the form of weblogs (or blogs), research on the blogosphere is gaining popularity. As the outcome of this research, different natural language tools such as querybased opinion summarizers have been developed to mine and organize opinions on a particular event or entity in blog entries. However, the variety of blog posts and the informal style and structure of blog entries pose many difficulties for these natural language tools. In this paper, we identify and categorize errors which typically occur in opinion summarization from blog entries and compare blog <b>entry</b> <b>summaries</b> with traditional news text summaries based on these error types to quantify the differences between these two genres of texts for the purpose of summarization. For evaluation, we used summaries from participating systems of the TAC 2008 opinion summarization track and updated summarization track. Our results show that some errors are much more frequent to blog entries (e. g. topic irrelevant information) compared to news texts; while other error types, such as content overlap, seem to be comparable. These findings can be used to prioritize these error types and give clear indications as to where we should put effort to improve blog summarization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Systematic reviews are {{important}} for decision makers. They offer many potential benefits but are often written in technical language, are too long, and do not contain contextual details which make them hard to use for decision-making. There are many organizations that develop and disseminate derivative products, such as evidence summaries, from systematic reviews for different populations or subsets of decision makers. This systematic review aimed to (1) assess the effectiveness of evidence summaries on policymakers’ use of the evidence and (2) identify the most effective summary components for increasing policymakers’ use of the evidence. We present {{an overview of the}} available evidence on systematic review derivative products. Methods We included studies of policymakers at all levels as well as health system managers. We included studies examining any type of “evidence summary,” “policy brief,” or other products derived from systematic reviews that presented evidence in a summarized form. The primary outcomes were the (1) use of systematic review summaries in decision-making (e. g., self-reported use of the evidence in policymaking and decision-making) and (2) policymakers’ understanding, knowledge, and/or beliefs (e. g., changes in knowledge scores about the topic included in the summary). We also assessed perceived relevance, credibility, usefulness, understandability, and desirability (e. g., format) of the summaries. Results Our database search combined with our gray literature search yielded 10, 113 references after removal of duplicates. From these, 54 were reviewed in full text, and we included six studies (reported in seven papers) as well as protocols from two ongoing studies. Two studies assessed the use of evidence summaries in decision-making and found little to no difference in effect. There was also little to no difference in effect for knowledge, understanding or beliefs (four studies), and perceived usefulness or usability (three studies). Summary of findings tables and graded <b>entry</b> <b>summaries</b> were perceived as slightly easier to understand compared to complete systematic reviews. Two studies assessed formatting changes and found that for summary of findings tables, certain elements, such as reporting study event rates and absolute differences, were preferred as well as avoiding the use of footnotes. Conclusions Evidence summaries are likely easier to understand than complete systematic reviews. However, their ability to increase the use of systematic review evidence in policymaking is unclear.

40|$|Aberrant {{keratinocyte}} differentiation {{is considered}} to be a key mechanism in the onset of hyperproliferative dermatological diseases, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC). It is, therefore, vital to understand what drives keratinocytes to develop such pathological phenotypes. The role of calcium in keratinocyte differentiation is uncontested but the mechanisms controlling calcium-induced differentiation have yet to be completely elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the role of calcium-permeable TRPC channels in human keratinocyte differentiation and BCC, using a combination of molecular and cell biology approaches, involving electrophysiology and Ca(2 +) -imaging, on the HaCaT cell line, primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes, and BCC cells. We demonstrated that TRPC 1 /TRPC 4 channel expression was important for keratinocyte differentiation, as knocking out these channels (by siRNA strategy) prevented the induction of Ca(2 +) -induced differentiation. TRPC 1 /TRPC 4 -mediated calcium entry and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) content increased significantly in differentiated keratinocytes. However, the failure of BCC cells to differentiate was related to a lack of TRPC channel expression and calcium <b>entry.</b> In <b>summary,</b> our data demonstrate that TRPC 1 and TRPC 4 channels are key elements in keratinocyte Ca(2 +) homeostasis and differentiation and may therefore be responsible for skin pathologies.
