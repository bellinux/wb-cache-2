5000|$|Telman Zeynalov, {{president}} of the National Center of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Forecasting,</b> {{said in an interview}} that the entire area from Arran (i.e. the great triangle of land, lowland in the east but rising to mountains in the west, formed by the junction of the rivers Kura and Aras) to Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, would be flooded if Mingachevir dam was destroyed. In his words, it would lead to a [...] "large-scale environmental disaster." [...] Zeynalov added that the Armenian side should be cautious because the flooding [...] "would affect both sides" [...] and most of Armenian-controlled Karabakh would also be flooded. The latter claim was rejected by Armenian analyst Hrant Melik-Shahnazaryan who stated that the waters of the Mingachevir reservoir cannot possibly reach the highlands of Karabakh.|$|E
50|$|On July 11, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) placed much of East China under {{a yellow}} alert, {{the second level}} of a four-tier warning system. Additionally, Fujian was placed under an orange alert, the second-highest level of warning. A {{national}} early disaster warning was also put in place that day, with local authorities across the country asked to be on duty around-the-clock. Residents in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang were advised to prepare for heavy rains capable of producing floods and landslides. In Fujian, more than 304,000 people were evacuated prior to Soulik's arrival. Public transportation was brought to a standstill in some areas and 142 flights from Fuzhou Changle International Airport were canceled. The National Marine <b>Environmental</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Center also issued a top-level maritime for areas over the southern East China Sea, with waves expected to reach 6 to 10 m. Additionally, roughly 5,500 soldiers were dispatched to 18 counties in Fujian to assist in possible rescue efforts.|$|E

30|$|Another {{reason for}} not using <b>environmental</b> <b>forecasts</b> which arose in discussions with both {{hydrological}} and ocean rig stakeholders was the multifaceted nature of decisions. When a decision depends on many variables, reducing uncertainty in {{just one of the}} variables may not be that valuable, even if reducing uncertainty in all of them might be. Such an example impacts the subject of the current study since the value of an improved forecast for just one of two uncertain inputs to a decision is often hard to realize. Even if the forecast is important, quantifying its value to the decision can be very difficult, especially after the fact.|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Fifth <b>Environmental</b> <b>Forecast,</b> we assessed the magnitude of the potential burden of disease attributable to noise exposure using the following: (i) morbidity data, (ii) noise exposure distributions of the Dutch population, and (iii) dose-response relationships. We carried out additional calculations using a Chronic disease model to examine the influence of assessed the prevalent cases on the disease burden in terms of DALYs. An extensive sensitivity analysis was also carried out. Because of noise exposure, a range of effects varying in clinical gravity was assessed. It is expected {{that as a result of}} the increasing noise levels disease burden will increase. Sensitivity analysis showed that the uncertainty of the dose-response-relations is the main cause of variation...|$|R
50|$|On October 3, the National Marine <b>Environmental</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Center of China {{upgraded}} the rainstorm {{alert for}} Typhoon Nalgae to the orange level, the second-highest alert {{level in the}} country's four-level rainstorm alert system, reporting {{that a number of}} tidal stations off the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian would experience tides beyond the ordinary safety levels. The agency asked all the tourists heading to typhoon-hit provinces to remain flexible with their itineraries as several air and ship may be either cancelled or indefinitely delayed when the typhoon comes ashore. China's flood control authority also took action by sending three emergency teams to Hainan, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in order to implement increased preventative measures against typhoon-based natural disasters after announcing a level IV emergency response to Nalgae. According to the agency, Nalgae, the third tropical cyclone to have affected the region in a short span of just 10 days, can bring about many problems, as strong winds and heavy rain had caused severe damage to some water projects in those regions and consumed large quantities of flood control materials. They said that when Nalgae approaches, it will be more difficult to organize disaster prevention work. Also, tourists were quickly moving into the southern coastal areas to enjoy the week-long public holiday.|$|E
5000|$|On August 6, as the typhoon approached, over 200,000 {{people were}} {{evacuated}} from low-lying areas; however, although 140 more flights were cancelled the typhoon {{was no longer}} expected to directly impact the nation. The meteorological agency announced that heavy rain and strong winds would affect the nation for three days, beginning on 7 August. Some 11,000 rescue workers in 120 teams were mobilized {{to respond to the}} storm and protect as many people as possible. The National Marine <b>Environmental</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Center issued a red alert (the highest alert in the four-level high-wave warning system) as the system swept across the East China Sea at typhoon strength. Waves as high as 9-11 meters were expected throughout the East China Sea. Shanghai railway authorities established an emergency response plan: if Muifa's winds were less than 62 km/h in Shanghai, the subway would be manually operated at low speed. If winds were greater than 89 km/h, the trains would be cancelled. Both airports in Shanghai were closed, and all outdoor events were also cancelled or postponed. As the system neared land, the Shanghai government urged residents to stay indoors with first-aid kits and emergency supplies. A message from the federal government of the United States to Americans living in China advised them to [...] "stock up on emergency supplies of food, water, and cash in case of storm-related power outages".|$|E

40|$|Dynamical Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) (Aussem 1994) are a {{class of}} fully {{recurrent}} networks obtained by modeling synapses as autoregressive filters. By virtue of their internal dynamic, these networks approximate the underlying law governing the time series by a system of nonlinear difference equations of internal variables. They therefore provide history-sensitive forecasts without having to be explicitly fed with external memory. The model is trained by a local and recursive error propagation algorithm called temporal-recurrent-backpropagation. The efficiency of the procedure benefits from the exponential decay of the gradient terms backpropagated through the adjoint network. We assess the predictive ability of the DRNN model with meteorological and astronomical time series recorded around the candidate observation sites for the future VLT telescope.
