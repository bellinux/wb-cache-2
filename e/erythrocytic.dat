5|$|After a {{potential}} dormant {{period in the}} liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the <b>erythrocytic</b> stage of the life cycle.

5|$|Malaria {{infection}} develops via two phases: {{one that}} involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (<b>erythrocytic</b> phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically {{for a period of}} 8–30 days.|$|E
2500|$|Plasmodium falciparum {{erythrocyte}} {{membrane protein}} 1 (PfEMP1) {{is a family}} of proteins present on the membrane surface of red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) that are infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. PfEMP1 is synthesized during the parasite's blood stage (<b>erythrocytic</b> schizogony) inside the RBC, during which the clinical symptoms of falciparum malaria are manifested. Acting as both an antigen and adhesion protein, it is thought to {{play a key role}} in the high level of virulence associated with P. falciparum. It was discovered in 1984 when it was reported that infected RBCs had unusually large-sized cell membrane proteins, and these proteins had antibody-binding (antigenic) properties. An elusive protein, its chemical structure and molecular properties were revealed only after a decade, in 1995. It is now established that there is not one but a large family of PfEMP1 proteins, genetically regulated (encoded) by a group of about 60 genes called var. Each P. falciparum is able to switch on and off specific var genes to produce a [...] functionally different protein, rendering evasion from the host's immune system. RBCs carrying PfEMP1 on their surface stick to endothelial cells, which facilitates further binding with uninfected RBCs (through the processes of sequestration and rosetting), ultimately helping the parasite to both spread to other RBCs as well as bringing about the fatal symptoms of P. falciparum malaria.|$|E

50|$|The {{parasite}} is intra <b>erythrocytic,</b> ameoboid, oval or pyriform in shape. There are no vacuoles or reticulation in the cytoplasm. The nucleus has {{two or more}} chromatin granules. The parasite has {{a single}} membrane.|$|E
50|$|In this stage, many {{thousands}} of merozoites are produced in each schizont. As the merozoites are released, they invade erythrocytes and initiate the <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle, where the parasite digests hemoglobin to obtain amino acids for protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Novyella is a {{subgenus}} of {{the genus}} Plasmodium - {{all of which are}} parasites. The subgenus was created in 1963 by Corradetti et al.. Species in this subgenus infect birds. It unites the avian malaria parasites with small <b>erythrocytic</b> meronts and elongated gametocytes.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{protozoa}} has a tissue phase and an <b>erythrocytic</b> (red blood cell) phase. The organism goes through asexual reproduction phase that is called schizogony which occurs in the mononuclear phagocytic cells. In the tissue phase the macrophage cells that are infected often clog venules in organs such as the liver, spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes. It is this phase {{that is associated with}} clinical disease if the schizonts are numerous. Schizonts next form merozoites that break out of the macrophage cells and infect the red blood cells (erythrocytes). The <b>erythrocytic</b> disease is not as important for clinical disease but is often used to diagnose C. felis because you can see piroplasms (erythrocytes that have phagocytized merozoites) on a peripheral blood smear under the microscope.|$|E
50|$|Pamaquine is {{effective}} against the hypnozoites of the relapsing malarias (P. vivax and P. ovale); and unlike primaquine, {{it is also}} very effective against the <b>erythrocytic</b> stages of all four human malarias. One small clinical trial of pamaquine as a causal prophylactic was disappointing (whereas primaquine is an extremely effective causal prophylactic).|$|E
50|$|Following the <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle, which {{lasts for}} seventy two hours on average, six to {{fourteen}} merozoites are released to reinvade other erythrocytes. Finally, {{some of the}} merozoites develop into either micro- or macrogametocytes. The two types of gametocytes are taken into the mosquito during feeding and the cycle is repeated. There are no animal reservoirs for P. malariae.|$|E
50|$|Complex {{patterns}} of alternative splicing in the regulatory domain, {{giving rise to}} different isoforms of ankyrin 1 have been described, however, the precise functions of the various isoforms are not known. Alternative polyadenylation accounting for the different sized <b>erythrocytic</b> ankyrin 1 mRNAs, has also been reported. Truncated muscle-specific isoforms of ankyrin 1 resulting from usage of an alternate promoter have also been identified.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine, proguanil, mefloquine, and {{doxycycline}} are suppressive prophylactics. This {{means that}} they are only effective at killing the malaria parasite once it has entered the <b>erythrocytic</b> stage (blood stage) of its life cycle, and therefore have no effect until the liver stage is complete. That is why these prophylactics must continue to be taken for four weeks after leaving the area of risk.|$|E

50|$|In man: <b>erythrocytic</b> stage (in the blood):Merozoites are {{unleashed}} {{into the}} blood stream to infect erythrocytes constituting one asexual cycle of infection of the erythrocytes. Within the red blood cells some merozoites develop into trophozoites, which in turn mature into schizonts that rupture to release merozoites, while others develop into microgametocytes or macrogametocytes. These gametocytes remain in the blood to be ingested by mosquitoes.|$|E

5000|$|One way to {{diagnose}} C. felis is by taking blood and performing a peripheral blood smear {{to look for}} the <b>erythrocytic</b> piroplasms. [...] The <b>erythrocytic</b> piroplasms are usually shaped like signet rings and are 1 to 1.5 µm. [...] Not all cats that are infected will have the piroplasms on their blood smear, especially if they are early in disease course. Another method of diagnosing infection in sick cats is to take needle aspirates of affected organs and find the schizonts inside mononuclear cells in the tissues; examination of tissue is also useful for the diagnosis after cats have died. Blood samples can be sent away for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to confirm infection. Other diseases that might resemble cytauxzoonosis should be ruled out. A major rule-out for C. felis is Mycoplasma haemofelis (formerly known as Haemobartonella felis); clinical signs can be similar to cytuaxzoonosis and the organism may be confused on the peripheral smear. [...] Because it causes similar signs in outdoor cats during the spring and summer, tularemia is another disease the veterinarian may want to rule out.|$|E
50|$|Pyrimethamine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of uncomplicated malaria. It is particularly useful in cases of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains when combined with sulfadoxine. It acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite thus preventing the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thereby halting the processes of DNA replication, cell division and reproduction. It acts primarily on the schizonts during the <b>erythrocytic</b> phase, and nowadays is only used in concert with a sulfonamide.|$|E
50|$|Sulfadoxine and {{sulfamethoxypyridazine}} {{are specific}} inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway of malaria parasites. They are structural analogs of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and compete with PABA to block its conversion to dihydrofolic acid. Sulfonamides {{act on the}} schizont stages of the <b>erythrocytic</b> (asexual) cycle. When administered alone sulfonamides are not efficacious in treating malaria but co-administration with the antifolate pyrimethamine, most commonly as fixed-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar), produces synergistic effects sufficient to cure sensitive strains of malaria.|$|E
50|$|Cabot {{rings are}} thin, red-violet staining, threadlike strands {{in the shape}} of a loop or figure-8 that are found on rare {{occasions}} in red blood cells (erythrocytes). They are believed to be microtubules that are remnants from a mitotic spindle, and their presence indicates an abnormality in the production of red blood cells.Cabot Rings, considerably rare findings, when present are found in the cytoplasm of red blood cells and in most cases, are caused by defects of <b>erythrocytic</b> production and are not commonly found in the blood circulating throughout the body.|$|E
50|$|Plasmodium knowlesi is {{the sixth}} major human malaria {{parasite}} (following {{the division of}} Plasmodium ovale into 2 subspecies). It may cause severe malaria as indicated by its asexual <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle of about 24 hours, with an associated fever that typically occurs at the same frequency (i.e. the fever is quotidian). This is an emerging infection that was reported {{for the first time}} in humans in 1965. It accounts for up to 70% of malaria cases in certain areas in South East Asia where it is mostly found. This parasite is transmitted by the bite of an Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium knowlesi has health, social and economic consequences for the regions affected by it.|$|E
5000|$|Plasmepsins are a {{class of}} at least 10 enzymes ( [...] and [...] ) {{produced}} by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. There are ten different isoforms of these proteins and ten genes coding them respectively in Plasmodium (Plm I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X and HAP). It {{has been suggested that}} the plasmpesin family is smaller in other human Plasmodium species. Expression of Plm I, II, IV, V, IX, X and HAP occurs in the <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle, and expression of Plm VI, VII, VIII, occurs in the exoerythrocytic cycle. Through their haemoglobin-degrading activity, they are an important cause of symptoms in malaria sufferers. Consequently, this family of enzymes is a potential target for antimalarial drugs.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} with repeated sequences {{is responsible for}} frequent duplication events (which create new genes) and recombination events, at the origin of combination diversity. These peculiar properties are mechanisms that generate diversity at an individual scale and therefore contribute to adaptation of organisms to their environments. For example, in Plasmodium falciparum during interphase of <b>erythrocytic</b> stage, the chromosomic extremities are gathered at the cell nucleus periphery, where they undergo frequent deletion and telomere position effect (TPE). This event in addition to expansion and deletion of subtelomeric repeats, give rise to chromosome size polymorphisms and so, subtelomeres undergo epigenetic and genetic controls. Thanks to the properties of subtelomeres, Plasmodium falciparum evades host immunity by varying the antigenic and adhesive character of infected erythrocytes (see Subtelomeric transcripts).|$|E
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology MicroRNA-223 (miR-223) {{is a short}} RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms. miR-223 is a hematopoietic specific microRNA with crucial functions in myeloid lineage development. It plays {{an essential role in}} promoting granulocytic differentiation [...] while also being associated with the suppression of <b>erythrocytic</b> differentiation. miR-223 is commonly repressed in hepatocellular carcinoma [...] and leukemia. Higher expression levels of miRNA-223 are associated with extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the stomach [...] and recurrent ovarian cancer. In some cancers the microRNA-223 down-regulation is correlated with higher tumor burden, disease aggressiveness, and poor prognostic factors. MicroRNA-223 is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic ischemia.|$|E
50|$|Because P. knowlesi {{takes only}} 24 hours to {{complete}} its <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle, it can rapidly result in {{very high levels}} of parasitemia with fatal consequences. Anyone with a severe and rapidly deteriorating condition should be treated aggressively and urgently as if were infected with falciparum malaria. P. knowlesi responds well to treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. In a clinical study of treatment where response was observed after oral chloroquine was given for three days, and at 24 hours oral primaquine was administered for two consecutive days., {{it was found that}} this regime gave a rapid response with a median time to parasite clearance of three hours. This was more rapid that is found in Plasmodium vivax malaria where the median time to clearance is between six and seven hours.|$|E
5000|$|The NYVAC-Pf7 {{multi-stage}} vaccine {{attempted to}} use different technology, incorporating seven P.falciparum antigenic genes. These {{came from a}} variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called PfSSP2) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the <b>erythrocytic</b> stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using Rhesus monkeys and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, MSP1 and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with P.falciparum. This result has warranted ongoing trials.|$|E
50|$|The food vacuole is the {{specialized}} compartment that degrades hemoglobin during the asexual <b>erythrocytic</b> {{stage of the}} parasite. It is implied that effective drug treatments can be developed by targeting the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole. In a paper published in 1997, Westling et al. focused their attention on the aspartic endopeptidase class of enzymes, simply called plasmepsins. They sought to characterize the specificity for the enzymes cloned from P. vivax and P. malariae. Using substrate specificity studies and inhibitor analysis, {{it was found that}} the plasmepsins for P. malariae and P. vivax showed less specificity than that for P. falciparum. Unfortunately, this means that the development of a selective inhibitor for P. malariae may prove more challenging than the development of one for P. falciparum.Another study by Bruce et al. presented evidence that there may be regular genetic exchange within P. malariae populations. Six polymorphic genetic markers from P. malariae were isolated and analyzed in 70 samples of naturally acquired P. malariae infections from different parts of the world. The data showed a high level of multi-genotypic carriage in humans.|$|E

50|$|Plasmodium malariae {{causes a}} chronic {{infection}} {{that in some}} cases can last a lifetime. The P. malariae parasite has several differences between it and the other Plasmodium parasites, one being that maximum parasite counts are usually low compared to those in patients infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax. The reason for this can be accounted for by the lower number of merozoites produced per <b>erythrocytic</b> cycle, the longer 72-hour developmental cycle (compared to the 48-hour cycle of P. vivax and P. falciparum), the preference for development in older erythrocytes and the resulting earlier development of immunity by the human host.Another defining feature of P. malariae is that the fever manifestations of the parasite are more moderate relative to those of P. falciparum and P. vivax and fevers show quartan periodicity. Along with bouts of fever and more general clinical symptoms such as chills and nausea, the presence of edema and the nephrotic syndrome has been documented with some P. malariae infections. It has been suggested that immune complexes may cause structural glomerular damage and that renal disease may also occur. Although P. malariae alone has a low morbidity rate, it does contribute to the total morbidity caused by all Plasmodium species, as manifested in the incidences of anemia, low birth rate and reduced resistance to other infections.|$|E
