It has salient supply disparity during the harvest and planting season. This condition could cause disadvantages to the stakeholders such as producer, wholesaler, consumer, and government. This paper proposes a buffer stock model under free trade considerations to substitute quantitative restrictions and tariffs by indirect market <b>intervention</b> <b>instrument.</b> The instrument was developed through buffer stock scheme in accordance with warehouse receipt system (WRS) and collateral management system. The public service institution for staple food buffer stock (BLUPP) is proposed as wholesaler’s competitor with main responsibility to ensure price stabilization and availability of staple food. Multi criteria decision making is formulated as single objective a mixed integer non linear programming (MINLP). The result shows that the proposed model {{can be applied to}} solve the distribution problem and can give more promising outcome than its counterpart, the <b>direct</b> market <b>intervention</b> <b>instrument...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Competitive {{markets are}} massive and {{generally}} efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central {{place in the}} management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring <b>direct</b> government <b>intervention</b> through <b>instruments</b> such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates {{that there should be no}} market at all.We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the [...] "third way". The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation's economic and social imperatives.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to analyse unemployment data, so <b>intervention</b> <b>instruments</b> can be improved and the unemployed can exit social security faster. To this end this paper presents a number of data analysis techniques {{that can be used}} to estimate the probability of outflow and the effectiveness of <b>intervention</b> <b>instruments.</b> Firstly classification trees and survival analysis are used to give insight into the influence of features on the chance of outflow. Furthermore the classification trees can also be used to predict the chance of outflow for new clients. We found some features that seem to greatly influence the chance of outflow. Secondly novel matching algorithms are used to create a treatment and comparable control group for four <b>intervention</b> <b>instruments.</b> Survival analysis is then used to analyse the differences between the groups. We conclude that two of the four <b>intervention</b> <b>instruments</b> are significantly better than other <b>intervention</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market and monetary policy, particularly interest rate policy, seems to be inextricable linked, even when <b>direct</b> <b>interventions</b> are fully and immediately sterilized. Looking at them separately in empirical studies may therefore give misleading results. Some research also suggests that <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> and monetary policy changes are more effective when coordinated, highlighting the {{need to look at}} the impact of intervention and interest rate policy on exchange rates in a joint framework. However, most studies looking at the impact of these policy instruments on exchange rate dynamics look at these policy instruments in isolation. This study seeks to close this gap by investigating in a multivariate GARCH framework whether <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> “signals” the future interest rate policy stance of the Central Bank or whether interest rate policy decisions induce interventions designed to “lean against the wind” of exchange rate trends in Jamaica. If the former relation dominates it would suggest that <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> is used to reinforce monetary policy initiatives but if the latter dominates it would suggest that <b>direct</b> <b>interventions</b> are used to resist exchange rate changes generated by fundamentals. In the latter case this may reflects a policy conflict between monetary policy and <b>direct</b> <b>interventions</b> generated by vulnerability to external shocks...|$|R

Therefore, it may be beneficial for parents to combine active mediation with <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> so that they can protect their teens from severe online risks while empowering teens to engage with others online and learn to make good online privacy choices.

Analyze data using descriptive analysis, statistical analysis Pearson Product Moment Correlation for validity test and Cronbach alpha for reliability test. The result show that the r count validity value of nursing diagnosis instruments was 0, 862 and nursing intervention was 0, 911.

40|$|The unique {{contribution}} {{of the current study}} is the understanding of how a third party <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> in a negotiation is perceived regarding its role in helping to overcome judgmental biases of the negotiators. On this account, I developed the present study, derived from the research undertaken for my doctoral dissertation, in order to understand managers’ perceptions on the integrative role of what I call <b>direct</b> third party <b>intervention.</b> The <b>direct</b> third party <b>intervention</b> can be defined as the situation when parties originally external to a negotiation – i. e. the stakeholders in an acquisition negotiation – enter the negotiation with a strong interest in the achievement, implementation and consequences of the agreement. The third party <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> has been found to have an important influence on the perceived creating value level and fairness level in the negotiation process, {{as well as on the}} possibility of reaching a negotiated settlement, by helping in debriefing the situation and by using integrative behavior. This intervention also helped the parties to overcome the fixed-pie error, showed along the negotiation process, which resulted in affecting the perception of fairness. In addition, the vast majority of participants perceived the third party <b>direct</b> <b>intervention</b> as useful and determinant in overcoming judgmental biases, and accepted the mediated agreement...|$|R
