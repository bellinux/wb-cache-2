50|$|Ideally, coal {{breakers}} {{were placed}} {{so that the}} top of the breaking plant was equal to or slightly below the mine mouth so that gravity would move the coal to the breaking plant. Where this was not possible, coal would be hoisted to {{the top of the}} coal breaking plant. A boiler and boilerhouse would be located nearby to provide power for the hoist, moving screens, jigs, and crushers (although in more modern times this is supplied by electricity), along with an engine house (to house the engine for the <b>hoist),</b> <b>pumps</b> and pumphouse (to supply the coal washing machines with water), and headframe (for the hoist). The typical coal breaking plant was often eight or nine stories tall, sometimes rising 150 feet high or more.|$|R

50|$|In 1902 the {{sailing vessel}} Preussen {{was the first}} to assist {{handling}} of sails by making use of steam power without auxiliary engines for propulsion. The steam power was used to drive the winches, <b>hoists</b> and <b>pumps.</b> A similar ship Kruzenshtern, a very large sailing vessel without mechanical assists, had a crew of 257 men, compared to the Preussen, which required only 48 men.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevator}} (US and Canada) or lift (UK, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa) {{is a type}} {{of vertical}} transportation that moves people or goods between floors (levels, decks) of a building, , or other structure. Elevators/lifts are generally powered by electric motors that either drive traction cables and counterweight systems like a <b>hoist,</b> or <b>pump</b> hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack.|$|R
50|$|The large Cornish engines {{brought in}} by the mine owners kept the water pumped out of the mines {{for a few more}} years, but on May 26, 1886, the Grand Central Mine <b>hoist</b> and <b>pumping</b> plant burned. When the price of silver slid to 90 cents an ounce a few months later, the {{remaining}} mines laid off workers. Many residents of Tombstone left. The Bird Cage Theatre closed in 1892.|$|R

50|$|On May 26, 1886, the Grand Central <b>hoist</b> and <b>pumping</b> plant burned. The {{fire was}} so intense that the metal {{components}} of the Cornish engine melted and warped. The headworks of the main mine shaft were also destroyed. Shortly afterward, the price of silver slid to 90 cents an ounce. The mines that remained operational laid off workers. Individuals who had thought about leaving Tombstone when the mine flooding started now took action. The price of silver briefly recovered {{for a while and}} a few mines began producing again, but never at the level reached in the early 1880s.|$|R
5000|$|Development {{was carried}} out from 1906 to 1918. In 1906, J.W. Barton of Gold Reef Company Limited {{discovered}} molybdenum and copper ore with gold and silver values.

2500|$|Founded in 1857, the {{administrative}} office of Alexander Chaplin & Co. was located at 63 Queen Victoria Street, London, England, before being {{taken over by}} Herbert Morris, LTD in 1932. Well known manufacturers, Alex. Chaplin & Co. prided themselves that their products were [...] "always in stock or in progress". Chaplins' produced a range of steam powered industrial products including steam cranes, <b>hoists,</b> locomotives, <b>pumping</b> and winding engines, ship's deck engines and sea water distilling apparatus, used throughout the world during the 19th and 20th century. Chaplin's patent sea water distilling apparatus with steam pump attached for circulating water was a very compact and convenient apparatus, designed for marine use but capable of adaptation for land use as well.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{permanent}} rivers or bodies of water, streams and groundwater, desalinated seawater and very scarce surface water must supply the country's needs. In eastern Arabia and in the Jabal Tuwayq, artesian wells and springs are plentiful. In Al Ahsa a number of large, deep pools are constantly replenished by artesian springs {{as a result of}} underground water from the eastern watershed of the Jabal Tuwayq. Such springs and wells permit extensive irrigation in local oases. In the Hijaz, wells are abundant, and springs are common in the mountainous areas. In Najd and the great deserts, watering places are comparatively fewer and scattered over a wide area. Water must be <b>hoisted</b> or <b>pumped</b> to the surface, and even where water is plentiful, its quality may be poor.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1880s, {{the silver}} mines {{penetrated}} {{the water table}} and the mining companies made significant investments in specialized pumps. A fire in 1886 destroyed the Grand Central <b>hoist</b> and the <b>pumping</b> plant, and it was unprofitable to rebuild the costly pumps. The city nearly became a ghost town, saved only {{because it was the}} Cochise County seat until 1929. The city's population dwindled to a low of 646 in 1910, but grew to 1,380 by 2010. Tombstone has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.|$|R
50|$|O'Hara's Battery {{features}} a narrow stairway (pictured below) {{which leads to}} the door of an underground magazine. A concrete enclosure contains a portion of the shell hoist and surrounds the gun turntable, which provides support to the 9.2 inch gun and rotates it as needed. Large black steel doors in the enclosure provide access to the turntable. A path (pictured below) which leads down from O'Hara's Battery turns up to the nearby Lord Airey's Battery. That pathway {{features a}}n extra gun barrel (pictured below). The tunnel (pictured below) between the engine room and the gun not only provides access, but also stores <b>pumps,</b> <b>hoists,</b> and shells.|$|R
40|$|T {{here was}} a time when the foothillsof California bustled with {{activity}}. The lure of gold, copper and other treasures sent men into the earth in droves, so that it often seemed there was more activity under the ground than at the surface. Tools and machinery were needed to make the mining possible. Stamp mills, <b>hoist</b> works, <b>pumps,</b> ore cars, dredger buckets, rock crushers, and many other types of equipment had to be manufactured. If the mines were to operate, so must a foundry to cast the metal parts and a shop to machine them to final form. And this is where our story begins. Patent drawing for water wheel with signatures. Historic Knight Foundry, in Sutter Creek California, is believed to be the only remaining water powered foundry and machine shop in the United States. Originally formed as Campbell, Hall & Co., the foundry was established in 1873 to better fill the ever growing needs of the Mother Lode mines, and to produce the patented Knight water wheel. Samuel FOUNDRY & MACHINE SHOP OF Knight, a partner with Campbell and HallKNIGHT & CO. SUTTERR CREEK, CAL. Samuel Knight and crew at the beginning of their foundry venture, circa 1895. later bought them out with his new partner George Horne. Knight, a ship’s carpenter, had worked at mine construction sites in Calaveras and Amador counties, where he had begun to develop a more efficient water wheel...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the second step in the project GRUVAN: the site {{inventory}} in operational mines. The main purposes of the inventory are: -          To get {{a clear picture of}} the risks in the different mines. -          To get a clear picture of the protective measures of each mine. -          Optimize the choice of design fires for each mine. The site inventories were conducted through actual visits to the two LKAB mines in Sweden and through e-mail correspondence with LKAB personnel responsible for the different sections and areas. During the inventories, predefined forms for each type of item were used in order to facilitate the work. The following items were examined: -          Combustible materials in general, for example large amounts of wood. -          Vehicles -          Cables -          Fire barriers -          Ventilation systems -          Extinguishing systems   Besides the above items, earlier fires and fire incidents were also examined. As the two LKAB mines are tremendously large with a large amount of equipment etc, only the most common vehicles were listed and examined further. Also, only the sites with the largest amount of cables and other combustible materials were listed.   The following conclusions were made based upon the findings of the inventory: -          With respect to earlier fires and fire incidents for the two LKAB mines, the most common causes and the causes to focus on are: electrical cause, flammable liquid or material on hot surface, hot works and equipment running hot. -          Both the production area and the infrastructure part should be regarded in the future studies as fires are almost identically frequent in both areas. -          When it comes to combustible material in general, the amount of combustibles seems to be more frequent in the Malmberget mine. In the Kiruna mine, the places with wood and conveyor belts seems to be interesting enough for further investigation. Even though self extinguishing conveyor belts means a limited fire in size, the amount of smoke emitted can be quite extensive. Also the storage of tyres at the contractor’s depots could be worthwhile investigating due to the sensitive surroundings. -          Regarding the Malmberget mine, the sites with wood combustibles, tyres and conveyor belts are all interesting for further investigation due to the large amount of combustibles and the surroundings. -          With respect to flammable liquids: - The tank stations in the Kiruna and the Malmberget mine should be looked          into with respect to potential pool fires. - The larger workshops and warehouses in the Kiruna mine and the Malmberget     mine should also be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The crusher levels and draw points in the two mines should be investigated          with respect to spray fires. - The diesel tanks in the main ramps and the production areas should be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The media drifts, distribution levels, shaft <b>hoisting</b> levels and <b>pumping</b> stations    should be investigated with respect to pool fires. -          With respect to fire barriers, as the main ramps of each mine does not contain any fire barriers the impact of a vehicle fire in the main ramp would be interesting to investigate. It would also be interesting to validate the ventilation strategy in the Malmberget mine regarding preventing smoke spread to adjacent compartments. -          With respect to vehicles, all the common heavy vehicles listed in this report would be worthwhile to try to reconstruct a possible fire scenario for each type of vehicle. The reason for this is to have better tools when working on possible scenarios of each mine. -          Regarding cables, all listed sites with a high load of electrical cables would be interesting to investigate. Even though the immediate surroundings are not sensitive, an extensive smoke spread would make a large impact on {{a large portion of the}} mine. -          When looking into the ventilation system of the Kiruna mine, both the mine production area and the infrastructure part should be investigated due to the differences in each system and their surroundings. Also, the difference in systems whether you are below or above level 775 should be considered. The function and impact of oversteering should also be included in the investigations. -          The impact of a ventiflex PVC-tube being burned up on the fire behaviour in a production area should be investigated. The different fire scenarios in a production area depending on the position of the fire with respect to the ventilation should also be investigated. -          One scenario should put the fire right at the end of the intake air tube, other scenarios should be at a certain length interval from the end of the intake air tube. The likelihood of the power cables to the intake and exhaust air fans being burned off should be looked into. The impact on the surroundings should also be investigated. The return air fan capacity should be examined with respect to fires, such as vehicle fires. GRUVA...|$|R
