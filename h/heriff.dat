5000|$|Originally a {{scientist}} {{who worked in the}} same lab as Dr. Crabtree, Schlock first appeared as a walk-on character administering cosmetic tests on Bun-bun, where it appears he lost his left eye and now has to wear an eye patch. He later appeared as an old man from the future of an alternate timeline where K'Z'K had taken over the world. His knowledge helped save the current timeline from that same fate. He is not an out-and-out villain, just incredibly selfish and cowardly. He would occasionally aid the main characters with insider information (having been involved with Hereti Corp entirely against his will) or inflatable technology from the future, but only when threatened with significant bodily harm. Indeed, a recurring gag in the webcomic is that, every time Schlock thinks he is safe from his enemies, Riff appears out of nowhere with a ray gun pointed into his ear (in the [...] "book" [...] Aylee, a disgusted Schlock asks how <b>he(Riff)</b> does that). However, he is a slippery and clever opponent, having gained the better of both Dr. Crabtree and Hereti-Corp by cunning when they were after him. Due to his attempts at cloning Aylee, he knows more about her physiology than anyone else alive. Because the currently active timeline diverged from the one which the old future version of the doctor came from when K'Z'K didn't conquer the world, this Schlock has remained unaffected by the death of his [...] "present-day" [...] self at the hands (and fangs) of Dr. Crabtree and has long been the only one remaining.|$|E
