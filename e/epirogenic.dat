40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Major linear, circular, and arcuate traces were observed on LANDSAT imagery of Missouri. Lineaments plotted {{within the state}} boundaries range from 20 to nearly 500 km in length. Several extend into adjoining states. Lineaments plots indicate a distinct pattern and in general reflect structural features of the Precambrian basement of the platform. Coincidence of lineaments traced from the imagery and known structural features in Missouri is high, thus supporting a causative relation between them. The lineament pattern apparently reveals a fundamental style of the deformation of the intracontinental craton. Dozens of heretofore unknown linear features related to <b>epirogenic</b> movements and deformation of this segment of the continental crust were delineated. Lineaments and mineralization are interrelated in a geometrically classifiable pattern...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{contains}} {{an approach to}} systematize {{the study of the}} State of Paraná coastal plains, {{in the southern part of}} Brazil. It contains in general some geographical and geological data, documented by maps, sketches and photographs. In the initial stage the coastal plain represents a marine ingression, caused by faulting. This ingression penetrated the valleys of a not yet determinated geological landscape. Ended the movement of deeping by faulting begins the <b>epirogenic</b> ascension and building of the barriers and beach ridges. An intensive sedimentation caused the lagoons and bays obstruction. This work refers mainly to t 33 he sedimentary formations and the coastal plains is classified in the following way for the study in consideration to the morphology and origin: Marine sedimentation - shore, barrier and beach ridge; Intermediary sedimentation - mangrove swamps, mud and sand banks and mangrovito; Continental sedimentation - dunes and terrestrial alluvion.

40|$|The Golpazari-Huyuk karst {{system is}} located in the Central Sakarya Basin whose geo-morphologic {{evolution}} is mainly controlled by the Post-Miocene <b>epirogenic</b> continental rise. Drastic change in the drainage pattern and dissection of the carbonate platform were the major consequences of this tectonic movement. Rapid incision of the Sakarya river changed the position of the erosion base which consequently distorted the direction of surface and subsurface flow. The Golpazari and Huyuk plains are two topographically distinct, flat bottomed geomorphic features separated by a carbonate rock relief.

40|$|Conglomerate – the lithified {{equivalent}} of gravel- forms nearly the whole Bakhtyari Formation, and alternates with sandstone and mudstone {{in the upper}} parts of the Aghjari Formation in the Folded Zagros Zone, and hence in the studied region. In addition to some low and high anticlines, the region consists of two elevated synclines reaching to over 3000 meters. The synclines are {{parallel to each other}} and, unlike in most of the Folded Zagros, overhang adjacent anticlines. Polymictic conglomerates form excellent outcrops in the central parts of these synclines. From the viewpoint of its (coarse) clast composition, the Bakhtyari Formation consists of two types of conglomerates: 1. Limestone-Chert Clast-Supported Conglomerate (LCCSC) and 2. Limestone Clast-Supported Conglomerate (LCSC). The chronological and spatial relationships between these conglomerates are not easily determined due to existence of some thrust faults at their approximate boundaries, and it seems that each has its own independent chronological and spatial setting. In the vertical succession, various lithofacies are recognized; their textural characteristics and sedimentary structures specify a non-marine depositional system and are considered "standard " lithofacies of alluvial fans and braided rivers. <b>Epirogenic</b> movements in the region began in the Oligocene, indicated by a chert micro-conglomerate bed at the Jahrum – Asmari Formation boundary. These movements then changed to orogenic ones with the deposition of gravelly alluvium now known as Aghajari (upper parts) and Bakhtyari Formations...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Motion of the {{lithosphere}} over a {{low viscosity}} asthenosphere con-centrates shear and thus energy dissipation in the asthenosphere. This heat source warms the asthenosphere and, in extreme circumstances, {{may lead to}} thermal instabilities. The conditions for thermal stability have been investi-gated by Melosh who supposed that constant stress acted on the plate, and by Yuen & Schubert who assumed constant velocity boundary conditions. In this paper we investigate a simple analytical model which behaves qualita-tively like the more complex systems. This model reproduces the results of Melosh for constant stress and of Yuen & Schubert for constant velocity. The velocity-shear stress characteristic curve for this model shows three branches. The stability of solutions on each branch {{is a function of}} the boundary condi-tions, whether constant stress or constant velocity. The simplicity of the model allows us to investigate stability when neither constant stress nor constant velocity apply and to study the structure of the solutions as these limits are approached. A relation between the velocity of a plate and the driving force is constructed. A loading-line analysis specifies the actual stress and velocity of the plate. Although the solutions are unique for many combinations of the loading-line parameters, there is a region of multiple solutions. These solutions exhibit the characteristics of a ‘cusp catastrophe’; both a low velocity and a high velocity state are stable, while an intermediate state is unstable. Continental lithosphere may lie in this region, leading to <b>epirogenic</b> movements when the plate changes its velocity with respect to the mantle. Oceanic lithosphere almost certainly moves in the low velocity state...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNon-lateritic {{red soils}} cover vast {{areas of the}} {{semiarid}} region of Northeast Brazil, or “sertão”, whereas laterites remain currently scarce in the landscape and are confined to ancient summit surfaces and/or to more humid areas along the coast. The land cover of the Brazilian drylands is dominated by dry deciduous woodland, or “caatinga”, in areas with mean annual rainfall and temperatures of 400 - 800 mm/y and 24 - 26 °C, respectively. According to morphological descriptions and analytical data, the red soils of semiarid Brazil mainly classify as Luvisols (chromic) in the WRB soil correlation system, and Alfisols in the USDA Soil Taxonomy. In all cases, their formation is strongly controlled by clay illuviation, allowing the diagnosis of a Bt (argic) horizon. Contrary to lateritic soils extending over large tracts of tropical South America, the red soils of NE Brazil are high-activity-clay soils with high cation exchange capacity and moderate to high base saturation ratios. The pedogenic interpretation for their development {{is that of a}} fersiallitic pedogenesis, which involves high contents of free iron and the prevalence of 2 : 1 clays in the soil mineral assemblage. In the regional setting, the red fersiallitic soils typically formed above shallow, grus-type weathering mantles developed from crystalline parent rocks, under pedoclimatic conditions of low, but irregular, deep drainage. In many ways, they are very similar to the red, decalcified fersiallitic soils formed on the crystalline shield of dryland peninsular India, but are very different from tropical ferruginous soils of semiarid West Africa developed from lateritic paleoweathering mantles. As in the Indian setting, persistent <b>epirogenic</b> uplift of the Brazilian margin during the Neogene steered the landscape towards the stripping of most of the paleoweathering mantle, favoring the development of a primary fersiallitic pedogenesis under the newly established semi-arid conditions...|$|E
40|$|EN] This paper {{deals with}} the relief {{generation}} in Ourense, an interior territory of the Galicia Country, at NW Spain, after the breakdown of Pangea 200 million years ago. The rupture of supercontinent causes the main effects in the outer part of Galicia, the present coast line and the shelf, but also the inner parts of Galicia where the landscape changes dramatically mainly ruled by fluvial incision connected with uprising, (orogenic, <b>epirogenic,</b> or isostatic origin), or even with eustatic oscillations, that shaped the previous old mesozoic landscape. Various things complicate the correct understanding of Galician geomorphology: 1) the prevalent hercynian structure, (presumably reactivated during the Alpine Orogeny), causes that the epigenic processes, (fluvial, glaciar, marine and etching), acting on Galicia from Mesozoic to present times, produce end forms identified erroneously at the previous literature as tectonic and not as etch forms profiting from lithological or structural contrasts. 2) the common morphotectonic model accepted by all previous researchers establishes {{for the whole of}} Galicia a blocky pattern, (horst and graben like), due to extensional tectonic regime. This model is proved as no longer valid because the Galician tertiary basins, even were described at the past as graben depressions never have this origin. 3) big differences exist between the north and western sides of Galicia that show contrasted tectonic regime: compressional (with forms as the so called raised platforms), at the northern coast border, and extensional (with forms so typical as the Rias), at the western side. The study area is located at the confluence of two tectonic domains where the above mentioned effects are coincidents and specially well showed through different effects: prominent assimetry of fluvial captures (west facing), pronounced river incision and different kinds of tertiary basins: either strike slipe faults (Maceda, Xinzo de Limia, etc), or overslipped by inverse faults, (Quiroga, A Rúa, etc.), or even corresponding with depressions never, (or anywise passively), affected by tectonic movements, (Monforte). The paper include a detailed inventory of surfaces and terrace levels and their incision sequence which allow stablish a relative chronology of geomorphic evolution at this area of NW Spain during meso-cainozoic times...|$|E

The methodology is based on the records preserved in the morphological and sedimentological archives as well as the hydrogeological setting in the study area. According to the suggested model, the present landscape which exhibits a late stage of karstification has evolved in three main phases, after an initial stage attributed to Lower Miocene. The first phase represents karstification of carbonate rocks of Jurassic age at the Huyuk area and the limestone of Paleocene age at the Golpazari area. This region must have been significantly elevated from the karstification (erosion) base. The geomorphologic and drainage setting reveal that the karstification was controlled mainly by major drainage elements in Late Miocene-Early Pliocene. The second phase is characterized by the uplift of the region and the subsequent rapid incision of drainage during the pluvial period thereby the ponors that drained the polje were completely clogged and the polje {{turned out to be a}} lake in late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The third phase consists of a re-arrangement of drainage pattern and related geomorphologic processes mainly controlled by tectonic movements during Early Pleistocene. Consequently, surface drainage started in the Golpazari lake. Meanwhile Sakarya river incised its bed through the fractured carbonate rocks, capturing also the Huyuk depression complex...|$|E
40|$|Sheet 10 of the 1 : 50, 000 {{geological}} {{map series}} of the Geological Institute, Leiden University, is presented accompanied by a survey of structural, stratigraphic and morphologic features. The region includes part of the southern Axial Zone, {{the eastern end of}} the Nogueras Zone and part of the marginal trough adjacent to the south. Formations mapped range in age from Cambro-Ordovician to Pliocene. Detailed lithostratigraphic studies of the Cambro-Ordovician and Devonian rocks enabled correlations to be made with other regions of the Pyrenees. The Hercynian orogeny formed structures of variable shapes and orientation, which, however, have all be ascribed to stress accumulating in a N-S direction causing consecutive deformations. These can, to a certain extent, be correlated with the deformation phases known in other regions of the Axial Zone to the north. A first phase formed the largest folds of an order of 20 km down to less than 1 km wide. The slaty cleavage is generally parallel to the bedding and may possibly be related to this phase, in which case it is to be interpreted as a “concentric cleavage”. Second phase structures, generally characterized by an axial plane crenulation cleavage, indicate further compression. Temporary relief of the main stress after the first and second phases thought to be a result of accelerated strain rates due to folding, gave rise to cross folds and cascade folds. Gravity sliding of unstable structures in Devonian rocks from the Rabassa dome into the Arcabell syncline and Segre area, resulted in thick accumulations of Devonian material in these depressions. Strong deviations from the general E-W strike of first and second phase structures {{in the eastern part of}} the Orri dome and in the Segre unit are attributed to the influence of an inferred infrastructure rise thought to exist below the Orri dome. <b>Epirogenic</b> movements along the northern border of the marginal trough, were particularly important during the Permian and Cretaceous. The Devonian massif of the Monsech de Tost, amidst post-Hercynian deposits in the Nogueras Zone, is interpreted as a Hercynian gravity structure upthrusted during the Pyrenean (Middle Alpine) deformation. The Pedraforca structure is also explained as an upthrusted block. Later Alpine movements during the Neogene formed grabens in the Segre valley...|$|E
