40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new solid-state welding technology invented at The Welding Institute of UK in 1991. It is versatile and has been widely adopted to join various materials. There has been strong research activity on revealing the details of the material flow pattern in the nugget zone induced by <b>the</b> conventional <b>shoulder</b> tool. However, there is insufficient understanding on the aspects of <b>the</b> scroll <b>shoulder</b> tool design and <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone formation utilizing this type of tool. The major objective {{of this study was to}} conduct experiments, analyse results and then reveal <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone forming mechanism for <b>the</b> scroll <b>shoulder</b> tool. <b>The</b> method used was to identify the flow pattern in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone using a ‘marker insert’ technique, and then to suggest the forming mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone based on the obtained flow pattern; although the ‘marker insert’ technique has never been used to study <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone flow pattern induced by <b>the</b> scroll <b>shoulder</b> tool. Experiments were conducted to examine the thick sections 6061 aluminium ‘marker insert’ welds, which were welded using a scroll shoulder tool at a range of welding parameters. These were followed by quantifying the mass of the accumulated work piece material within the scroll groove (pick up material-PUM), evaluating the effect of welding parameters on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone formation, and documenting <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone flow pattern. The major finding was that there is a simple banded structure which forms in a layer to layer manner in the bottom portion of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone, but it disappears in the top portion of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone. Accordingly, the forming mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone for <b>the</b> scroll <b>shoulder</b> tool was suggested as follows. Firstly, the tool pin is plunged into the work piece; the work piece material is extruded by the pin and pushed up into the scroll groove forming the PUM. Secondly, after <b>the</b> tool <b>shoulder</b> is plunged into the work piece to a certain depth, the scroll groove is fully filled up with the PUM. Finally, during the forward movement of the tool, the central portion of PUM is driven downward by the root portion of the pin and then detaches from the pin (tip portion) in a layer to layer manner. It has also found that the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone varies with a thicker on the advancing side than on the retreating side, and there is a positive linear relationship between the mass of PUM and the weld quality. This study has revealed for the first time the forming mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone, and has improved the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone formation using a scroll shoulder tool. It is recommended that a ‘shoulder-breaking’ technique is developed to break <b>the</b> rotating <b>shoulder</b> suddenly and hence embed it into the work piece during FSW, in which a real-time shoulder-work piece couple could be produced for a better three-dimensional examination of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> flow zone...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{position}} {{sense of}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint is important during reaching. Objective. To examine {{the existence of}} additional competence of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{with regard to the}} ability to measure extracorporeal space, through a novel approach, using <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> proprioceptive rehabilitation tool (SPRT), during reaching. Design. Observational case-control study. Methods. We examined 50 subjects: 25 healthy and 25 with impingement syndrome with a mean age [years] of 64. 52 +/- 6. 98 and 68. 36 +/- 6. 54, respectively. Two parameters were evaluated using the SPRT: the integration of visual information and the proprioceptive afferents of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> (Test 1) and the discriminative proprioceptive capacity of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> with <b>the</b> subject blindfolded (Test 2). These tasks assessed the spatial error (in centimeters) by <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint in reaching movements on the sagittal plane. Results. <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> had proprioceptive features that allowed it to memorize a reaching position and reproduce it (error of 1. 22 [*]cm to 1. 55 [*]cm in healthy subjects). This ability was lower in the impingement group, with a statistically significant difference compared to the healthy group (p < 0. 05 by Mann-Whitney test).
