40|$|The {{lionfish}} (Pterois volitans) is {{a successful}} invasive predator with large impacts on native fish populations in the western Atlantic. Lionfish predation may affect competition between prey species so {{it is important to}} understand whether lionfish display preferences between prey species. I investigated lionfish and native <b>graysby</b> grouper prey preference between prey species and prey size using two closely-related and potentially competitive prey species, the fairy basslet and blackcap basslet. In paired choice tests in aquaria, I recorded the first basslet hunted, total number of strikes, and total time spent hunting on each basslet as quantifications of preference. Lionfish initially hunted fairy basslet while <b>graysby</b> initially hunted blackcap basslet but neither predator displayed any preference between species in number of strikes or time spent hunting. Across all variables, lionfish preference shifted from small to large basslets as lionfish size increased, consistent with being a gape-limited predator, while <b>graysby</b> of all sizes tested preferred only large basslets. Brighter coloration and higher activity level of fairy basslet may have influenced lionfish initial preference but it is unclear why <b>graysby</b> initially hunted blackcap basslet. Lionfish initial preference may alter competition between the two basslet species if initial preference leads to increased fairy basslet mortality...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species can}} {{severely}} disrupt biological communities through {{their interactions with}} native organisms, yet {{little is known about}} the response of marine predators to the establishment of a competitive invasive fish. In the western Atlantic, invasive Indo-Pacific lionfishes (Pterois spp.) may represent a novel competitor to several commercially and ecologically important native species. However, there is a scarcity of empirical research documenting comparative resource use of cohabitant lionfish and native fishes, as well the physiological consequences that may result from interspecific interactions with the invasive species. For this thesis, I conducted two studies designed to elucidate the strength of resource use overlap and potential competition among invasive lionfish and an ecologically similar serranid, the <b>Graysby</b> (Cephalopholis cruentata), along a contiguous coral-reef ledge in Biscayne National Park, South Florida. My first study aimed to determine whether lionfish and <b>Graysby</b> could be classified as competitors through comparisons of <b>Graysby</b> population size, diet, and condition across a range of ambient lionfish biomass. Using stable isotope and gut content analyses, I measured a difference in <b>Graysby</b> diet on sites with larger populations of lionfish, specifically a smaller breadth of resource use and lower consumption of teleost fish prey. Despite a shift in diet, <b>Graysby</b> condition did not vary with lionfish biomass, and thus this study did not provide unequivocal evidence of competition between the two species. However, based on a high amount of apparent overlap in interspecific resource use, competitive interactions between lionfish and species such as <b>Graysby</b> remain likely in systems with more limiting prey or shelter. For my second study, I measured stable isotope values of muscle, liver, and eye lens layers in lionfish and <b>Graysby</b> to further compare individual and population-level patterns of diet and habitat use. The use of eye lenses as metabolically stable chronological recorders of stable isotopes has vast potential to provide insight about animal life history, but has not yet been applied to describe trends in resource use among invasive and native species. To aid these analyses I created a rudimentary map of spatial isotopic variation along the reef ledge of Biscayne National Park, which could serve as a frame of reference to study local-scale animal movements. Isotopic differences between liver and muscle samples suggested a broader range of movement in lionfish than <b>Graysby,</b> important for understanding the relative scale of habitat use in these species. In eye lenses, stable isotope values increased logarithmically with lens radius (i. e. fish size), likely reflecting patterns of trophic growth. There was a high amount of variability among the shapes of eye lens isotopic chronologies, particularly those of lionfish, yielding further information about movement and individual resource use specificity in these species. The results of this thesis are the first to compare native predator diet and condition across a range of invasive lionfish biomass, as well as the first to measure size-structured trends in the resource use of individual lionfish. Together, these results enhance our understanding of the potential for competition among lionfish and native mesopredators, an important objective for researchers studying how this highly invasive species interacts with surrounding ecological communities...|$|E
40|$|Predator {{satiation}} and prey-size preference {{were determined}} for locally caught lionfish, schoolmaster, and <b>graysby,</b> all co-occurring predatory fishes in the Florida coral reef ecosystem. Individuals {{were evaluated by}} exposing them to wild-caught killifish over a gradient of four size classes (20 mm to 60 mm, in 10 mm increments). Preference trials extended over a 2 hr time period and were filmed to determine {{the order in which}} each prey item was consumed. Satiation was evaluated by exposing the predators to an equal number of excess prey items for 24 hrs and evaluating consumed prey weight. Lionfish and schoolmaster showed a significant preference for the smallest size class (20 - 30 mm) while the <b>graysby</b> preferred the largest (50 - 60 mm) and smallest equally. <b>Graysby</b> were shown to consume the least amount of food per gram by biomass (0. 034 g/gram predator- 1) while lionfish consumed the most (0. 079 g/gram predator- 1). A significant difference was also found between consumption rates of lionfish and schoolmaster (0. 053 g/gram predator- 1). If consumption is compared by length between species, lionfish (= 0. 051 g/mm predator- 1) and schoolmaster (= 0. 061 g/mm predator- 1) consumption was not significantly different. These results suggest that lionfish success may stem from its ability to target prey sizes not preferred by the <b>graysby</b> while able to outcompete schoolmaster for the same prey size class. However, if the lionfish is compared on an individual level to schoolmaster by individual or length, consumption is similar, suggesting lionfish consumption is not significantly greater on the reef than the native species on an individual basis...|$|E
40|$|Parasites {{can play}} an {{important}} role in biological invasions. While introduced species often lose parasites from their native range, they can also accumulate novel parasites in their new range. The accumulation of parasites by introduced species likely varies spatially, and more parasites may shift to new hosts where parasite diversity is high. Considering that parasitism and disease are generally more prevalent at lower latitudes, the accumulation of parasites by introduced hosts may be greater in tropical regions. The Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) has become widely distributed across the Western Atlantic. In this study, we compared parasitism across thirteen locations in four regions, spanning seventeen degrees of latitude in the lionfish's introduced range to examine potential spatial variation in parasitism. In addition, as an initial step to explore how indirect effects of parasitism might influence interactions between lionfish and ecologically similar native hosts, we also compared parasitism in lionfish and two co-occurring native fish species, the <b>graysby</b> grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata, and the lizardfish, Synodus intermedius, in the southernmost region, Panama. Our results show that accumulation of native parasites on lionfish varies across broad spatial scales, and that colonization by ectoparasites was highest in Panama, relative to the other study sites. Endoparasite richness and abundance, on the other hand, were highest in Belize where lionfish were infected by twice as many endoparasite species as lionfish in other regions. The prevalence of all but two parasite species infecting lionfish was below 25 %, and we did not detect an association between parasite abundance and host condition, suggesting a limited direct effect of parasites on lionfish, even where parasitism was highest. Further, parasite species richness and abundance were significantly higher in both native fishes compared to lionfish, and parasite abundance was negatively associated with the condition index of the native grouper but not that of the lionfish or lizardfish. While two co-occurring native fishes were more heavily parasitized compared to lionfish in Panama any indirect benefits of differential parasitism requires further investigation. Future parasitological surveys of lionfish across the eastern coast of North America and the Lesser Antilles would further resolve geographic patterns of parasitism in invasive lionfish...|$|E
40|$|Parque National del Este is {{the second}} largest {{protected}} area in the Dominican Republic, comprising 110 km 2 of terrestrial habitats located in the southeastern Dominican Republic. Established in 1975, the park delineation {{did not include the}} adjacent marine area, despite its long history of commercial fisheries. Since 1994, several U. S. and Dominican partner organizations have conducted scientific investigations of the marine resources of the area. This paper provides data on the status of snapper and groupers reef assemblages and finfish fisheriescollected during 1995 1997. Methods used in the study included: 1) visual transects (20 m x 5 m) of predatory fishes in coral reef habitats and 2) fishermen interviews to obtain data on fishing methods and catch composition. Predatory fishes, particularly groupers and snappers, are rare and generally small (3 ̆c 30 cm TL). Larger size snappers (Lutjanus griseus, L. analis) and groupers (Mycreroperca bonaci, M. tigris and M. venenosa) were absent in the visualtransect surveys. Only two Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) were found in 142 transects among 7 reef areas. Among groupers, red hind (E. guttatus), coney (E. fulvus) and <b>graysby</b> (E. cr ue nt atu s) dominated the grouper assemblage in visual transect surveys, as well as in fishermen’s catch. Yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) was the most abundant snapper species in reefs and in fishermen’s catch. Fishermen interviews (n = 120) showed that hook-and-line, traps, and spears were the most commonly used methods. The catch composition reflects the artisanal nature of the fishery. A significant alteration of the park’s fish assemblages due to overfishing is apparent. The designation of zones with different degree of protection (including a no-take zone) is recommended. This plan includes specific regulations on the use of fishing gears, and others regarding minimum size, closed season. These measures {{should be included in the}} oncoming Coastal Management Plan, and will allow to: i) evaluate the potential for fisheries recovery ii) protect what little spawning stock biomass remains in the area, and iii) protect nursery grounds important for juvenile stages. There are few data on the potential contribution of up-current areas (Eastern Caribbean) to reef fish recruitment in the park. A research program addressed to this subject is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|Groupers (Pisces: Serranidae) are {{important}} top-level predators in wider Caribbean, but have experienced significant exploitation, resulting in declines in abundance, size, spawning aggregations, {{and changes in}} species composition. Larger groupers are particularly vulnerable to intense fishing because of their longevity, slow growth, delayed reproduction, and aggregate spawning. Marine fishery reserves (MFR), areas permanently closed to consumptive use, offer a viable means to protect grouper resources. This study reports on fishery-independent surveys of groupers in four regions of the tropical western Atlantic during 1995 - 1997 : Florida Keys, central Bahamas, southeastern Cuba, and Dominican Republic. The regions surveyed included two national parks and a national marine sanctuay, and were further categorized as: 1) intensively fished {{with little or no}} management for groupers (Cuba, Dominican Republic); 2) intensively fished with gear and effort limitations (Florida Keys); 3) lightly fished with some management (N. and S. Exuma Cays, Bahamas); and 4) a. MFR closed to fishing since 1986 (Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, Bahamas). From 10 - 20 strip transects (20 m x 5 m) were surveyed in shallow-water (l- 20 m depth) hard-bottom habitats for grouper species composition, density, and size distribution. Nine grouper species (6 Epinephelus spp., 3 Mycteroperca spp.) were documented among all regions. Areas in which groupers were partially or wholly protected from fishing had greater grouper diversity, density, and biomass, particularly for targeted species such as Nassau grouper (E. striatus). Classification of groupers by three size classes (small, intermediate, large) indicated a distinct gradient from areas with intense fishing to the MFR. In three of the regions affected by intense fishing, one of which has several grouper fishery regulations, grouper abundance and biomass were dominated by non-targeted species such as the <b>graysby</b> (E. cruentatus) and coney (E. fulvus). This second-order effect of fishing probably indicates competitive or predation. MFRs represent a viable means to protect grouper resources, alleviating the complications of enforcement and partially the need to gather fisheries dependent data. The ability of groupers to recover in certain regions may be deterred because of reduced larval recruitment from upstream, heavily fished sources...|$|E

40|$|Epinephelus (Cephalopholis) cruentatus (Lacépède, 1802) [Petrometopon cruentatum], the <b>Graysby,</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{groupers}} on the coral reef at the southwest coast of Curaçao. They are very abundant at a depth from 7 ½ to 9 m. A second, lower maximum in their vertical distribution is found at a depth of 30 m. Juveniles are found mainly at a depth of about 6 m in crevices of the coral species Montastrea annularis. The calculated number of fish actually present appeared to be 24 specimens in a transect of 240 m 2 at a depth of 9 m. Measurements were made of the percentage of bottom cover and of the quantity of coral structure. A strong correlation was found between both. For the studied coral reef in Curaçao a high percentage of bottom cover means at the same time a high quantity of structure and thus of hiding places for the Graysbys. A strong correlation (p < 0. 01) could be observed between the mean number of E. cruentatus and the mean percentage of bottom cover of the coral species M. annularis and Agaricia spp. These coral species have an important influence upon the vertical distribution of E. cruentatus by their growth form, which supplies hiding possibilities e. g. holes, overhangs, crevices. There is a suggestion of a movement in the population to shallower waters during the spawning season. In Curaçao the Graysbys appear to be diurnal. During the night they move deeper into caves and crevices of the reef. The most important food fish of the <b>Graysby,</b> Chromis multilineata, shows the same vertical distribution as its predator and seems also to be strongly determined by the percentage of cover of M. annularis and Agaricia. Otolith readings of E. cruentatus demonstrate that each year 3 growth rings are formed, the formation of which starts in September, January and June. Juveniles, however, form 7 growth rings a year. The translucent zones in the adults are formed in September, January and June, when food intake, condition factor and body growth is low. In the periods following these three months, the opaque zones are formed and this formation coincides with maxima in food intake, condition factor and body growth. Possibly a change in temperature is a factor in initiating a new growth ring. Growth in length and weight of the Graysbys occurs especially in February and to a lesser extent during July and October. The growth equation of Von Bertalanffy for E. cruentatus in Curaçao is: Lt = 41. 5 (1 — e- 0. 13 (t + 0. 94)). The total length-standard length relationship is expressed by the equation: y = 1. 2091 x + 0. 2326 and appears to be linear. The length-weight relationship found for the Graysbys is: W = 0. 0121 x TL 3. 0821, and is closely proportional to the cube of the length. The spawning season occurs from May to October. Mating takes place especially in August and September. Mature females are found mainly between 16 and 25 cm TL, at an age of 4 and 5 years, mature males between 21. 5 and 27. 4 cm TL in age group 6 and to a lesser extent in age groups 5 and 7, transitionals between 19. 5 and 23. 4 cm in age groups 4 and 5. For the transitionals in the length-range of 19. 5 - 23. 4 cm a transition rate of 10 % was found. This relatively high rate is linked with a high increase of numbers of males in this length-range. Transition occurs usually in September, and to a lesser extent during July, August and October, immediately after spawning. A sex-ratio of 2. 5 : 1 was observed for mature females and males. A significant correlation (p < 0. 01) exists between transition rate and sex-ratio. In general a strong dominance of females coincides with a relatively low transition rate and vice versa. Females spawn only once a season, whereas males spawn more frequently and can mate with more than one female. E. cruentatus feeds mainly on fish (75 %) and to a lesser extent on crustaceans (18 %). Juveniles, however, feed more on shrimps (80 %) than on fish. The equation found for the relation mean weight of stomach contents and size classes is: w = 0. 00567 x TL 3. 5917, this indicates that the weight of the stomach contents is a function of about the third power of the length. Graysbys show preference for Chromis multilineata (± 55 %). They feed especially at sunrise and sunset. Food intake varies considerably during the year and is in general high between February and August and lower in the rest of the year. In addition, minima in food intake can be observed in January, September, and possibly in June, and maxima in October-November, February-March and July. These minima and maxima in food intake correspond with time of ring formation in the otoliths. A significant correlation was found between food intake and condition factor during the year (p < 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 21, 2013 - June 21, 2015 Because many coral-reef fishes are observable in situ, are amenable to transplantation, have small home ranges and short generation times, they provide a excellent system to investigate many topics within general ecology, fisheries biology, and conservation biology. The primary goal of this dissertation was to use the coral-reef fishes system to investigate two pressing sets of issues that face marine ecologists and managers of living marine resources. The first topic is the spatial and temporal patterns of larval dispersal and reproductive success in a marine metapopulation (Chapter 2). Because miniscule larvae are difficult to track in the vast pelagic environment, {{little is known about}} the patterns of larval dispersal. Yet, the more that is understood about the spatial and temporal variability in larval dispersal, the easier it will be to identify sites that are self-sustaining and exporting larvae to unprotect sites, a common goal of marine reserves. Incorporating this information into siting of marine reserves will improve their effectiveness. The second topic is fundamental in the ecology of biological invasions: species specific interactions between an invasive predator and native species. Specifically, I investigated the ability of an invasive predator to disrupt natural population regulation of a native prey species (Chapter 3), and the ability of a native predator to provide biotic resistance against the invasive species (Chapter 4). Because management of the lionfish invasion is needed throughout the Caribbean and Atlantic waters, it is necessary to understand not only how lionfish can change the native system, but also potential ways to moderate the negative effects. To address the first topic, we collected a total of 3, 278 genetic tissue samples from bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) over a four year period from reefs near four islands that encompass Exuma Sound, Bahamas (Chapter 2). Using a Bayesian parentage analysis, eight parent-offspring pairs were detected, which directly documented both connectivity between and self-recruitment on an ecological time scale. Remarkably, some larvae returned to the exact same reef where they were spawned, while others traveled to sites greater than 100 km distance. The only study island without a detected parent-offspring pair, Lee Stocking Island, was also the island that showed the most restrictive gene flow on evolutionary time scales. Additionally, variability was documented in the spatial and temporal signatures of sweepstakes reproduction and Wahlund effects. The variation we observed may be influenced by seasonal mesoscale gyres present in Exuma Sound, which play a prominent role in shaping local oceanographic patterns. Understanding how to identify pathways of larval dispersal is important to designing networks of marine reserves, because a common goal of reserves is to protect populations that are self-seeding and can export larvae. Thus, this research not only demonstrates that temporal variability is a prominent characteristic of larval dispersal, but provides an example of how to identify these populations. To address the second topic, two studies using both lab observations and manipulative field experiments were conducted to study the interaction between invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) and two different native species. In the first study (Chapter 3) three different data sets were used to document the effect of lionfish predation on their top prey species, the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum). The first data set was extracted from three previous studies to compare the change in abundance of bridled goby between patch reefs with lionfish and patch reefs that were predator-free. The second data set came from laboratory feeding trials to test for the presence of a size refuge for bridled goby caused by lionfish gape limitation. The third data set came from a manipulative field experiment using 22 nearshore reefs where the per capita mortality of bridled gobies was compared among four orthogonal predator treatments: (1) predator-free control, (2) a single native predator only [...] the <b>graysby</b> grouper (Cephalopholis cruentatus) [...] representing the pre-invasion system, (3) a single lionfish only, and (4) one native grouper and one lionfish, representing the invaded system. The combined results from these three data sets demonstrated that lionfish can consistently consume a significant amount and an extremely high proportion of bridled goby on small patch reefs. While small lionfish cannot eat bridled goby larger than 0. 42 times their body size, large lionfish eat virtually the entire size range of bridled goby. These findings indicate that lionfish have the potential to extirpate local goby populations. In the second experiment, lionfish were exposed to different abundances of a native grouper, the Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), on 28 nearshore patch reefs in the Bahamas. Lionfish persistence and growth was monitored over 10 weeks, as well as the abundance of small, < 5 cm total length (TL), native reef fishes. Nassau grouper did not affect lionfish persistence or growth. Yet, reefs with a lionfish and many Nassau grouper saw a significant increase in the abundance of small reef fishes compared to reefs with only lionfish or lionfish with few grouper. Thus, it appears that high densities of Nassau grouper provide some biotic resistance on Bahamian patch reefs by potentially interfering with lionfish predation on native fishes, perhaps by interrupting stalking behavior. This dissertation highlights the flexibility of the coral-reef fishes system for investigation of broadly different topics in basic and applied ecology. Coral-reef fishes are a tractable system for both large and small scale studies, as well as laboratory observations and manipulative field experiments. The findings of this dissertation advance the understanding of metapopulation dynamics and have implications for fisheries management and marine reserve design. This research also documents further evidence of the negative effects of lionfish, yet provides some promising findings that may indicate some native biotic resistance to this devastating of marine invasions...|$|E
