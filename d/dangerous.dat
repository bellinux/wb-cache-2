5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several <b>dangerous</b> bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom {{but it is not}} as <b>dangerous</b> as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most <b>dangerous</b> roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E

5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape <b>dangerous</b> {{position}}s. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and <b>dangerous</b> areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from <b>dangerous</b> areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E

5|$|In late 1992, the <b>Dangerous</b> Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire <b>Dangerous</b> Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that <b>Dangerous</b> Journeys was based on D and AD. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to <b>Dangerous</b> Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on <b>Dangerous</b> Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E

The Los Baños variant has a slightly wider repertoire of tactics.|$|E
