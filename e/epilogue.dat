In the extended <b>epilogue</b> shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended <b>epilogue</b> ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the <b>epilogue</b> instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E
