Key words: Glaucidium brasilianum, <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Pygmy-Owl,</b> diet, {{breeding}} biology, Chaco. Owls of {{the genus}} Glaucidium (pygmy-owls and owlets) are small, crepuscular and diurnal, cavity-nesters. Although 10 pygmy-owl spe-cies occur in South America (König & Weick 2005), only one species, the Austral Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium nanum) had a detailed dietary study (Jiménez & Jaksic 1989), and only anec-dotal reports exist for the diet {{of some of the}} other species (Poulin et al. 1994, Robbins & Stiles 1999). The <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Pygmy-Owl</b> (Glaucidium brasilianum) is geographically wide-spread, with 3 of 12 subspecies occurring i...|$|E
40|$|Many birds join {{cooperative}} mobbing aggregations {{and collectively}} harass predators. Individuals participating in these ephemeral associations benefit by deterring the predator, but also incur energetic costs and {{increased risk of}} predation. Explaining the evolution of mobbing is challenging because individuals could prevail by selfishly seeking safety while allowing others to mob. An important step in understanding the evolution of mobbing is to identify factors affecting its expression. The ecological constraints model suggests that animals {{are more likely to}} cooperate under adverse environmental conditions, such as when local predation pressure is high. We tested this prediction by comparing the mobbing responses of several species of birds to the local abundance of their primary predator, the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>pygmy-owl</b> Glaucidium brasilianum. We used acoustic playback to elicit mobbing responses in environments where owls were common, uncommon, or rare. Stimuli were either the song of a <b>ferruginous</b> <b>pygmy-owl</b> or the mobbing calls of three of the owl’s common prey species. During each playback, we characterized mobbing responses by noting the number of species and individuals that approached the loudspeaker, as well as the closest approach by any bird. Mobbing responses to both stimuli were strong in locations where Ferruginous Pygmy-owls were common, intermediate where owls were uncommon, and weak where they were rare. This pattern persisted even after controlling for differences in species richness and composition among the three environments. Results support the ecological constraints model and provide strong evidence that intense predation pressure increases the expression of cooperative mobbing in tropical birds [Current Zoology 58 (5) : 781 - 790, 2012]...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in resources {{is a fundamental}} driver of habitat quality but the realized value of resources {{at any point in}} space may depend on the effects of conspecifics and stochastic factors, such as weather, which vary through time. We evaluated the relative and combined effects of habitat resources, weather, and conspecifics on habitat quality for <b>ferruginous</b> <b>pygmy-owls</b> (Glaucidium brasilianum) in the Sonoran Desert of northwest Mexico by moni-toring reproductive output and conspecific abundance over 10 years in and around 107 terri-tory patches. Variation in reproductive output was much greater across space than time, and although habitat resources explained a much greater proportion of that variation (0. 70) than weather (0. 17) or conspecifics (0. 13), evidence for interactions among each of these components of the environment was strong. Relative to habitat that was persistently low in quality, high-quality habitat buffered the negative effects of conspecifics and amplified the benefits of favorable weather, but did not buffer the disadvantages of harsh weather. More-over, the positive effects of favorable weather at low conspecific densities were offset by in-traspecific competition at high densities. Although realized habitat quality declined wit...|$|R
40|$|Sequences of the {{cytochrome}} b {{gene and}} genotypes from 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci {{were used to}} assess phylogeographic variation in <b>ferruginous</b> <b>pygmy-owls</b> (Glaucidium brasilianum) from Arizona, Mexico, and Texas. Analysis of mtDNA indicated that pygmy-owl populations in Arizona and Texas are unique, with no shared haplotypes. Populations from Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico, were distinct from remaining populations in Mexico and grouped closest to haplotypes in Arizona. Nested clade analysis of mtDNA sequence data indicated past fragmentation separated pygmy-owls into two major groups: 1) Arizona, Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico, and 2) southwestern (Nayarit and Michoacan), south-central (Oaxaca and Chiapas), and eastern Mexico, along the eastern slope of the Sierra Madre Oriental from Texas to Central America. In addition, analysis of mtDNA variation in several species of Glaucidium support the recommendation that populations of G. brasilianum from Mexico, Texas, and Arizona represent a phylogenetically distinct group from populations occurring in South America. The level of separation between the North and South Americanpopulations justifies granting species status (G. ridgwayi) to the North American population. Analysis of distance matrices derived from genotypes of 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci supports restricted gene flow between pygmy-owl populations in Arizona-Sonora and Sinaloa, and Texas-Tamaulipas and the remainder of states in Mexico. The Arizona-Sonora population showed signs of a recent genetic bottleneck, an observation supported by low population estimates for Arizona (13 - 117 individuals). Heterozygosity in Arizona, however, was equal to levels recorded throughout Mexico and Texas. Congruent patterns revealed by both mtDNA and nuclear DNA (microsatellites) indicate Arizona and Texas populations are distinct subspecies that require the design and implementation of separate management plans for recovery and conservation efforts...|$|R

We evaluated the relative and combined effects of habitat resources, weather, and conspecifics on habitat quality for <b>ferruginous</b> <b>pygmy-owls</b> (Glaucidium brasilianum) in the Sonoran Desert of northwest Mexico by monitoring reproductive output and conspecific abundance over 10 years in and around 107 territory patches. Variation in reproductive output was much greater across space than time, and although habitat resources explained a much greater proportion of that variation (0. 70) than weather (0. 17) or conspecifics (0. 13), evidence for interactions among each of these components of the environment was strong. Relative to habitat that was persistently low in quality, high-quality habitat buffered the negative effects of conspecifics and amplified the benefits of favorable weather, but did not buffer the disadvantages of harsh weather. Moreover, the positive effects of favorable weather at low conspecific densities were offset by intraspecific competition at high densities. Although realized habitat quality declined with increasing conspecific density suggesting interference mechanisms associated with an Ideal Free Distribution, broad spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality persisted. Factors linked to food resources had positive effects on reproductive output but only where nest cavities were sufficiently abundant to mitigate the negative effects of heterospecific enemies. Annual precipitation and brooding-season temperature had strong multiplicative effects on reproductive output, which declined at increasing rates as drought and temperature increased, reflecting conditions predicted to become more frequent with climate change. Because the collective environment influences habitat quality in complex ways, integrated approaches that consider habitat resources, stochastic factors, and conspecifics are necessary to accurately assess habitat quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the structural components of vegetation have impact over the distribution of owl species in a fragment of a semi-deciduous seasonal forest. This paper also determined which vegetation variables contributed to the spatial distribution of owl species. It was developed in the Perobas Biological Reserve (PBR) between September and December 2011. To conduct the owl census, a playback technique was applied at hearing points distributed to cover different vegetation types in the study area. A total of 56 individual owls of six species were recorded: Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba), Black-capped Screech-Owl (Megascops atricapilla), Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana), <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Pygmy-Owl</b> (Glaucidium brasilianum), Mottled Owl (Strix virgata) and Stygian Owl (Asio stygius). The results suggest that the variables of vegetation structure have impact on the occurrence of owls. The canopy height, the presence of hollow trees, fallen trees and glades are the most important structural components influencing owl distribution in the sampled area...|$|E
