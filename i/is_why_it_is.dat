After so much hype around {{the filming of}} the video it was very disappointing to see Rihanna so blatantly smoking throughout it... Artists such as Rihanna are held in high esteem and regarded as role models by millions of young people.|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply {{as a matter of}} coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man seeks Gibson Praise, who is {{undergoing}} brain surgery {{at that very}} moment. Mulder and Scully head to the home where the alien gestated, finding an alien's nail in the wall. The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the nuclear power plant. Inside they find organic material {{on the ground and}} cooling pipes.|$|E

5|$|The grey-necked wood rail or grey-cowled wood rail (Aramides cajaneus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae, the rails. It lives {{primarily}} in the forests, mangroves, and swamps of Central and South America. Of the two subspecies, A. c. avicenniae is found in southeastern Brazil, while the nominate is found throughout {{the portion of the}} range not occupied by the other subspecies. The species as a whole is usually found at elevations from sea level to , although some have been found above that. This bird's large extent of occurrence along with its population <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> considered to be least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In some places, it is occasionally hunted and kept for food.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|Yomtov Lipman Heller wrote a {{commentary}} called Tosafot Yom Tov. In the introduction Heller {{says that his}} aim is to make additions (tosafoth) to Bertinoro’s commentary. The glosses are sometimes quite detailed and analytic. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sometimes compared to the Tosafot – discussions of Babylonian gemara by French and German scholars of the 12th–13th centuries. In many compact Mishnah printings, a condensed version of his commentary, titled Ikar Tosafot Yom Tov, is featured.|$|E

25|$|Rubella has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|The stalk (or rafle) is the {{herbaceous}} branch {{that bears}} the grapes. It consists of about 80% water, soluble minerals (nearly 3% {{with half of}} potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste and the sensation of astringency. In the production of a white wine, the stalk does not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins is not desirable in the wine. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quickly isolated {{from the rest of the}} harvest, either by shaking or by pressing.|$|E
25|$|For toy safety, {{every country}} {{has its own}} regulations. But since the {{globalization}} and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of. Countries or trade zones such as the European Union regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products.|$|E

25|$|Jews {{observe a}} Day of Atonement Yom Kippur {{on the day}} before God makes {{decisions}} regarding what will happen during the coming year. Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{agreement}} {{of a system}} design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will {{do the right thing}} in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.|$|E
25|$|In some algorithms, an {{intermediate}} result is computed {{in a larger}} precision, then must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, {{the idea is to}} round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called sticky rounding. Equivalently, it consists in returning the intermediate result when it is exactly representable, and the nearest floating-point number with an odd significand otherwise; this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also known as rounding to odd.|$|E
