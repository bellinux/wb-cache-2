This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E

5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E

5|$|The rise of {{molecular}} techniques {{at the end}} of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results {{of molecular}} studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} re-excavated in July 2013 {{to learn more}} about the friary church, before {{building}} work on the adjacent disused school building. In a project co-funded by Leicester City Council and the University of Leicester, a single trench about twice the area of the 2012 trenches was excavated. It succeeded in exposing the entirety of the sites of the Greyfriars presbytery and choir sites, confirming archaeologists' earlier <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> the layout of the church's east end. Three burials identified but not excavated in the 2012 project were tackled afresh. One burial was found to have been interred in a wooden coffin in a well-dug grave, while a second wooden-coffined burial was found under and astride the choir and presbytery; its position suggests that it pre-dates the church.|$|E
5|$|There are two <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> {{the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic {{hypothesis}} suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from {{the nucleus of the}} eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E

5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and <b>hypotheses</b> <b>about</b> that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E
