In the frequency domain, the <b>generalised</b> <b>damping</b> matrix and the generalised stiffness matrix of the stochastic computational reduced-order model are random frequency-dependent matrices. Due to the causality of the dynamical system, these two frequency-dependent random matrices are statistically dependent and their probabilistic model involves a Hilbert transform. In this paper, a computational analysis of the propagation of uncertainties is presented for a composite viscoelastic structure in the frequency range...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} easy-to-implement {{algorithm}} {{to identify a}} <b>generalised</b> proportional viscous <b>damping</b> matrix is developed in this work. The chief advantage of the pro-posed technique is that only a single drive-point frequency response function (FRF) measurement is needed. Such FRFs are routinely measured using the standard techniques of experimental modal analysis, such as impulse test. The practical utility of the proposed identification scheme is illustrated on three representative structures: (1) a free-free beam in Â°exural vibration, (2) a quasi-periodic three-cantilever structure made by inserting slots in a plate, in out-of-plane flexural vibration, and (3) a point-coupled-beam system. The finite element method is used to obtain the mass and stiffness matrices for each system and damping matrix is fitted to measured variation of the damping (modal damping factors) with the natural frequency of vibration. The fitted viscous damping matrix does accommodate for any smooth variation of damping with frequency, {{as opposed to the}} conventional proportional damping matrix. It is concluded that a more <b>generalised</b> viscous <b>damping</b> matrix, allowing for smooth variation of damping as a function of frequency, can be accommodated within the framework of standard finite element modelling and vibration analysis of linear systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} assess the effect of bull bars on the head {{kinematics}} and head impact severity of an adult pedestrian in a collision. Multibody models were created to represent a range of sport-utility vehicles and common bull bar geometries and materials. The contact-impact behaviours of the pedestrian-vehicle interactions were determined {{from a series of}} impact tests with the vehicles and the bull bars being modelled. A <b>generalised</b> Hunt-Crossley <b>damping</b> model was fitted to the test data. The interaction models were implemented in MADYMO models of a vehicle pedestrian collision using the geometry of the vehicles and bull bars and a fiftieth percentile male human model. Head kinematics were extracted and the head impact severity estimated. The speed of the head impact with the bonnet was increased by between 7 and 55 percent in simulations where a bull bar was fitted to the vehicle. The increase in head impact velocity was not related to the bull bar material type. The 55 percent increase in head impact speed produced a 249 percent increase in HIC value, using a head-bonnet interaction model based on Australasian NCAP head impact test results. The location of the head impact was affected by the bull bar but the effect was not consistent. The simulation results show that the addition of a bull bar to the front of a vehicle increases the speed of the head impact with the bonnet. This speed increase appears to be less a product of the material the bull bar is made from, but more a product of the geometry of the bull bar. This suggests that bull bar geometries could be altered to improve pedestrian collision kinematics possibly even lessening the severity of the head impact with the bonnet. Combined with a soft material, such as polymer, this may lead to a safer bull bar designs for pedestrians. RWG Anderson, S Doecke, AL van den Berg, DJ Searson, G Pont...|$|R
