40|$|Adult and {{immature}} {{male and}} female, one newborn pup and a fetus of Dalli-type Ball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoenoides dalli) collected from northwestern North Pacific were analyzed for the PCB and DDE levels in their blubber. A wide difference {{existed in the}} levels of these chemicals between males and females. Concentrations of both the chemicals increased consistently with age in the bodies of males. On the other hand, there was a decrease with age in the levels of these compounds in females after about two years of age, possibly due to a lactational and parturitional transfer of these compounds. When comparing the concentrations of these compounds in the adult males and females of various marine mammals, the females had always less than 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{organochlorine}} residues (PCB and p, p′-DDE) {{in the adult}} male Dalli and Truei porpoises collected from North Pacific, Bering Sea and Japan Sea are reported. Different levels of these compounds were observed in the individuals with respect to sex and location, indicating the fact that man-made organics {{can be used as}} chemical indicators in tracing out certain ecological and physiological events in long-life marine animals. Considerably lower levels of these chemicals were detected in the blubber samples of adult females when compared with the adult males from the same area, indicating parturition and lactation as the possible major routes of excretion in females. On the basis of different ranges and means of PCB and DDE concentrations, certain suggestions are also made about the different feeding grounds and the geographical ranges of Dall 2 ̆ 7 s and True 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>porpoises</b> in the present study area...|$|R
40|$|New host {{records for}} Campula oblonga Cobbold, 1858 {{from the common}} dolphin, Delphinus delphis L., and from the {{thresher}} shark, Alopias vulpinus (Bonnaterre), are reported herein. Campulids have not been reported previously from a host {{that was not a}} marine mammal. The excellent condition and small size of the gravid specimen and the diet and natural history of the thresher shark lead us to conclude that the digene was acquired from the consumption of infected fish. Specimens of C. oblonga from these two hosts and from harbor porpoises, Phocoena phocoena (L.), and from Dall 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>porpoises,</b> Phocoenoides dalli (True), are compared, and a wide variation in ranges and values for characters is noted. The synonymy of Campula folium Ozaki, 1935 with C. oblonga is further supported by the apparent effect of the host {{on the size of the}} trematodes. Due to the degree of variation in measurements and the numerous factors that may impact these values, we recommend the use of qualitative morphologic characters for the identification of C. oblonga...|$|R

40|$|The re-introduction of California condors into Oregon is {{currently}} being considered, but there are concerns {{about the safety of}} the potential food sources of this species. Condors are opportunistic feeders and a largely available food source for this species will be the carcasses of stranded marine mammals. Organochlorine contaminants are of particular concern due to the life history and trophic status of most marine species found stranded on local beaches in Oregon and Washington. The objectives {{of this study was to}} monitor blubber samples from stranded marine mammals off of the Oregon and Washington coasts for 18 chlorinated pesticides, and 16 PCB congeners (PCB Group 1 a, 1 b, and 2), measured using GC-ECD, to determine if consumption of the carcasses pose a potential risk for re-introduced condors. In addition, this study will evaluate if any relationship exists between pesticide levels in mammal blubber samples and some of the post-mortem parameters recorded for each specimen (length, blubber thickness, the presence of disease, and sex). We analyzed multiple blubber samples from 7 different marine mammal species (California sea lions n = 6, harbor seals n = 3, Steller sea lions n = 6, harbor porpoises n = 3), collected from the Oregon and Southern Washington coasts. We also looked at single blubber samples from a sperm whale, elephant seal, and Dall 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>porpoise.</b> DDE was the most prevalent organochlorine contaminant making up more than 77...|$|R

40|$|During the 1980 s, {{extensive}} bycatch of seabirds {{and marine}} mammals in central California’s set gillnet fisheries prompted {{a series of}} area and depth closures, which ultimately appeared successful at reducing mortality of the species of primary concern, Common Murre (Uria aalge), sea otter (Enhydra lutris), and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The effects of the restrictions, however, were confounded with changes in the distribu-tion and intensity of fishing effort during the early 1990 s. This study documents 1990 - 1998 patterns of fishing effort in the central California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) gillnet fishery and presents information on bycatch of the above three species. A National Marine Fisheries Service observer program obtained bycatch data from 1990 to 1994, but was dis-continued after 1994. Since then, gillnet effort has increased and shifted into the southern areas of Monterey Bay, where bycatch was high during the 1980 s. The recent increase in gillnet effort coincides with higher beach deposition rates for all three species. In this study, historical entanglement rate data are combined with estimates of fishing effort for 1995 - 1998 to produce several sets of mortality estimates based {{on a variety of}} assump- 142 Forney et al. — Bycatch in Central California Gillnets tions. Without further data, {{it is not possible to}} validate most of the as-sumptions. The range of total mortality estimates for the 4 -year period 1995 - 1998 is 5, 918 - 13, 060 Common Murres (S. E. 477 - 1, 252), 144 - 662 har-bor <b>porpoises</b> (<b>S.</b> E. 18 - 53), and 17 - 125 sea otters (S. E. 4 - 25), raising con-cern for all three species. The recent changes in fishing effort and distribution underscore the importance of monitoring variability in both fishing practices and the distribution of vulnerable species when evaluat-ing long-term fishery impacts...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-eight harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, (33 females, 45 males) were {{obtained}} from the summer (June-September) cod fishery incidental-by-catch in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and examined for the presence of cranial sinus nematodes. This is the first quantitative and in-depth study of the distribution of Stenurus minor (Kuhn, 1829) Baylis and Daubney, 1925 in the cranium of by-caught harbour porpoises. Stenurus minor was present in the cranial sinuses of all adult porpoises ($>$ 1 yr, n = 66, x = 2362, range 87 - 8920) and absent in all young-of-the-year ($<$ 1 yr, n = 12). Only fifth-stage worms were observed and these were equally distributed between the right and left side ot the skull (mean intensity = 1158 and 1213 in the left and right side, respectively). Female S. minor were predominant (1 : 1. 8 sex ratio). Mean intensity of S. minor was similar among all infected porpoises, suggesting an annual loss and recruitment of this parasite. Parasite load had no apparent effect on porpoise body condition (measured as % blubber weight of carcass). No gross lesions associated with the presence of numerous S. minor in the cranial sinuses, were observed. There was an inverse relationship between the intensity of S. minor and mean worm-length, suggestive of a "crowding effect". Mean worm-length in lightly infected porpoises was 17. 8 $ pm$ 0. 2 mm and 16. 1 $ pm$ 0. 2 mm in heavily infected animals. Possible life-cycles and modes of transmission are examined in light of our findings. The absence of <b>S.</b> minor in <b>porpoises</b> less than 1 year old suggests heteroxenous transmission of this parasite, via an intermediate host in the food chain. Transmammary and or transplacental transmission is unlikely...|$|R
