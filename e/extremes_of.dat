5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E

5|$|Stretford {{comprises}} the local areas of Old Trafford, Gorse Hill, Trafford Park and Firswood. Its climate is generally temperate, with few <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> temperature or weather.

5|$|Between the <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> {{bicycles}} with classical {{front-wheel steering}} {{and those with}} strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with a naturally high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but the shelter can be open and simple. They tend to thrive in <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> heat and cold and have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} suboptimal soil conditions.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Some sites along Shackleton's rim receive almost {{constant}} illumination. At these locales sunlight {{is almost}} always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels, potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings. The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> 100°C when the Sun is overhead, to as low as −150°C during the lunar night.|$|E

5|$|The diamond {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, as well as around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There is a record of this ray from off British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Tolerant of both {{heat and}} cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture {{hardiness}} zones three through nine, although some cultivars {{may be better}} suited than others to <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east {{across much of the}} country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E

The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel.|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> its distribution are migratory.|$|E
