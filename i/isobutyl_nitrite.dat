40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., nonstick cooking spray and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrites,</b> often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants.

50|$|The sale of alkyl nitrite-based poppers {{was banned}} in Canada in 2013. Although not {{considered}} a narcotic and not illegal to possess or use, they are considered a drug. Sales that are not authorized can now be punished with fines and prison. Since 2007, reformulated poppers containing isopropyl nitrite are sold in Europe because only <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> is prohibited. In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrite, pentyl nitrite, or isomers thereof, has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers. In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs. After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the Council of State {{on the grounds that}} the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Abuse of nitrite inhalants {{is common}} among male homosexuals {{and a history}} of abuse has been cor-related with {{seropositivity}} to HIV and with the incidence of Kaposi’s sarcoma among AIDS patients. The present study shows that inhalation exposure of mice to 900 ppm <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> for 45 mm/day for 14 days compromised macrophage tumoricidal activity by up to 40 % and it re-mained compromised for at least 7 days after terminating exposures. The inhalation exposures did not affect tumor cell binding but did inhibit inducible nitric oxide (N 0). The N 0 synthase inhibitor. M-methyl-L-arginine to-tally inhibited both N 0 production and cytotoxicity, suggesting that reductions in N 0 due to inhalant ex-posure may be responsible for the reduced cytotoxic ac-tivity. Exposure to the inhalant increased constitutive production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). TNF-a has been reported to stimulate the replication of HIV and the proliferation of Kaposi’s sarcoma cells in vitro. J. Leu-koc. Biol. 57 : 135 - 140; 1995...|$|E

40|$|The {{abuse of}} alkyl nitrites is {{becoming}} a serious social problem worldwide. In this report, a simple and sensitive method is presented for the determination of n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, and isoamyl alcohol as decomposition products of alkyl nitrites in human whole blood and urine samples using capillary gas chromatography (GC) with cryogenic oven trapping. After heating a whole blood or urine sample containing each alkyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol [the internal standard (IS) ] in a 7 -mL vial at 55 °C for 15 min, 5 mL of the headspace vapor is drawn into a gas-tight syringe and injected into a GC inlet port. The vapor is introduced into an Rtx-BAC 2 medium-bore capillary column in the splitless mode at 0 °C oven temperature in order to trap the entire analytes, and then the oven temperature is programmed up to 240 °C for the GC measurements by flame ionization detection. These conditions give sharp peaks for each compound and the IS and low background noise for whole blood or urine samples. The detection limits of the analytes are 10 ng/mL for whole blood and 5 ng/mL for urine. Linearity and precision are also tested to confirm the reliability of this method. Isobutyl alcohol and methemoglobin could be determined from the whole blood samples of three male volunteers who had sniffed <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} pharmacokinetic/hemodynamic properties of inhaled <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> (ISBN) in rats. ISBN is one of the volatile organic nitrites that has been used primarily as a drug of abuse. Recent studies indicate, however, that these compounds may be superior to organic nitrates for cardiovascular use because they do not produce vascular tolerance. Rats inhaled ISBN over an exposure range of 20 to 1200 ppm for 1 hour. The effects of ISBN on blood pressure and heart rate were determined and blood concentrations of ISBN were analyzed with use of gas chromatography. Apparent steady-state blood levels of ISBN were achieved during inhalation and were linear with exposure concentration (blood concentration: 0. 05 to 3. 5 μM: exposure concentration: 23 to 1177 ppm; r 2 = 0. 92). Inhaled ISBN caused rapid, dose-dependent, and parallel reductions in systolic and diastolie pressure, while heart rate increased maximally to 22 %. A sigmoid Emax model could describe the mean arterial pressure effect of inhaled ISBN (Emax= 55 %; EC 50 = 0. 51 μM). After inhalation, blood pressure and heart rate quickly returned to baseline, without any withdrawal rebound effect. Inhaled ISBN produced a rapid onset of action on heart rate and blood pressure, and these effects were sustained over 60 minutes of exposure. Abrupt drug withdrawal did not lead to hemodynamic rebound. The blood pressure effects were related to ISBN blood concentration by the sigmoid Emax model. These results provide new information on the pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationship of a representative nitrite inhalant...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of acute <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> (ISBN) exposure on the activity of several hepatic enzymes. Two strains of adult male mice (Balb/c and C 57 BL/ 6) were exposed to 900 ppm ISBN or ambient air for 45 minutes. The enzyme activity of hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -mediated deethylation, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and carboxylesterase (CBE) was monitored through the substrates 3 -cyano- 7 -ethoxycoumarin (CEC), 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene, and p-nitrophenyl acetate, respectively. Acute ISBN exposure led to a significant reduction in hepatic CYP-mediated CEC deethylation, GST, and CBE activity in Balb/c mice (of 81. 5 %, 74. 7 %, and 25. 2 %, respectively, vs control mice, each at P<. 05) when livers were harvested immediately after inhalant exposure. The corresponding decreases in C 57 BL/ 6 mice were smaller (with reductions of 21. 8 %, 18. 8 %, and 13. 3 %, respectively, each at P<. 05). This enzyme activity, tested in C 57 BL/ 6 mice only, returned to control values after a 24 -hour period of nonexposure. Follow-up mechanistic investigations using rat liver GST indicated that ISBN-mediated enzyme inactivation was not caused by its metabolites: inorganic nitrite ion (NO 2 −) or nitric oxide. This inactivation could be prevented, but not reversed, by added glutathione, suggesting irreversible protein oxidation. Using different NO donors as comparative agents, we found that GST inactivation by ISBN was not associated with protein S-nitrosylation or disulfide formation, but with tyrosine nitration. Inhalant nitrite exposure, therefore, led to a significant reduction in hepatic enzyme activity in mice, possibly through tyrosine nitration of hepatic proteins. This effect raises the possibility of drug-drug metabolic interactions from inhalant nitrite abuse. However, determining the applicability of these findings to humans will require further study...|$|E
40|$|Poppers maculopathy’Fan {{emerging}} ophthalmic {{reaction to}} recreational substance abuse ‘Poppers ’ (alkyl nitrite class of compounds) are inhaled for recreational purposes and {{may provide a}} brief rush of euphoria and sexual arousal. In the United Kingdom, poppers are legal to purchase but illegal to sell for human consumption. Poppers are widely used in the gay and ‘nightclubbing ’ communities. They are regarded as low health risk. In 2008 (due to legislative changes), {{the most commonly used}} poppers compound changed from <b>isobutyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> to isopropyl nitrite. 1 We report a patient who developed maculopathy following isopropyl nitrite inhalation. Case report A 53 -year-old HIV-negative gay male reported blurred vision in both eyes for 18 months. The patient admitted to regular use (at least daily) of isopropyl nitrite poppers (brand ‘Liquid Gold’) for the previous 18 months. He did not smoke, had low alcohol intake, and denied any other substance abuse. He had no significant past medical, ophthalmic or family history. Best-corrected visual acuity was 6 / 18 OU, 6 / 9 with pinhole. Optometric report stated 6 / 5 OU 2 years earlier. Central visual field testing was normal (Humphrey 10 – 2). Mild central distortion was reported on Amsler grid testing. Colour vision; 16 / 17 Ishihara plates correctly seen each eye, and slight tritan defect on Farnsworth D- 15 test. Bilateral discrete vitelliform foveal lesions were present. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction confined to the area below the foveal pit in both eyes (Figure 1). No other retinal abnormalities were found. Fundus fluorescein angiography was unremarkable. Comment This is the first UK report of ‘poppers maculopathy’. Our case resembles the clinical description in recent reports from France among patients inhaling poppers. 2, 3 Recent changes to poppers compounds in use may be responsible for the recent recognition of this maculopathy despite decades of popular poppers use. It is possible that failure to enquire about recreational substance inhalation in patients with maculopathy may have led to this condition being missed. Ophthalmologists should ask patients with unexplained foveal yellow spots or outer lamellar macular changes on OCT imaging about inhalation of poppers. 4 Surveillance for this matter in the United Kingdom may be of merit...|$|E
