On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow,</b> knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} part of the cemetery was built between 1945 and 1947 by Herta Hammerbacher, and expanded from 1948 to 1954 by Max Dietrich. About a third of the area was forest, which was already 50 years old and was intentionally kept. The trees are mostly firs, with a few oaks, mountain-ashes and birches. Two straight paths in north-south direction structure the cemetery, connected by curved paths. The funeral halls are situated on a natural hill. Between the entrance and the halls is a large U-shaped meadow which was originally designed as heath. The graves are arranged in rows, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> part as in the forest part.|$|E
25|$|For over 600 years Stamford was {{the site}} of the Stamford Bull Run festival, held {{annually}} on 13 November, St Brice's day, until 1839. According to local tradition, the custom was started by William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, after he saw two bulls fighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> beneath his castle viewpoint. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town. The earl mounted his horse and rode after the animal; he enjoyed the sport so much that he gave the meadow in which the fight began to the butchers of Stamford on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after.|$|E

500|$|In May 1795 tenders {{were invited}} {{for the first}} section to be built from the meadows near Goosehard (or Gooseyard) near Paulton to Hopyard in the Parish of Camerton. In June 1795 a contractor, (Houghton & Son from Shropshire), started the {{terminus}} at Paulton meadows using local labour. This first section of the canal was completed on Monday 1 October 1798; the first load of coal along the canal was delivered to Bath via Dunkerton. Some 14 collieries at Timsbury & Paulton were connected to their respective basins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> terminus by tramways. [...] This involved the construction of three tramway bridges over the Cam brook. A further bridge at Upper Radford was required over the canal; at this point tramways connected the Withy Mills and Radford workings. The course of the Cam brook was modified at various places to protect the canal from erosion. In 1799 William Whitmore and his partner, Norton, offered to build a balance (or geometrical) lift without payment, on condition that if successful they were to have £17,300 and a royalty of 4pence per ton of goods passed.|$|E

After he battles and defeats first Karus then Ronno, Bambi and Faline fall in love with each other. They {{spend a great deal of}} time together. During this time, the old Prince saves Bambi's life when he nearly runs towards a hunter imitating a doe's call. This teaches the young buck to be cautious about blindly rushing toward any deer's call. During the summer, Gobo returns to the forest having been raised by a man who found him collapsed in the snow during the hunt where Bambi's mother was killed. While his mother and Marena welcome him and celebrate him as a [...] "friend" [...] of man, the old Prince and Bambi pity him. Marena becomes his mate, but several weeks later Gobo is killed when he approaches a hunter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow,</b> falsely believing the halter he wore would keep him safe from all men.|$|E

500|$|The young Alf Ramsey was {{described}} by his friend Fred Tibble as [...] "a very quiet boy who really loved sport". In his 1952 autobiography Talking Football, Ramsey would describe [...] "liv for the open air from the moment I could toddle", spending hours each day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a tennis ball. From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to 14. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between {{each other on the}} way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played cricket to a high standard and represented the school in the high jump, the long jump, the 100-yard and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed boxing until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent—"as wide as I was tall" [...] in Ramsey's recollection—gave him a severe beating in a school tournament. Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

40|$|Changes in montane meadow {{vegetation}} {{were examined}} in a previously ephemeral drainage that received flow augmentation as a mitigation measure for a transbasin diversion in southeastern Wyoming. After two years of elevated surface and groundwater levels, the herbaceous vegetation shifted toward more water-tolerant species.

2500|$|Hoxsey Therapy, {{a mixture}} of herbs, was first marketed as a purported cure for cancer in the 1920s by Harry Hoxsey, a former coal miner and {{insurance}} salesman, and Norman Baker, a radio personality. Hoxsey himself traced the treatment to his great-grandfather, who observed a horse with a tumor on its leg cure itself by grazing upon wild plants growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow.</b> John Hoxsey gathered these herbs and mixed them with old home remedies used for cancer. Among the claims made in his book, he purports his therapy aims to restore [...] "physiological normalcy" [...] to a disturbed metabolism throughout the body, with emphasis on purgation, to help carry away wastes from the tumors he believed his herbal mixtures caused to necrotize.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, housing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Meadows</b> {{was deemed}} {{unsuitable}} {{by the council}} and {{a large part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Meadows</b> was demolished {{to make way for a}} new development of modern council housing. The new development was based on the Radburn model of planning which consisted of segregating traffic and pedestrians by constructing cul-de-sacs, feeder roads and underpasses. <b>In</b> 1975, <b>the</b> viaduct carrying the Great Central railway and Arkwright Street station was demolished as the new development started to take shape.

2500|$|The park is {{a popular}} spot for bird watching, with up to 264 species having been spotted. Common bird species {{observed}} within the park include great horned owl, northern saw-whet owl, barn owl, red-tailed hawk, and warblers on Hunter Island; American woodcock, willow flycatcher, northern harrier, woodpeckers, black-capped chickadee, tufted titmouse, and white-breasted nuthatch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> west of Orchard Beach; and various songbirds and sparrows north of the Pelham Bay Golf Course. Birds in the park's waters include loons, grebes, cormorants, anseriformes, and gulls from the Twin Island coasts; greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, loons, hooded merganser, Canada goose, mallard, and egrets in Eastchester Bay and Turtle Cove; and osprey and waterbirds in the lagoon.

2500|$|Turtle Cove {{is a small}} cove {{along the}} north side of City Island Road west of Orchard Beach Road. Around the early 1900s, a land berm was created across Turtle Cove for rails for horsecars.

Starting in June 2009, NYC Parks started a restoration project for the cove, removing the old culvert and digging a canal to flood {{the north end of the}} cove with salt water. NYC Parks then placed a foot bridge across the canal. Some [...] of forest were also restored, with 10,000 trees being replaced. The cove also contains a batting cage and a golf center with miniature golf, PGA simulators, and grass tees.|$|E
