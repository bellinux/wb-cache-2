40|$|<b>Debates</b> <b>about</b> {{disability}} within geography, {{as well as}} in disability studies more generally, {{have been}} largely urban, Anglophone and Western-centric. Not only have industrialised societies remained the predominant focus of attention, but the debates themselves are rooted within an often unacknowledged Western context. In the light of this, this article aims to bring together <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> disability and development, which have until relatively recently tended to be mutually exclusive, and provides a critical review of recent <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> disability issues in developing countries. By doing so, it furthers <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> the significance of geography in disability studies, challenges the Western-centric focus of disability models and extends understanding of the shifting and complex landscapes of disability in developing countries...|$|R

5|$|The <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old}} as the <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was {{a predator}}; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. Both {{are relevant to the}} <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> whether it was a hunter or a scavenger.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} {{motion to}} reopen the same-sex marriage debate failed. The 38th Canadian Parliament, led by the Liberals, had legalized same-sex marriage a year earlier. Several provinces had legalized same-sex marriage before that. During his campaign, Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion failed 175–123 leaving the same-sex marriage legal in Canada and the legal <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> it closed.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood.

5|$|Since devolution, {{in which}} other {{countries}} of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> how to counterbalance this in England.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I focus on dismissivism in metaphysics. Some {{philosophers}} argue {{that at least}} some metaphysical disputes are not substantial, and as a consequence should be dismissed. In this work I restrict my attention to metaphysics and focus on <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> existence and grounding. In particular I am interested in finding out whether {{there is a difference between}} the possible options available for dismissing <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what there is and the possible options available for dismissing <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what grounds what. I will delve into this in two different steps. First of all I explore the possibility to dismiss <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what there is, and as a case study I analyse the debate between three-dimensionalism and four-dimensionalism. Secondly I delve into whether it is possible to dismiss <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what grounds what, thanks to the discussion of another case study, i. e. the debate between tropes ontologies and universals ontologies. It is worth exploring the nature of dismissivism, because it bears on the future of philosophy. If philosophy has to have a future, we have to make sure {{that at least some}} disagreements within it are substantial. My conclusions will be that metaphysical <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what there is can be dismissed for a variety of reasons (semantic, epistemic, [...] .). I also argue there is no general formula to find out whether a specific debate should be dismissed. On the other hand I argue that <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> what grounds what should be dismissed. I offer two distinct arguments in favour of my claim. Firstly, I argue that disputants are having a verbal dispute when they talk about what grounds what, and thus their disagreement is non genuine. Secondly, I argue that the notion of grounding is underspecified, because it cannot be properly distinguished from causation...|$|R
