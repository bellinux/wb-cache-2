50|$|Associative and {{reflective}} processing mechanisms apply when cognitive vulnerability is processed into depression. The dual process model is valid {{in social and}} personality psychology but is not adapted to clinical phenomena. Negative bias in self-assessment provides a foundation for a cognitive vulnerability to depression. Then a downward spiral forms to create forms of dysphoria. Negatively biased associative processing will maintain a <b>dysphoric</b> <b>mood</b> state. As the <b>dysphoric</b> <b>mood</b> escalates, cognitive resources necessary to combating dysphoria by reflective processing are depleted. Irrelevant tasks and intrusive thoughts come to mind when in a <b>dysphoric</b> <b>mood,</b> and cognitive resource depletion further contributes to mood escalation.|$|E
50|$|Postponing the {{reflective}} processes leads to mood persistence. As the individual experiences {{more and more}} negative mood states, he or she becomes accustomed {{to a state of}} dysphoria. <b>Dysphoric</b> <b>moods</b> create more associative processing for depressive vulnerable people by negative cognitive biases. When associative bias gets stronger, the bias becomes difficult to override. Ineffective reflective strategies lead to persistence of <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods.</b>|$|R
40|$|A study {{involving}} 83 {{female and}} 72 male gamblers tested {{the direct and}} interactional effects of avoidance coping and five <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods</b> on problem gambling via regression analysis. Important {{differences were found between}} female and male gamblers. For female gamblers, loneliness, boredom, anxiety, depression and avoidance coping were all positively related to problem gambling. Additionally, interactions between these mood states and avoidance coping significantly predicted problem gambling; female gamblers with high dysphoria and high avoidance coping showed substantially more symptoms of problem gambling than those scoring high on only one variable. In contrast, loneliness and stress were the only significant predictors of problem gambling for males — neither avoidance coping nor any of the interactional relationships between mood and coping predicted problem gambling. These results support previous qualitative studies and suggest that female problem gamblers gamble as an escape from <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods.</b> Even though male problem gamblers expressed more negative affect than male non-problem gamblers, there was no evidence to suggest that negative mood was a precursor rather than an outcome of gambling behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Following up {{on earlier}} investigations, the present {{research}} aims to validate the construct impostor phenomenon by taking personality correlates into account and to examine whether the impostor phenomenon is a construct in its own right. In addition, gender effects as well as effects on working style and stress or strain are examined. In an online study we surveyed a sample of N = 242 individuals occupying leadership positions in different sectors. Confirmatory factor analyses provide empirical evidence for the discriminant validity of the impostor phenomenon. In accord with earlier studies we show that the impostor phenomenon is accompanied by higher levels of anxiety, <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods,</b> emotional instability and a generally negative self-evaluation. The study does not reveal any gender differences concerning the impostor phenomenon. With respect to working styles, persons with an impostor self-concept tend to show perfectionist as well as procrastinating behaviors. Moreover, they report being more stressed and strained by their work. In sum, the findings show that the impostor phenomenon constitutes a dysfunctional personality style.

40|$|Internet {{addiction}} is {{a rapidly growing}} field of research, receiving attention from researchers, journalists and policy makers. Despite much empirical data being collected and analyzed clear results and conclusions are surprisingly absent. This paper argues that conceptual issues and methodological shortcomings surrounding internet addiction research have made theoretical development difficult. An alternative model termed compensatory internet use is presented {{in an attempt to}} properly theorize the frequent assumption that people go online to escape real life issues or alleviate <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods</b> and that this sometimes leads to negative outcomes. An empirical approach to studying compensatory internet use is suggested by combining the psychological literature on internet addiction with research on motivations for internet use. The theoretical argument is that by understanding how motivations mediate the relationship between psychosocial well-being and internet addiction, we can draw conclusions about how online activities may compensate for psychosocial problems. This could help explain why some people keep spending so much time online despite experiencing negative outcomes. There is also a methodological argument suggesting that in order to accomplish this, research needs to move away from a focus on direct effects models and consider mediation and interaction effects between psychosocial well-being and motivations in the context of internet addiction. This is key to further exploring the notion of internet use as a coping strategy; a proposition often mentioned but rarely investigated...|$|R

In Study 1, participants with varying levels of <b>dysphoric</b> and/or anxious <b>mood</b> were exposed to a brief intervention either to increase or to reduce engagement in personal goal pursuit, under the hypothesis that dysphoria indicates under-engagement of the promotion system whereas anxiety indicates over-engagement of the prevention system. In Study 2, participants with varying levels of <b>dysphoric</b> and/or anxious <b>mood</b> received brief training in counterfactual thinking, under the hypothesis that inducing individuals {{in a state of}} promotion failure to generate subtractive counterfactuals for past failures (a non-fit) will lessen their dejection/depression-related symptoms, whereas inducing individuals in a state of prevention failure to generate additive counterfactuals for past failures (a non-fit) will lessen their agitation/anxiety-related symptoms.

40|$|The present {{series of}} studies {{investigated}} the relationship between emotional reasoning and depression. Emotional reasoning, a feature of cognitive models of emotional disorders, refers to the tendency to form interpretations based upon ones emotional state, as opposed to objective information. Studies 1, 2, and 3 a used a procedure adapted from previous research to determine whether emotional reasoning characterises dysphoria and depression. The findings suggested that almost all individuals engage in emotional reasoning and that, although self-referent emotional reasoning may characterise <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods,</b> clinically depressed individuals do not engage in emotional reasoning {{to a greater extent}} than non-depressed individuals. Studies 2 and 3 b investigated the prospective relationships between emotional reasoning and depressive symptoms across 8 week and 6 month intervals, respectively. The results of these studies suggested that emotional reasoning does not predict subsequent depressive symptoms. The findings of Study 4 a and 4 b, which investigated a similar tendency, intrusion-based reasoning, indicated that the interpretations of dysphoric and depressed individuals are not exclusively influenced by emotional states, but also by intrusive autobiographical memories. Studies 5 and 6 aimed to develop improved measures of emotional reasoning. Scores on a new self-report measure of emotional reasoning were not associated with scores obtained using the established procedure, and a mood induction procedure used in Study 6 provided results that were inconsistent with those of Studies 1, 2, and 3 a, in that few individuals appeared to engage in emotional reasoning. Finally, as a preliminary step towards translating lab-based research to a clinical setting, Study 7 investigated whether emotional reasoning tendencies change during the course of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Although anxiety and depressive symptoms improved with treatment, emotional reasoning scores remained stable, indicating that established CBT approaches may not address emotional reasoning tendencies. Together, the findings across these studies highlight the apparent ubiquity of emotional reasoning and indicate that it is marginally, if at all, elevated in depression. Numerous methodological questions are raised by the research and the results of these studies undermine cognitive models of psychopathology that suggest emotional reasoning characterises and contributes to depression...|$|R

5000|$|Absence of felt {{interpersonal}} {{safety in}} patients.

40|$|Background: Mood {{is defined}} as a ‘background’ {{emotional}} state that “rises and dissipates slowly” (Beedie, Terry, & Lane, 2005, p. 871). A person’s mood influences the ability to learn information and then apply it to other contexts (i. e. analogical transfer). Previous studies indicated that persons in a euphoric (“happy”) mood process information differently than persons in a <b>dysphoric</b> (“unhappy”) <b>mood</b> (Bless, Clore, Schwarz, Golisano, Rabe, & Wolk, 1996). Individuals in a euphoric state appear to be better at analogical transfer (Brand & Opwis, 2007). In this study, we consider the extent to which prior knowledge affects mood-contingent performance in an analogous Tower of Hanoi task. Method: There were four conditions (1) : Euphoric-Expert, (2) Dysphoric-Expert, (3) Euphoric-Nonexpert, (4) Dysphoric-Nonexpert. “Euphoric” individuals were shown a 10 minute excerpt from a comedy. “Dysphoric” individuals were shown a 10 minute excerpt about a nuclear war attack. There were four manipulation checks during the study to guage the participant’s mood (“Affect Grid”, Russell, Weiss, & Mendelsohn, 1989). In the “expert” condition, the participant played the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) game (Kotovsky & Fallside, 1989) and then played an obfuscatory isomorph of the TOH called the “Bear-God task” (cf. Hayes & Simon, 1974). In the “nonexpert” condition, the procedure was the same, except that the participant played the “Missionary and Cannibal” game (Thomas, 1974) – a game with a different set of rules from the TOH. Here, the participant plays the “Bear-God task” without an opportunity to transfer the principles from the earlier game. Results: The prediction is that mood will enhance analogical transfer. Interpretations and implications: The results have implications for many learning situations, including that of the role of mood in transmitting religious information successfully and ensuring that people apply the information to all aspects of their live...|$|R

Thus, all sympathomimetic amines fall into the larger group of stimulants (see psychoactive drug chart). In addition to intended therapeutic use, many of these stimulants have abuse potential, can induce tolerance, and possibly physical dependence, although not by the same mechanism(s) as opioids or sedatives. The symptoms of physical withdrawal from stimulants can include fatigue, <b>dysphoric</b> <b>mood,</b> increased appetite, vivid or lucid dreams, hypersomnia or insomnia, increased movement or decreased movement, anxiety, and drug craving, as is apparent in the rebound withdrawal from certain substituted amphetamines. Physical withdrawal from some sedatives can be potentially lethal, for instance benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Opioid withdrawal is very uncomfortable, often described as a bad case of the flu, with possibly severe abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as central symptoms, but it is rarely lethal unless the user has a comorbid condition.|$|E
5000|$|The citizen may voluntarily {{come to a}} {{psychiatrist}} who would find a severe mental disorder that requires the mandatory admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit. If the patient refuses the hospitalization offered to him, the doctor gets the right to start the procedure of involuntary hospitalization. As {{a psychiatrist}} says, {{it is only a}} psychiatrist who is able to inquire into a patient’s condition and to decide whether his refusal to be treated is a free man’s conscious choice or a symptom of a mental disorder. In psychiatrist’s opinion, the mentally ill often do not feel and do not deem they are ill. They actively avoid therapy and resist all efforts to subject them to it. The more the person resists the inpatient psychiatric ward’s demands for his hospitalization, the greater are his chances to find himself indoors or, more precisely, to be left there, because his resistance can be presented by the ward representatives as the lack of his due insight into mental status, as an indication of the severity of his disease. In the same vein, the practice was justified by American psychiatrist Benjamin Rush as early as the eighteenth century: [...] "The more they resist our efforts to serve them, the more they have need of our services." [...] The reluctance of patients to undergo neuroleptic treatment, their [...] "spontaneous irritation", protests, etc. are considered as either unremoved symptoms of mental illness (such as depressive neurosis) or, along with tremor, anxiety, <b>dysphoric</b> <b>mood</b> disorder, as [...] "transitory complications". It is profitable for doctors to hospitalize the person in any cases, then bedspace fills up. Remuneration of the labour of physicians in psychiatric hospitals and funding of the entire industry in Russia are carried out {{on the basis of the}} number of beds run by the doctor. Russian human rights activist Valery Abramkin says it should be clear for a Russian patient that each medic legally and illegally snatches his large sum from each bed. However, psychiatrists in their usual way counter the remarks that their funding depends on the number of psychiatric beds by ascribing them to antipsychiatrists and stating that the main motto of antipsychiatrists is the idea that psychiatrists are villains who dream of placing as many people as possible to madhouses.|$|E

Rates of drug abuse/dependence also appear to be high in bipolar patients ranging in reports from 8 - 60 % (Brady & Sonne, 1995).

40|$|The potent {{analgesic}} property of acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen makes these {{the most commonly}} used analgesics in the world. Easy accessibility and cost effectiveness of these agents are attractive to patients seeking pain relief. However, the abuse of nonnarcotic analgesics such as acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid by alcoholics and patients seeking to relieve <b>dysphoric</b> <b>moods</b> is well documented. These agents therefore impact on the brain neurotransmitter levels and therefore all processes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of neurotransmitters may be affected. The use of non-narcotic analgesics has been reported to reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mode of action by which acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen elicit neuroprotection is however unclear as many mechanisms of action have been inconclusively postulated. The first part of this study aims to elucidate the various mechanisms by which acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen affect the enzymes responsible for the catabolism of tryptophan, which is a precursor for the mood elevating neurotransmitter serotonin, as well as to investigate whether these agents alter the interplay between serotonin and pineal indole metabolism. The second part of this study focuses on the neuroprotective properties of acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen utilizing the neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, quinolinic acid and the potent Parkinsonian neurotoxin, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+). The ability of acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen to alter TRP metabolism was determined by investigating the effects of these agents on the primary enzymes of the kynurenine pathway i. e. tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase and indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase as well as to investigate whether these agents would have any effects on 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase. 3 -Hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of quinolinic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen alter tryptophan metabolism by inhibiting tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase and indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase thus increasing the availability of tryptophan for the production of serotonin. Acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen also inhibit 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase thus implying that these agents could reduce quinolinic acid production. Acetaminophen administration in rats induces a rise in serotonin and norepinephrine in the forebrain. Acetylsalicylic acid curtails the acetaminophen-induced rise in brain norepinephrine levels as well as enhances serotonin metabolism, indicating that analgesic preparations containing both agents would be advantageous, as this would prevent acetaminophen-induced mood elevation. The results from the pineal indole metabolism study show that acetylsalicylic acid enhances pineal metabolism of serotonin whereas acetaminophen induces an increase in melatonin levels in the pineal gland. Neuronal damage due to oxidative stress has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. The second part of the study aims to elucidate and characterize the mechanism by which acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen afford neuroprotection. The hippocampus is an important region of the brain responsible for memory. Agents such as quinolinic acid that are known to induce stress in this area have detrimental effects and could lead to various types of dementia. The striatum is also a vulnerable region to oxidative stress and hence (MPP+), which is toxic for this particular region of the brain, was also used as a neurotoxin. The results show that ASA and acetaminophen alone and in combination, are potent superoxide anion scavengers. In addition, the results imply that these agents offer protection against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation induced by several neurotoxins in rat brain particularly, the hippocampus and striatum. Histological studies, using Nissl staining and Acid fuchsin, show that acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen are able to protect hippocampal neurons against quinolinic acidinduced necrotic cell death. Immunohistochemical investigations show that QA induces apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus, which is inhibited by ASA and acetaminophen. In addition, ASA and acetaminophen inhibited MPP+ induced apoptotic cell death in the rat striatum. The study also sought to elucidate possible mechanisms by which ASA and acetaminophen exert neuroprotective effects in the presence of MPP+ as these agents are shown to prevent the MPP+-induced reduction in dopamine levels. The results show that acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen inhibit the action of this neurotoxin on the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a common source of free radicals in the cell. In addition, these agents were shown to block the neurotoxic effects of MPP+ on the enzymatic defence system of the brain i. e. superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. The reduction in glutathione levels induced by MPP+ is significantly inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen. The results imply that these agents are capable of not only scavenging free radicals but also enhance the cell defence mechanism against toxicity in the presence of MPP+. These agents also block the MPP+-induced inhibition of dopamine uptake into the cell. This would therefore reduce auto-oxidation of dopamine thus implying another mechanism by which these agents exert a neuroprotective role in MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. The discovery of neuroprotective properties of acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen is important considering the high usage of these agents and the increased incidence in neurological disorders. The findings of this thesis point to the need for clinical studies to be conducted as the results show acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen to have a definite role to play as antioxidants. This study therefore provides novel information regarding the neuroprotective effects of these agents and favours the use of these agents in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD, in which oxidative stress is implicated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Early and {{frequent}} cannabis use {{are associated with}} an increased likelihood of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We identify associations between aspects of cannabis use, MDD, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours and examine whether such associations persist after accounting for those predisposing factors, including genetic liability and early family environment, that are shared by identical twins who are discordant for cannabis exposure. Any residual association in such identical pairs might be indicative of individual-specific pathways that might be of a causal nature. Methods: We did a logistic regression analysis of cannabis use from retrospective data on same-sex male and female twin pairs drawn from 3 studies that had recruited twins from the Australian Twin Registry, 1992 – 93 (sample 1), 1996 – 2000 (sample 2), and 2005 – 09 (sample 3). We studied associations between early use {{and frequent}} use of cannabis and MDD, suicidal ideation (ever and persistent), and suicide plan and attempt in the full sample as well as in pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins that were discordant for each measure of cannabis involvement at a single timepoint. Significant monozygotic associations were further adjusted for covariates, such as early alcohol or nicotine use, early <b>dysphoric</b> or anhedonic <b>mood,</b> conduct disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Interactions between each cannabis measure and sex, sample or study effects, and birth year category were also examined as covariates. Findings: In 13   986 twins (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic), cannabis use ranged from 1345 (30 · 4 %) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 2275 (69 · 0 %) of 3299 in sample 3. Mean age of first cannabis use ranged from 17 · 9 years (SD 3 · 3) in sample 3 to 21 · 1 years (5 · 2) in sample 1, and frequent use (≥ 100 times) was reported by 214 (15 · 9 %) of 1345 users in sample 1 and 499 (21 · 9 %) of 2275 in sample 3. The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 1102 (24 · 9 %) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 1644 (26 · 3 %) of 6255 people in sample 2 and 865 (26 · 2 %) of 3299 people in sample 3. Prevalence of MDD ranged from 901 (20 · 3 %) people in sample 1 to 1773 (28 · 3 %) in sample 2. The monozygotic twin who used cannabis frequently was more likely to report MDD (odds ratio 1 · 98, 95 % CI 1 · 11 – 3 · 53) and suicidal ideation (2 · 47, 1 · 19 – 5 · 10) compared with their identical twin who had used cannabis less frequently, even after adjustment for covariates. For early cannabis use, the monozygotic point estimate was not significant but could be equated to the significant dizygotic estimate, suggesting a possible association with suicidal ideation. Interpretation: The increased likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users cannot be solely attributed to common predisposing factors...|$|R
