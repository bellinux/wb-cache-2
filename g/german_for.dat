5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (<b>German</b> <b>for</b> goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Anderson was {{institutionalized}} in {{a mental}} hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (<b>German</b> <b>for</b> Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family {{and those who had}} known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.|$|E
