40|$|A {{bi-directional}} Joule Thomson refrigerator is described, {{which is}} of simple construction at the cold end of the refrigerator. Compressed gas flowing in either direction through the Joule Thomson <b>expander</b> <b>valve</b> and becoming liquid, is captured in a container in direct continuous contact with the heat load. The Joule Thomson valve is responsive to {{the temperature of the}} working fluid near the valve, to vary the flow resistance through the valve so as to maintain a generally constant flow mass between the time that the refrigerator is first turned on and the fluid is warm, and the time when the refrigerator is near its coldest temperature and the fluid is cold. The valve is operated by differences in thermal coefficients of expansion of materials to squeeze and release a small tube which acts as the <b>expander</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend for}} ever {{increasing}} energy prices {{acts as an}} important driver for improved efficiency via novel heat integration and energy generation schemes. This project is concerned with small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) engines for power generation, primarily {{for use in the}} domestic sector and in small industrial plants, in conjunction with solar collection and/or waste heat recovery. The reciprocating expander is a low-cost, low-maintenance, and readily available prime mover option for these engines, with promising performance characteristics (e. g. efficiency). An experimental test-bed is devised to study the efficiency and performance of a reciprocating piston-expander, operating with working fluids such as R 245 fa. This test-bed has a thermal power output of up to 20 kWth giving a maximum mechanical output of 3 kWe, with the inlet pressure of the working fluid limited to 10 bar. The tested expander is based on a commercially available unit intended for air compression applications, and is reconditioned {{for the purposes of the}} present test. Special consideration was given to the development of the <b>expander</b> <b>valves.</b> In addition basic cycle analysis and optimization is conducted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{simulate}} the transient behaviors of a newly developed 2 kW helium refrigerator, a numerical model of the critical equipment including a screw compressor with variable-frequency drive, plate-fin heat exchangers, a turbine <b>expander,</b> and pneumatic <b>valves</b> wasdeveloped. In the simulation,the calculation of the helium thermodynamic properties arebased on 32 -parameter modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (MBWR) state equation. The start-up process of the warm compressor station with gas management subsystem, and the cool-down process of cold box in an actual operation, were dynamically simulated. The developed model was verified by comparing the simulated results with the experimental data. Besides, system responses of increasing heat load were simulated. This model {{can also be used}} to design and optimize other large scale helium refrigerators...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} reciprocating expander {{was designed}} with features appropriate for cryocooler cycles. The expander has a displacer piston, simple valves, and a hydraulic/pneumatic stroking mechanism. The <b>expander</b> has a <b>valve</b> in head configuration with the valves extending out {{the bottom of}} the vacuum enclosure while the piston extends out the top. The expander was tested using a CTI 1400 liquefier to supply 13 atm in the temperature range 4. 2 to 12 K. Expander efficiency was measured in the range 84 to 93 % while operating the apparatus as a supercritical wet expander and in the range 91 to 93 % aa a single phase expander. The apparatus can also be modified to operate as a compressor for saturated helium vapor...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{internal}} heat exchanger (IHE) {{on the performance of}} the transcritical carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle with an expander is analyzed theoretically {{on the basis of the}} first and second laws of thermodynamics. The possible parameters affecting system efficiency such as heat rejection pressure, gas cooler outlet temperature, evaporating temperature, expander isentropic efficiency and IHE effectiveness are investigated. It is found that the IHE addition in the carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle with an expander increases the specific cooling capacity and compression work, and decreases the optimum heat rejection pressure and the expander output power. An IHE addition does not always improve the system performance in the refrigeration cycle with an <b>expander.</b> The throttle <b>valve</b> cycle with IHE provides a 5. 6 % to 17 % increase in maximum COP compared to that of the basic cycle. For the ideal expander cycle with IHE, the maximum COP is approximately 12. 3 % to 16. 1 % lower than the maximum COP of the cycle without IHE. Whether the energy efficiency of the cycle by IHE can be improved depends on the isentropic efficiency level of the expander. The use of IHE is only applicable in the cases of lower expander isentropic efficiencies or higher gas cooler exit temperatures for the refrigeration cycle with an expander from the view of energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} four existing {{gaps and}} missing {{facilities in the}} route to improve the capabilities to model an entire oil and gas field extending from the reservoir to the field sales point. Such a model, referred by {{the oil and gas}} industry as Integrated Asset Model (IAM), enables mathematical assessments of the trade-offs between design, operational alternatives and mathematical optimization subject to the entire system constraints. The gaps and issues addressed are divided into the following chapters: Chapter 1 - Describes the basics of the IAM approach and software packages throughout used in this research. Chapter 2 - Describes a methodology to develop a low cost field simulator tool where coupling a hydrocarbon production system, from reservoir to the sales point is presented. A gas-condensate reservoir has been chosen, scaled-up by previous researchers. The study undertakes a compositional characterization of the reservoir fluids, and calculations of flow in reservoir, wells, surface network, and LNG plant. Some of the challenges faced have been the coupling and transfer of information of thermodynamic models and fluid properties from the reservoir to the production network system. Linking reservoir and process simulator to get a field production simulator can be a very useful tool but it still need to be improved on running the simulator for each Reservoir time step and Process Simulator and reservoir fluid updates before moving to the next reservoir time step. Chapter 3 - Proposes the development of a tool inside the Process Simulator Hysys that applies the Huntington method (1985) for calculation of a subsea compressor polytropic head (Wet Gas Compressor). The current methods available in the process simulator Hysys are valid only for dry gas. For wet gas these models fail. Previous authors(For example Hundseid 2006 - 2008) have worked on the topic before but none of them developed it as a routine and made available as a tool in the process simulator where it is easier to use even for those that are not familiar with the complex calculations. Implementing a routine in the process simulator, would make available a tool for wet gas compressor calculation. Chapter 4 - Presents a model-based study for accelerated production of an oil field. It combines two mature Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies: Miscible of Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection and a down hole Electric Submersible Pump (ESP). The field used as test case was a Multi-well oil field undergoing WAG, originally studied by Killough and Kossack (1987). The integrated approach proposed for field production strategy with the ESP is relevant with regard to the achievable early production. Gas-Alternating-Water recovery method with the installation of an ESP has shown accelerating oil recovery although the investment costs can be high Chapter 5 - Deals with the fluid dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of Chokes. The first part of the chapter presents predictions of the outlet temperature. Different combinations of thermodynamic processes, containing <b>expanders</b> and <b>valves,</b> have been considered to identify the configuration that better represents the experimental data (gathered by a previous researcher) in a process simulator. There are recognized areas governed by gas, oil and water, and some differences among the configurations of the model. It was observed that the pressure drop across the Choke is not fully isenthalpic as there was enthalpy variation. The biggest variation was observed in the gas dominated zone. The second part of the chapter deals with the prediction of mass flow from wells using chokes, based on available inlet and outlet measurements –pressure and temperature. The simple Bernoulli equation adapted for multiphase outperformed some of well known models used in {{the oil and gas industry}}. Because of its good performance, this new technology could reduce costs with the installation of physical multiphase flowmeters in subsea wells. With those models included in an IAM tool a reliable and low-cost tool can be available for field development studies, field planning and operations...|$|R
