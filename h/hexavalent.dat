5|$|While {{chromium}} metal and Cr(III) ions {{are not considered}} toxic, <b>hexavalent</b> chromium (Cr(VI)) is toxic and carcinogenic. Abandoned chromium production sites often require environmental cleanup.|$|E
5|$|Because {{chromium}} compounds {{were used}} in dyes, paints, and leather tanning compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and groundwater at abandoned industrial sites, now needing environmental cleanup and remediation. Primer paint containing <b>hexavalent</b> chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. <b>Hexavalent</b> chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its <b>hexavalent</b> form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, <b>hexavalent</b> chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the <b>hexavalent</b> form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Environmental Working Group {{studied the}} {{drinking}} water in 35 American cities in the first nationwide study. The study found measurable <b>hexavalent</b> chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with Norman, Oklahoma, {{at the top of}} list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit. Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution, as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in the EWG report.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, <b>hexavalent</b> chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and <b>hexavalent</b> actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed <b>hexavalent</b> chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trivalent}} chromium is {{far less}} poisonous than <b>hexavalent,</b> chromium salts are generally considered toxic.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{to the use}} of PCC is its toxicity, {{which it}} shares with other <b>hexavalent</b> chromium compounds.|$|E
25|$|Phosphate is {{a strong}} {{complexing}} agent for the <b>hexavalent</b> uranyl (UO22+) species; for this reason, apatite and other natural phosphates can be very rich in uranium.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} (UO3), {{also called}} uranyl oxide, uranium(VI) oxide, and uranic oxide, is the <b>hexavalent</b> oxide of uranium. The solid {{may be obtained}} by heating uranyl nitrate to 400°C. Its most commonly encountered polymorph, γ-UO3, is a yellow-orange powder.|$|E
25|$|The town of Hinkley, California (U.S.), had its {{groundwater}} {{contaminated with}} <b>hexavalent</b> chromium starting in 1952, {{resulting in a}} legal case against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) and a multimillion-dollar settlement in 1996. The legal case was dramatized in the film Erin Brockovich, released in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{dichromate}} paper {{can be used}} to test for sulfur dioxide, as it turns distinctively from orange to green. This is typical of all redox reactions where <b>hexavalent</b> chromium is reduced to trivalent chromium. Therefore, it is not a conclusive test for sulfur dioxide. The final product formed is Cr2(SO4)3.|$|E
25|$|Constituents {{depend upon}} the {{specific}} coal bed makeup but may include {{one or more of}} the following elements or substances found in trace concentrations (up to hundreds ppm): arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, <b>hexavalent</b> chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium, along with very small concentrations of dioxins and PAH compounds.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option for}} infants is DT {{which is a}} vaccine that is a {{combination}} of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This is given as an alternative to infants who have conflicts with the DTaP vaccine. Quadrivalent, pentavalent, and <b>hexavalent</b> formulations contain DTaP with {{one or more of the}} additional vaccines: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, Hepatitis B, with the availability varying in different countries.|$|E
25|$|Like all <b>hexavalent</b> uranium compounds, UO3 is {{hazardous}} by inhalation, ingestion, {{and through}} skin contact. It is a poisonous, slightly radioactive substance, which may cause shortness of breath, coughing, acute arterial lesions, {{and changes in}} the chromosomes of white blood cells and gonads leading to congenital malformations if inhaled. However, once ingested, uranium is mainly toxic for the kidneys and may severely affect their function.|$|E
25|$|Recycling {{computing}} equipment can keep harmful {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and <b>hexavalent</b> chromium out of landfills, and can also replace equipment that otherwise {{would need to be}} manufactured, saving further energy and emissions. Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations. However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment. Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets and municipal or private recycling centers. Computing supplies, such as printer cartridges, paper, and batteries may be recycled as well.|$|E
25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic <b>hexavalent</b> chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{second step}} was to {{separate}} the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was {{very similar to the}} lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the <b>hexavalent</b> state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. <b>Hexavalent</b> uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
500|$|Np(VI) or , the neptunyl ion, shows a light pink or reddish {{color in}} an acidic {{solution}} and yellow-green otherwise. It {{is a strong}} Lewis acid and is the main neptunium ion encountered in solutions of pH3–4. Though stable in acidic solutions, it is quite easily reduced to the Np(V) ion, {{and it is not}} as stable as the homologous <b>hexavalent</b> ions of its neighbours uranium and plutonium (the uranyl and plutonyl ions). It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form the oxo and hydroxo ions NpO2OH+, , and [...]|$|E
500|$|All {{pentavalent}} and <b>hexavalent</b> americium compounds {{are complex}} salts such as KAmO2F2, Li3AmO4 and Li6AmO6, Ba3AmO6, AmO2F2. These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) {{can be prepared}} from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, with silver(I) oxide in perchloric acid, or with ozone or sodium persulfate in sodium carbonate solutions. The pentavalent oxidation state of americium was first observed in 1951. It is present in aqueous solution {{in the form of}} [...] ions (acidic) or [...] ions (alkaline) which are however unstable and subject to several rapid disproportionation reactions: ...|$|E
500|$|Chromium(III) salts, {{especially}} {{chrome alum}} and chromium(III) sulfate, {{are used in}} the tanning of leather. The chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers. Chromium tanned leather can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium, which is tightly bound to the proteins. Although the form of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic <b>hexavalent</b> variety, there remains interest in management of chromium in the tanning industry such as recovery and reuse, direct/indirect recycling, use of less chromium or [...] "chrome-less" [...] tanning are practiced to better manage chromium in tanning.|$|E
500|$|Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, {{the last}} being most stable. In the <b>hexavalent</b> state, uranium {{is very similar}} to the group 6 elements. Many {{compounds}} of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are non-stoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2+x, where x varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak oxidants. Most of them contain the linear [...] "uranyl" [...] group, [...] Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. [...] and [...] are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as UIII(C5H5)3 and UIV(C5H5)4.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. Not until May 1943 would DuPont managers decide {{to use the}} bismuth phosphate process in preference to one using lanthanum fluoride. The bismuth phosphate process was devised by [...] Stanley G. Thompson at the University of California. Plutonium had two oxidation states; a tetravalent (+4) state, and <b>hexavalent</b> (+6) state, with [...] different chemical properties. Bismuth phosphate (...) was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate, and plutonium would be carried with bismuth phosphate in a solution while other elements, including uranium, would be precipitated. The plutonium could be switched from being in solution to being precipitated by toggling its oxidation state. The plant consisted of six cells, separated {{from each other and}} the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated from the control room by remote control due to the radioactivity produced by fission products. Work was completed on 26 November 1943, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs.|$|E
500|$|Normal {{functioning}} of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers. [...] Uranyl (...) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other <b>hexavalent</b> uranium compounds, {{have been shown to}} cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Like other chromium(VI) {{compounds}} (chromium trioxide, sodium dichromate), {{potassium dichromate}} {{has been used}} to prepare [...] "chromic acid" [...] for cleaning glassware and etching materials. [...] Because of safety concerns associated with <b>hexavalent</b> chromium, this practice has been largely discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency has {{identified}} Garfield {{as the site}} of groundwater contaminated <b>hexavalent</b> chromium from a spill in 1983 at the E.C. Electroplating Corporation site. In 2016, the EPA announced a $37 million project to cleanup contamination at the site using Superfund money, as the company responsible for the spill of [...] of chromic acid is no longer in business.|$|E
2500|$|Portland cement is caustic, so it {{can cause}} {{chemical}} burns. [...] The powder can cause irritation or, with severe exposure, lung cancer, and can contain some hazardous components; such as crystalline silica and <b>hexavalent</b> chromium. Environmental concerns are the high energy consumption required to mine, manufacture, and transport the cement; and the related air pollution, including the release of greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide), dioxin, NOx, SO2, and particulates.|$|E
2500|$|Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is {{a common}} {{inorganic}} chemical reagent, most commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various laboratory and industrial applications. As with all <b>hexavalent</b> chromium compounds, it is acutely and chronically harmful to health. It is a crystalline ionic solid with a very bright, red-orange color. [...] The salt is popular in the laboratory {{because it is not}} deliquescent, in contrast to the more industrially relevant salt sodium dichromate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lanthanum}} fluoride process {{became the}} preferred method {{for use in}} the Manhattan Project's plutonium separation [...] at the Clinton Engineer Works and the production facilities at the Hanford Site but further work with the process revealed difficulties. It required large amounts of hydrogen fluoride, which corroded the equipment and Charles M. Cooper from DuPont, who would be responsible for the design and construction of the facilities, began experiencing problems with stabilizing the plutonium in its <b>hexavalent</b> state in the fluoride solution. There were also difficulties with recovering the precipitate through filtration or centrifugation.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{gas masks}} are quite safe {{and do not}} use asbestos, {{but it is still}} {{important}} to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box [...] "modern type" [...] masks can be cracked and leak. Also, the U.S C2 canister (black) was shown to contain <b>hexavalent</b> chromium: the studies by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, as it is a carcinogen.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "crossover" [...] step, the {{lanthanum}} fluoride {{process was}} used. Lanthanum salts and hydrogen fluoride were added again and lanthanum fluoride was precipitated, while <b>hexavalent</b> plutonium {{was left in}} solution. [...] This removed lanthanides like cerium, strontium and lanthanum, that bismuth phosphate could not. The plutonium was again reduced with oxalic acid and the lanthanum fluoride process was repeated. This time potassium hydroxide was added to metathesize the solution. Liquid was removed with a centrifuge and the solid dissolved in nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate. At this point, a [...] batch sent would have been concentrated to [...]|$|E
2500|$|John E. Willard tried an {{alternative}} approach, {{based on the}} fact that some silicates absorbed plutonium more readily than other elements; this was found to work but with low efficiency. Theodore T. Magel and Daniel K. Koshland, Jr., researched a solvent-extraction processes and Harrison Brown and Orville F. Hill experimented with separation using volatility reactions, based on how uranium could be readily volatilized by fluorine. They and other chemists at the Manhattan Project's Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, [...] Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago and Ames Laboratory at Iowa State College, explored plutonium chemistry. A crucial discovery was that plutonium had two oxidation states, a tetravalent (+4) state and <b>hexavalent</b> (+6) state. with different chemical properties.|$|E
