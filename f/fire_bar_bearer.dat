30|$|Guard rails were {{installed}} over {{the length of}} the track bridge to prevent wheel derailment. The addition of the guard rails also had the effect of stiffening the frame made up of the rails and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars,</b> thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The guard rails were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> using machined pins, and connected to the guard rail of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the guard rails in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R
30|$|Figure  6 b {{shows the}} ends of the {{floating}} and transition spans in the sagging curve deformed configuration, i.e., when the lake level is below the neutral position. If the rectangular planes (the floating and transition spans) rotate relative to each other along hinge line DD’, the ends B and B’ of the wings will rise and the wings will rotate about their longitudinal edges, namely axes AB* and A’B’*, in order to maintain contact with the spans at points C and C'. As the wing ABC rotates, the arc will rotate about the chord line AB* so that it is no longer in the horizontal plane. The bearings that are placed along the arc, and the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> that rest on them, will therefore move vertically. The <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> are free to slide transversely on the bearings through a limited distance, and the rails that rest on them adopt a vertically curved shape equal to the vertical component of the arc on the rotated wing. The bearings can be placed at any spacing on the wing, so any degree of support can be provided to the rails while forcing them to go through the desired vertical curvature. If the wings and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> were infinitely stiff, the rails would be supported rigidly at each <b>bearer</b> <b>bar</b> and the vertical curve of the track would be the one defined by the rotated arc. In practice, they will have some flexibility, so the shape of the track will differ slightly from the idealized shape computed in the following sections.|$|R

30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} yaw movement, part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (longitudinal) rails and the (transverse) <b>bearer</b> <b>bars.</b> The fasteners that connect the rails to the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the track panel provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|R

30|$|The <b>bearer</b> <b>bar</b> support {{bearings}} must allow for rotation about all three axes, {{with the largest}} motions likely about the longitudinal axis of the bridge.

Although this displacement is nominally a second-order effect, it is nonetheless large enough that provision must be made for it.|$|R
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the support {{bearings}} introduces small discontinuities in {{the slope of the}} rails at the ends of the CESuRa assembly. The use of lower-profile wings and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> reduces those discontinuities, but their lower stiffness increases deflections due to the passage of rail vehicles. Therefore, there is a balance to be drawn.|$|R

40|$|A indústria oleira nacional possui uma grande importância econômica e social, movimentando bilhões de reais e empregando milhões de pessoas. No entanto, apresenta uma grande defasagem tecnológica, o que se reflete na produção de peças de baixa qualidade e em uma grande quantidade de perdas na produção. Assim, visando melhorar a qualidade dos blocos cerâmicos esse trabalho tem por objetivo analisar a influência de aditivos no comportamento de plasticidade de massas para produção de blocos cerâmicos e nas propriedades físicas dos corpos produzidos com as massas aditivadas. Foram utilizados cinco massas industriais e dez aditivos durante o estudo. Foi analisada a influência dos aditivos nos limites de Atterberg das massas e selecionados os aditivos que reduziam os limites de plasticidade. Foram preparadas formulações com os aditivos selecionados e conformados corpos de prova por extrusão. Determinou-se o módulo de ruptura à flexão após secagem e queima e a absorção de água após queima desses corpos de prova. Com base nos resultados pode-se concluir que alguns aditivos reduzem o limite de plasticidade das massas e melhoram significativamente o comportamento mecânico após secagem e após queima. The Brazilian ceramic brick {{industry}} {{has an important}} economic and social role, with a billionaire market and generating millions of jobs. However, this industry presents an outdated technology, which causes the production of low quality bodies and high production losses. Objecting {{improve the quality of}} ceramic brick this work evaluated the influence of additives on the plasticity of formulations used for the production of ceramic bricks and on the physical properties of samples produced with additive formulations. Five formulations and ten additives were studied. The influence of additives on the Atterberg limits was analyzed. Additives that reduced the plasticity limit were selected, formulations were produced and test specimens were obtained by extrusion. The flexural strength of the dried and <b>fired</b> <b>bars</b> was measured. The water absorption of the <b>fired</b> <b>bars</b> was also determined. The results indicated that some additives could be used to reduce the formulations plasticity limit and improve the flexural strength...|$|R
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the wing support {{bearings}} (due to the {{height of the}} wing girders, the FPS bearings, <b>bearer</b> <b>bars,</b> and rail fasteners) modifies the kinematics of the idealized system described previously. The twist of the wing girders leads to an additional vertical displacement of the yoke curves caused by the rigid body rotation of the wing girder, and the yoke curves translate toward or away from one another, depending on the direction of twist. A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces. These can both be considered second-order effects and were minimized in the floating bridge application by limiting {{the height of the}} components of the system. This was achieved by using a thin wing girder along the bearing yoke surface that was stiffened by an edge beam and coping the ends of the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> where they connected to the friction pendulum bearings.|$|R

40|$|Hippocampal slow {{waves and}} firing of theta cells were {{investigated}} during voluntary and automatic {{behaviors of the}} rat, including bar pressing on continuous reinforcement and fixed-ratio 50. Voluntary behaviors (walking, orienting, postural adjustments, approaching food or water, following the experimenter's hand, jumping, and exploring) were accompanied by theta in the slow waves and fast, rhythmical firing in the theta cells. For a given cell the rates of firing were similar for all voluntary behaviors. Automatic behaviors (eating, drinking, teeth chattering, grooming, vomiting, and yawning) were accompanied by irregular slow-wave activity and slow, irregular firing in the theta cells. For a given cell the rates of firing were similar for all automatic behaviors. Electrode placement within the hippocampus was critical with regard to how much slow-wave theta could be recorded during voluntary behaviors, whereas theta cells throughout the hippocampus were identical {{in the form of}} their <b>firing.</b> <b>Bar</b> pressing on both continuous reinforcement and fixed-ratio 50 gave clearly non-theta responses in both units and slow waves.

50|$|When Kelsey {{decided to}} leave the series, {{producers}} devised a dramatic exit storyline for his character. Special effects designer Ian Rowley set up a reconstruction of a fire. Half of the scenes were shot on location, while the rest were carried out in a studio. Instead of using their usual studios, Emmerdale opted to use Yorkshire Television's main Studio 3. At the time the fire was the largest fire ever undertaken with the company. A stuntman took Kelsey's place in various scenes. The location filming took place at Creskeld Hall, the actual setting of Home Farm and this was manned by Barbara Shaw. They built and extra storey to the building and installed <b>fire</b> <b>bars</b> which were manipulated to set the room alight. Producers had decided that they wanted a dramatic end for Dave's involvement with the fire. In the episode Dave is badly burnt by flaming curtains that fall onto him. During filming the stuntman was logistically placed and dodged the curtains and crawled away, creating the illusion that Dave is underneath them. They then launched a fireball through the window to complete the sequence, all of filming at Creskeld Hall was done in one take.|$|R
