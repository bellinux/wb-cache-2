40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare the environmental performance of conventional and organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> in Japan. We made comparisons between conventional and organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> at the farm level in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus surplus per hectare of farmland. To estimate the environmental loads associated with the application of nitrogen and phosphorus, we used the farm gate balance, which measured the difference between the nutrient content of farm inputs and the nutrient content of farm outputs. Five organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> in region A in Japan were analyzed in the present paper. They acquired the certification for organic roughage production in 2004 and started to produce certified organic milk in 2006. The results of the present paper are as follows. First, the nitrogen surplus per ha of the organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> system was lower than that of the conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> system. Second, the phosphorus surplus per ha of the organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> system was higher than that of the conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> {{sector is}} subject to several {{sustainability}} problems. This study investigates how these societal concerns, {{in the form of}} normative pressure, influence the transition of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime towards sustainability. Insights from the multi level perspective are used to describe the transition of the Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime. To study normative pressure, social movement theory is incorporated. The main research question is: How does normative pressure influence the transition towards sustainability of the Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime from 1990 until now? It can be concluded that normative pressure on <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> to produce more sustainable increased over the past decades. The topic of concern, however, changed over time. In some cases societal organizations directly influence sustainable <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> However, more often societal organizations influence market parties, via normative pressure, who in turn influence sustainable <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Sometimes, societal organizations also try to have an impact via the political/regulatory stream. Nonetheless, in the dairy sector, international policy makes it very hard to take actual measures, as the Netherlands have to commit to EU regulation. Therefore, Dutch policy makers have mainly an impact by stimulating market parties. All in all it seems in <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> normative pressure plays an important role to stimulate sustainable innovation...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} in two parts. In the first part, {{nitrogen}} (N) losses {{per unit of}} milk and meat in Danish conventional and organic pig and <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> were compared {{on the basis of}} farm data. In the second part, organic and conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> were compared in detail, using modelling. N-surpluses at different livestock densities, fodder intensities, and soil types were simulated. Finally, simulated N-surpluses were used in national scenarios for conversion to organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> in Denmark. In Part one, pig farming was found to have a higher N-efficiency than <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Organic pig production had a lower N-efficiency and a higher N-surplus per kg meat than conventional pig production. The possibilities to reduce N-loss by conversion to organic pig production therefore appear to be poor. Organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> had a higher N-efficiency and a lower N-surplus per kg milk than conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Conversion from conventional to organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> may therefore reduce N-losses. In Part two, a positive correlation between livestock density and N-surplus ha− 1 was found for <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> For all simulated livestock densities, fodder feeding intensities and soil types, organic systems showed a lower N-surplus per unit of milk produced than conventional systems. National scenarios for <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> showed that the present Danish milk production could be achieved with a 24 % lower total N-surplus if converted from intensive conventional farming to extensive organic farming.

5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage <b>Dairy</b> <b>Farm</b> and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E
5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, playing with his elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on a backyard pitch on the family's <b>dairy</b> <b>farm,</b> owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller.

This study compared the economic, environmental and societal impact of large-scale <b>farms</b> with other <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> in the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Moreover the integrated sustainable performance of large-scale <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> was explored.

To quantify societal performance, we used indicators on milk quality, cow lifetime and grazing hours. Large-scale <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> had a higher labour productivity and NFI than other <b>dairy</b> <b>farms,</b> without compromising on phosphorus surplus, energy use or ghg emission. Higher profits were accompanied by a lower solvency ratio on large-scale farms. Pesticides use, however, was higher on large-scale <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> due to a lower share of grassland.
