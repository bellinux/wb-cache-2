50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 17th century, Lehmann adapted the {{techniques}} of using copper and bronze wheels to engrave gems to <b>engrave</b> <b>glass.</b> Though both intaglio (Tiefschnitt, “deep cut”) and high relief (Hochschnitt, “high cut”) <b>engraving</b> on <b>glass</b> had been practiced since ancient times, Lehmann was the earliest modern <b>glass</b> <b>engraver</b> to develop an advanced technique and a personal style. His earliest dated work is a glass beaker, dated 1605. In 1609, he received an exclusive privilege from Emperor Rudolf II in Prague for <b>engraving</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

50|$|Franz Tieze (1842-1932) was a late 19th-century Dublin-based forger. An exiled Bohemian <b>glass</b> <b>engraver,</b> {{he worked}} in Dublin in the studios of the Pugh Brothers (Thomas and Richard Pugh) at The Potters Alley Glass Works, the only {{manufacturers}} of flint-glass in Ireland. Tieze had been recruited, with other Bohemian glass engravers, by the Pugh Brothers and he arrived in Dublin in 1865 to <b>engrave</b> <b>glass</b> in the 'antique style'.|$|R

50|$|Focussing {{of these}} plate cameras {{was by the}} use of a ground <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> at the point of focus. Because lens design only allowed rather small {{aperture}} lenses, the image on the ground <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the ground <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a dark slide. To make the exposure, the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced.|$|R
40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is <b>glass</b> <b>engraving</b> and notable people of the field. Dominik Biemann is {{according}} to my opinion a key if not a founding figure of <b>glass</b> <b>engraving.</b> Subsequent <b>glass</b> engravers managed to identify and update his contribution to modern arts. On a few selected works we briefly characterize the formation of three major contemporary engravers (Arno Čančík, Jaroslava Votrubová and Jiří Harcuba). More space is given to Jiří Harcuba and his art legacy, teaching and popularization work. A brief history of the developing Czech tradition of <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> in the twentieth century, with an overlap into the 21 st century, is discussed. Future engravers are highly affected by their training; therefore we have mentioned several Czech colleges specialized in training of glass engravers. The practical part is realized {{by a set of}} portraits and engravings that are inspired by the theoretical part of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The work {{consists}} {{of a set of}} six, utilitarian wine glasses. Each <b>glass</b> features the <b>engraving</b> of a bird silhouette; the six engravings represent a flock of birds and also six key-poses in the animated flight-cycle of one bird. Beside the array of wine <b>glasses</b> sits a <b>screen</b> on which is displayed a looped animation of this same bird in flight. In a way, the six wine glasses represent the six animation cels of the displayed animation. Additionally, each <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> serves as a sight-trigger for a smart-phone or other mobile device. If one has the Aurasma app on their device and holds it up to ‘look at’ any one of the engravings, the animation of the flying bird will also be displayed on their device’s screen...|$|R
