40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{the changes in the}} {{structure}} of Ukraine’s banking sector caused by the crisis 2008 – 2009. The research covers the pre-crisis stage (early 2008), the stage {{of the impact of the}} global financial crisis (end of 2008 – 2009), the stage of post-crisis development (2010 – 2013). The analysis is done in two areas: the analysis of the consequences of redistribution of responsibilities between the Deposit Guarantee Fund (the DGF) and the National Bank of Ukraine (the NBU) and the analysis of changes in the structure of the banking sector (the redistribution of the market between the four groups of banks in terms of assets, state-owned banks and other banks, foreign banks and domestic banks). It is possible to talk about the positive aspects arising from the redistribution of responsibilities between the NBU and the DGF, namely in terms of depositors’ protection strengthening due to reducing the term of the interim administration, eliminating the moratorium on payments to depositors etc. However, it is impossible to make an unambiguous conclusion that these changes have had a positive effect on the level of <b>depositor’s</b> <b>confidence</b> in banks. It turned out to be factors that are more important: economic and political situation in the country. The changes in the structure of the banking sector had a crucial character. Characteristic tendencies for each block of banks have been determined based on an analysis of indicators such as total assets, loans to legal entities and individuals, total liabilities, liabilities of legal entities and individuals, equity and equity multiplier. The financial crisis has revealed deep problems in the banking sector and has caused essential transformation processes: the redistribution of the banking market in favor of banks, which enjoyed the confidence of customers. Research shows that such banks in the unit of banks in terms of assets are banks of 2 and 4 groups; banks in the block by the presence of state ownership – PJSC ‘Oschadbank’, PJSC ‘Ukreximbank’; banks in the block by the presence of foreign capital – foreign banks...|$|R

50|$|In 1959, seven banks {{controlled}} by the erstwhile native states - including State Bank of Travancore - were nationalised by Government of India and made subsidiaries of State Bank of India. Towards {{the end of that}} year RBI, {{under the influence of the}} north Indian bankers' lobby, initiated a series of steps in Palai Central Bank. These steps, taken with the stated object of improving the Bank's working, were apparently aimed at wrecking the institution. It asked Joseph Augusti to retire from the board of directors of the Bank. Also, K M George was asked to step down from the post of chief executive officer and to continue as Secretary of the Bank. An outsider - an official of the State Bank of India - was appointed as the bank's new chief executive officer. Following these moves, some of the bank's <b>depositors</b> lost <b>confidence</b> in the institution and withdrew their deposits. Some people felt that RBI wanted to create a crisis in the Bank to facilitate its closure.

40|$|In a rational-expectations framework, we model depositors'' {{confidence}} as {{a function}} of the probability of future bank bailouts. We analyze the effect of alternative bank bailout policies on depositors'' confidence in an emerging market setting, where liquidity shortages of banks are revealed sequentially and governments cannot credibly commit to bailing out all potentially distressed banks. Our findings suggest that allowing early bank failures and using available liquidity for credible commitments to later bailouts can better boost confidence than early bailouts. This conclusion arises because with a high chance of liquidity shortage in the future, <b>depositors</b> may lose <b>confidence</b> and hence withdraw deposits even from potentially sound banks. Such a policy of late bailouts is likely to receive political support when a full bailout needs to be financed by taxation.

40|$|Should {{we expect}} deposit {{insurance}} {{to have a}} positive effect on development of the financial sector? All insurance pools individual risks: premiums are paid into a fund from which losses are met. In most circumstances, a residual claimant to the fund (typically a private insurance company) loses money when losses exceed premiums. Claimants that underprice risk tend to go bankrupt. With most deposit insurance, however, the residual claimant is a government agency with very different incentives. If the premiums paid by member banks cannot cover current fund expenditures, the taxpayer makes up the shortfall. Facing little threat of insolvency, there is less incentive for administrative agencies to price risk accurately. In the United States, researchers have found that the combination of increasing competition in banking services and underpriced deposit insurance led to riskier banking portfolios without commensurate increases in bank capital. Deposit insurance may facilitate risk-taking, with negative consequences for the health of the financial system. On the positive side, insurance may give <b>depositors</b> increased <b>confidence</b> in the formal financial sector [...] which may decrease the likelihood of bank runs and increase financial depth. Indeed, simple bivariate correlations between explicit insurance and financial depth are positive. But when one also controls for income and inflation, that relationship disappears [...] in fact, the partial correlation between changes in subsequent financial depth and the adoption of explicit insurance is negative (and quite pronounced). Counterintuitive though it may be, that stylized fact may be partially explained by the political and economic factors that motivated the decision to establish an explicit scheme. The circumstances surrounding decisions about deposit insurance are associated with different movements in subsequent financial depth. Adopting explicit deposit insurance to counteract instability in the financial sector does not appear to solve the problem. The typical reaction to that type of decision has been negative, at least with regard to financial depth in the three years after the program's inception. Adopting explicit deposit insurance when government credibility and institutional development were high appears to have had a positive effect on financial depth.

40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that banking supervision and resolution {{have to be}} organised at the same level. It is often argued, however, {{that there is no}} need to tackle deposit insurance because it is too politically sensitive. This note proposes to apply the principles of subsidiarity and re-insurance to deposit insurance: Existing national deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) would continue to operate much as before (with only minimal standards set by an EU directive), but they would be required to take out re-insurance against risks that would be too large to be covered by them. A European Reinsurance Fund (EReIF) would provide this reinsurance financed by premia paid by the national DGSs, just as any reinsurance company does in the private sector. The European Fund would pay out only in case of large losses. This ‘deductible’ would provide the national authorities with the proper incentives, but the reinsurance cover would stabilize <b>depositor</b> <b>confidence</b> even in the case of large shocks. Ideally the national DGSs would be responsible also for resolution. Experience has shown banking systems are more stable if deposit insurers are also responsible for resolution. The approach proposed here could thus be also used to design the ‘Single Resolution Mechanism’ (SRM) which is being discussed as a complement to the ‘Single Supervisory Mechanism’ (SSM). It will of course take time to build up the funding for such a reinsurance fund. This approach is thus not meant to deal with legacy problems from the current crisis...|$|E
40|$|Pushed by {{expanding}} income (on {{the back of}} rising oil prices) and by rapid external debt accumulation, the Kazakh banking sector featured {{one of the most}} dynamic credit booms in CESEE until 2007. Following the U. S. subprime crisis, banks’ access to external funding plummeted and credit expansion ground to zero. The global financial and economic crisis that broke out in late 2008 forced credit institutions to drive down their external debt. Moreover, the collapse of the oil price in late 2008 and the devaluation of the Kazakh tenge in February 2009 cut domestic demand, liquidity and solvency. The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) skyrocketed from 7 % at end- 2008 to 38 % a year later. Large losses stemming from real estate exposure (burst of the housing bubble), lending to dubious partners and fraud played a role. Loan loss provisions were sharply ramped up, profitability was all but wiped out in 2008 and hefty losses incurred in 2009 (ROA at end- 2009 : – 24 %). Sector capital even turned negative. The authorities’ crisis response measures included the nationalization of two of the country’s largest banks and the recapitalization of two others (together accounting for twothirds of banking sector assets). The two nationalized banks then defaulted on their high foreign liabilities and initiated debt restructuring negotiations that are currently in the process of completion, promising steep haircuts for creditors, which should reduce the sector’s debt burden and positively impact its capital. Very high credit risk and a weak institutional environment weigh on investor sentiment. But there are also important shock-absorbing factors: the (oil price-driven) recovery of the real economy, <b>depositor</b> <b>confidence,</b> record-level official foreign currency reserves, the record-level oil stabilization fund and modest public debt. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide banks, {{economic}} planners and policy makers with knowledge on individualâ€™s saving behaviour so as to assist them in framing appeals accordingly. To achieve this, the study sought to test the applicability of the life cycle hypothesis of saving to Zimbabwe. The life cycle hypothesis of saving is one of the well-known theories that seek to explain individualâ€™s saving behaviour. The study was motived by the lack of <b>depositor</b> <b>confidence</b> and the challenge of accretive transitory deposits coupled by stagnant long term deposits which have faced the country since the introduction of the Multiple Currency System (MCS) despite money supply being on an upward trend. A coalesced of the comparative and survey research design, where data was collected from a sample of 512 respondents drawn from the general public in Bulawayo and Gweru was found to be the most appropriate. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected using a combination of questionnaires, interviews and secondary data from the 2012 national census and Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey (PICES) 2011 / 12. This data was analysed using a combination of MS Excel, Stata 12, thematic and content analysis. The results of the study revealed that the major motive for saving during an individualâ€™s working years is for the purchase or construction of land and housing. Saving for life after retirement was the fourth most common motive for saving coming after the saving for childrenâ€™s education and the precautionary motive. Furthermore, the results found that the primary source of income during retirement was business, professional and farming profits. In line with the life cycle hypothesis, income followed a â€˜humpedâ€™ pattern peaking in middle age. However, income did not exceed consumption in the middle age contrary to the life cycle hypothesis. Moreover, the study revealed that age varies with asset holding in a â€˜waveâ€™ shaped pattern. Despite the actual results suggesting that the life cycle hypothesis is not applicable, the study found that if one goes by peopleâ€™s intentions and attitudes the life cycle hypothesis was applicable in Zimbabwe. Given that the life cycle hypothesis is not applicable in Zimbabwe, banks are therefore advised to frame appeals for the purchase or construction of land and housing for cohorts in the 25 - 44 year age group. Banks can frame appeals on retirement products to those approaching retirement as this motive only becomes dominant as people approach retirement. Lastly, the study recommends banks to raise awareness of â€˜pay yourself firstâ€™ in addition to educating people how to save for retirement...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{banks were}} leading {{participants}} in the U. S. securities markets during the great bull markets of the 19202 ̆ 7 s and the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Those stock market booms and the crashes that followed were extraordinary events. Is it merely a coincidence that the two most dramatic stock market booms and crashes in U. S. history occurred during periods when commercial banks played major roles in our securities markets? Or did the exercise of universal banking powers contribute to the financial and economic conditions that produced both episodes? This essay is the first installment of a larger project that seeks to answer these questions. This essay offers a preliminary assessment of {{the role played by}} universal banks in the economic boom-and-bust cycle of 1921 - 33. Part I reviews the reasons for Congress 2 ̆ 7 decision to prohibit universal banking in 1933. Senator Carter Glass and other proponents of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) maintained that banks and their securities affiliates encouraged speculative behavior and helped to promote unsustainable booms in the securities markets and the broader economy. Glass and his colleagues also contended that universal banking powers created conflicts of interest that prevented commercial banks from acting as impartial lenders or objective investment advisors. Part II examines the role of commercial banks during the economic boom of the 19202 ̆ 7 s. In response to a relaxation of legal rules governing bank powers, banks greatly expanded their financing of business firms and consumers through five channels - loans on securities, securities investments, public offerings of securities, real estate mortgages, and consumer credit. This surge of new financing enabled business firms and consumers to assume heavy debt burdens and to make risky investments that proved to be unviable when the U. S. economy entered a sharp recession in the summer of 1929. In addition, the entry of commercial banks into the securities markets created competitive pressures that caused commercial banks and traditional investment banks to abandon prudential standards and promote speculative domestic and foreign ventures. Commercial banks re-entered the securities markets during the 19902 ̆ 7 s as a result of court decisions and administrative rulings that opened loopholes in the GSA. In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which effectively repealed the GSA and authorized the creation of financial holding companies. GLBA reflected a widely-shared view among modern scholars that the 1933 legislation was misguided from the outset. However, due to the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 and the revelation of scandals involving universal banks (e. g., Enron and WorldCom), some commentators have begun to reconsider the benefits and risks of universal banking. Part III of the essay offers a preliminary response to the modern scholarly critique of the GSA. First, contrary to the claims of some scholars, Congress did not adopt the 1933 legislation for the purpose of protecting investment banks from competition with commercial banks. Instead, Congress separated commercial and investment banking in order to prevent speculative booms and to ensure that banks acted impartially in making loans and providing investment advice. Second, there was substantial evidence for Congress 2 ̆ 7 belief that universal banks posed serious risks to the banking system. Universal banks undermined the soundness of smaller correspondent banks by encouraging them to purchase speculative securities during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Losses on securities were a major cause of bank failures during the 19302 ̆ 7 s. In addition, several large universal banks failed between 1930 and 1933, due in part to risky investments and loans they made to support their own stock prices and to prop up affiliates. Those failures triggered regional banking panics and also contributed to the widespread loss of <b>depositor</b> <b>confidence</b> in the banking system. Third, modern scholars have attacked the conclusions reached by the Pecora investigation of 1933 - 34. However, earlier scholars concluded that the Pecora hearings produced credible evidence of conflicts of interest and other abuses involving universal banks during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Given recent episodes of similar misconduct by universal banks during the 19902 ̆ 7 s, {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the risks created by universal banks during both periods...|$|E
