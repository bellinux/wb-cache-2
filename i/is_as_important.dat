5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E

25|$|Although Kant {{considered}} {{these two}} interests of {{reason to be}} objective and universal, {{the distinction between the}} natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (an influence to Boas) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as human rationality. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured.|$|E

In the area of early relationships it has largely been superseded by attachment theory and other theories relating to even earlier infant–parent interactions. As a concept, parental deficiencies are seen as a vulnerability factor for, rather than a direct cause of, later difficulties.

[...] Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and [...] "not music". Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a [...] "very odd orchestra...only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range." [...] This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: [...] "Anthony's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow." [...] Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a [...] "modern day orchestra". The character Mason Verger had his own [...] "theme", which become more [...] "perverted" [...] as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score. [...] "Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans' full attention...the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience." [...] In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, Hannibal ranked at [...] 59.
