5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an.

In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in Manama, and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq. , there are a total of 126,981 students studying <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{after the}} Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew continued {{to be used as}} a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew, and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century, culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. <b>In</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} evolution <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b> Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

Why would homeschool parents in west Tennessee allow their child to participate or why would they not allow their child(ren) to participate <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> extracurricular activities if available? Why are homeschooled students involved in extracurricular activities? Purposeful sampling was used to interview a minimum of five homeschooling parents. Data triangulation was utilized in the analysis of the data collected through surveys and interviews. Both parents that allowed their children to participate in extracurricular activities (outside of the <b>public</b> <b>school</b> environment) and those that do not allow their children to participate in extracurricular activities were interested in the option of being able to allow their child to participate <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> extracurricular activities whether they chose to utilize or not...|$|R
