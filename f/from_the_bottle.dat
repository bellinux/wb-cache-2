5|$|Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on February 27, 1897, and officially {{abolished}} the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen {{to leave her}} palace at 1:30 in the morning. She was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily, swigging rum directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> in an uncustomarily coarse fashion. At Toamasina on March 6, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen's fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the illegitimate child of a French soldier.|$|E

Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E

25|$|According to Patricia Galloway, the Choctaw {{region of}} Mississippi, {{generally}} located between the Yazoo basin {{to the north}} and the Natchez bluffs to the south, was slowly occupied by Burial Urn people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bottle</b> Creek Indian Mounds area in the Mobile, Alabama delta, along with remnants of people from the Moundville chiefdom (near present-day Tuscaloosa, Alabama), which had collapsed some years before. Facing severe depopulation, they fled westward, where they combined with the Plaquemines and a group of “prairie people” living near the area. When this occurred is not clear. In the space of several generations, they created a new society which became known as Choctaw (albeit with a strong Mississippian background).|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of kelly pool, the {{numbered}} markers (commonly called [...] or pills, and sometimes tally balls or shake balls) are placed in a specially made, narrow-necked container (called variously a , pea bottle, pill bottle, kelly bottle, tally bottle or shake bottle) which is shaken to randomly distribute them. Each player then draws a numbered pea <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> The number of the pea drawn assigns to that player the correspondingly numbered , which that player must keep secret from his opponents.

He ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich and the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen—located outside the pocket—to attack Hill 262. At 09:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion's positions around the Zameczek to the north and northeast of point 262N were assaulted, and it was not until 10:30 that the Germans were driven back.

So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

2500|$|The words [...] "draft" [...] and [...] "draught" [...] {{have been}} used as {{marketing}} terms to describe canned or bottled beers, implying that they taste and appear like beers from a cask or keg.

Two examples are Miller Genuine Draft, a [...] pale lager which is produced using a cold filtering system, and Guinness stout in patented [...] "Draught-flow" [...] cans and bottles. Guinness is an example of beers that use a nitrogen widget to create a smooth beer with a very dense head. Guinness has recently replaced the widget system from their bottled [...] "draught" [...] beer with a coating of cellulose fibres {{on the inside of the}} bottle.

2500|$|At last, Hirst reenters, having slept, {{and struggles}} to {{remember}} a recent dream. Foster and Briggs have also started drinking, and they refill the older men's glasses. Hirst mentions an album of photographs he keeps, commenting on the appearances {{of the people in}} the album. He does not appear to fully remember Spooner's identity, insisting that his true friends are kept safely in the album. He begins drinking straight <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> mutters incoherent statements, and continues to ponder his dream—involving someone drowning—when Spooner abruptly says that he was the one drowning in Hirst's dream. Hirst drunkenly collapses and Spooner now rushes in to Hirst's aid, brushing away the two younger men and claiming to be Hirst's true friend. The younger pair becomes defensive and accusatory, asserting their obligation to protect Hirst against [...] "men of evil". Foster openly criticises his own past, as well as Hirst's impulsiveness and alcoholism. It gradually becomes apparent that Foster is Hirst's apprentice and housekeeper, and Briggs is Hirst's personal servant. All exit except for Spooner and Foster, the latter of whom says, [...] "Listen. You know what it's like when you're in a room with the light on and then suddenly the light goes out? I'll show you. It's like this". He flicks off the lights, causing a blackout.|$|E
2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E

On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke {{to let him go}} to Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa with a bottle of liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it. Lexa nearly kills Raven, but Bellamy figures out it was Gustus who poisoned the cup, and Clarke proves it to Lexa by drinking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> herself. Lexa kills Gustus. When Lincoln confronts Bellamy about how he knew it was Gustus, he says Gustus would do anything to protect Lexa. Clarke decides she sees Lexa's point about how love is a weakness and tells Bellamy he was right and should go to Mount Weather.|$|E
