5000|$|Funic souffle (funicular souffle, <b>foetal</b> <b>souffle)</b> is a sharp, {{whistling}} {{sound that}} is synchronous with {{the pulse of}} the foetus, usually heard during the second trimester of pregnancy (13-28 weeks). It is heard because of the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries of the foetus, and is therefore synchronous with the foetal pulse. The funic souffle is not heard consistently. On auscultation, funic souffle may often be confused with uterine souffle, which is a soft, blowing sound synchronous with the maternal pulse. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to differentiate uterine souffle from funic souffle.|$|E
