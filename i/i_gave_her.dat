She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away.

[...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

500|$|No further {{attempts}} to establish English colonies in the Americas were made {{until well into}} the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during the last decades of the 16th century. In the meantime the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared [...] "that this realm of England is an Empire". The subsequent Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies. [...] In 1562, the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the New World. At the same time, influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee (who was the first to use the term [...] "British Empire") were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China, and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area, later to become New France.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody's Fool", also by Lee, Moody, and Hodges, {{is about}} celebrities with false images. In a VH1 interview, Lee said: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't {{want to offend}} anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started {{dressing}} like them and she was like 8 years old. So <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the talk and I wrote a song." [...] "My Immortal", a piano rock ballad written by Moody with a bridge by Lee, {{is based on a}} short story Moody wrote; in the album booklet he dedicates the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. [...] "Haunted" [...] is also based on a Moody short story which was posted on the Evanescence fan forum, EvBoard.com. [...] "Tourniquet" [...] was originally written for Christian death metal band Soul Embraced, which included future Evanescence member Rocky Gray. [...] "Imaginary", a song from Evanescence's 1998 self-titled EP, was originally intended as Fallen fourth single. The midtempo [...] "Taking Over Mes lyrics are about Lee being consumed by another person's obsession with her. [...] "Hello" [...] remembers one of Lee's sisters, who died of an illness in 1987 at age three. The lyrics of [...] "My Last Breath" [...] explore emotional survival, with the lack of air a metaphor.

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece.

At approximately 15:30, Gary Amerigo, the local ice cream vendor, arrived and Palmer went to ask Thornton {{if she could}} have money to buy an ice pop. She was the only customer, and after serving her, the ice cream salesman left and continued his route. Amerigo said later: [...] "Only Rosie came up to my van that day.

The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world.

2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with.
