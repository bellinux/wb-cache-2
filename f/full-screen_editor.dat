5000|$|A <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor,</b> called O26 (after the IBM model 026 key punch, {{with the}} first {{character}} made alphabetic due to operating system restrictions), could be run on the operator console. This text editor appeared in 1967—which made {{is one of the}} first full-screen editors. (Unfortunately, it took CDC another 15 years to offer FSE, a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> for normal time-sharing users on CDCs Network Operating System.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} uses a single-pass compiler {{to generate}} byte code that is interpreted {{when the program}} is run. Since the memory is very limited on these early home computers, the compiler can compile to/from disk and memory. The software package for C64 includes a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> and command shell.|$|E
2500|$|... ed is a {{line editor}} for the Unix {{operating}} system. It {{was one of the}} first parts of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969.

50|$|Merlin {{included}} an integrated source code editor (initially a line editor; later versions included a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor)</b> {{and also a}} disassembler, called Sourceror. A related utility, Sourceror.FP, could generate a commented disassembly of the Apple II's Applesoft BASIC, the source code for which had never been released by Apple, from the customer's own ROM.|$|E

50|$|SYMPL is an {{obsolete}} {{programming language}} {{developed by the}} Control Data Corporation (CDC) for use on the CDC 6000 series computer systems in the 1970s and 1980s. It {{was based on a}} subset of CDCs version of JOVIAL, as an alternative to assembly language. A number of important CDC software products were implemented in SYMPL, including compilers, libraries, a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor,</b> and major subsystems.|$|E

5000|$|Microsoft {{acquired}} 86-DOS {{and sold}} it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1.0-v5.0 of MS-DOS, after which the only editor included was the new <b>full-screen</b> MS-DOS <b>Editor</b> in v6.0-v8.0.|$|R
5000|$|The {{replacement}} of Sinclair's editor {{meant that it}} was not possible to use the 128K Spectrum ROM's <b>full-screen</b> BASIC <b>editor.</b> No compiler was available for Beta BASIC code and existing Sinclair BASIC compilers such as HiSoft BASIC could not handle the extended keywords and facilities of Beta BASIC.|$|R
5000|$|EXOS (Enterprise Expandable Operating System) is {{contained}} in the system ROM, {{and is based on}} [...] "channels". All peripherals are accessed through channels, which allows the programs to treat all input and output devices identically. The system ROM also contains a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor,</b> which doubles as a simple word processor. It can edit text files and BASIC programs, as well as programs written in other languages. The editor uses the joystick for cursor control.|$|E
5000|$|A visual editor, or <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> is {{computer}} software for editing text files using a textual or {{graphical user interface}} which displays the content (text) in an easy {{to look at and}} good view; that is, it displays a portion of the opened file and updates it in [...] By definition, all visual editors require a re-fresh-able display device and all editors with a GUI are visual.

50|$|A cartridge-based {{development}} {{system for a}} readable ALGOL-like language that compiles to efficient 6502 code. Action! combines a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> with a compiler that generates code directly to memory without involving disk access. The language found a niche for being over a hundred times faster than Atari BASIC, but much easier to program in than assembly language. Compiled Action! programs require the cartridge to be present—because standard library functions are on the cartridge—unless the developer uses the Run Time Package (which was a separate purchase).|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} A/36 shipped with a {{very popular}} application called POP, or Programmer and Operator Productivity Aid. POP was so popular on the earlier S/36 that more copies were pirated than sold, according to industry publications. POP added a point-and-shoot interface for S/36 objects such as libraries and files, and a <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> that more closely resembled AS/400 SEU than System/36 SEU.|$|R
50|$|In computing, a {{line editor}} is a text editor {{in which each}} editing command applies {{to one or more}} {{complete}} lines of text designated by the user. Line editors predate screen-based text editors and originated in an era when a computer operator typically interacted with a teleprinter (essentially a printer with a keyboard), with no video display, and no ability to move a cursor interactively within a document. Line editors were also a feature of many home computers, avoiding the need for a more memory-intensive <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It was a quite {{advanced}} BASIC and {{featured a}} runtime threaded code compiler that compiled the program when one entered the [...] command. The dialect {{was very close}} to MSX BASIC. The major differences were the lack of the , , [...] and [...] operators, the inability to open several files at the same time, and the inability to use more than one operator on one line. Only the UKNC version had a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor.</b> Machine-dependent features, like graphics operators parameters and [...] addresses were also different.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{widespread}} Mallard application ever was RPED, the text editor supplied with the PCW. The name was short for Roland Perry's EDitor, the program being put together quickly by Roland Perry, the Amstrad executive running the computer product development, when it was realised that CP/M-80 came with no usable <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor,</b> but users had a requirement to edit configuration files. The same problem was apparent with DOS Plus and MS-DOS supplied with IBM-compatible Amstrad computers, but the RPED for those machines was written in 8086 assembler, and not Mallard BASIC.|$|E
5000|$|PyRoom is a full-screen writing program, i.e. a <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> {{with the}} purpose of {{isolating}} the user from the operating system and other applications. Written using the GTK+ widget toolkit, PyRoom is a clone of the WriteRoom text editor and features [...] "distraction-free writing". Because PyRoom takes up the whole screen, it is [...] "without buttons, widgets, formatting options, menus and with only the minimum of required dialog windows". It is keyboard oriented and can be configured.|$|R

50|$|NoteTab is a freeware/commercial, multi-file, <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> for MS Windows. It was {{developed}} by Eric Fookes of Fookes Software, Switzerland. The program's name refers {{to the fact that}} it was one of the earliest text-editors to use a Tabbed Document Interface. The first version, known as Mini NoteTab, was released in 1995; version 5 was released in 2006, version 5.7 in 2008, version 6 on May 4, 2009, ver 7.0 in Mar 2012, 7.1 in Oct 2012. Before version 5, the latest version of NoteTab Light was 4.95.|$|R
5000|$|Version 4, {{released}} in 1987, {{was a total}} rewrite, with both look and feel and internal operation much changed; versions 5 to 7 were incremental improvements and expansions. The compiler generated executables in [...]EXE format under DOS, rather than the simpler but more restricted [...]COM executables. The by-then-obsolete CP/M and CP/M-86 operating system versions were dropped when TP was rewritten. Version 4 introduced units, and a full-screen text user interface with pull-down menus; earlier versions had a text-based menu screen and a separate <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor.</b> (Microsoft Windows was still very experimental when the first version was released, and even mice were rare.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Line {{numbers were}} {{optional}} in Zgrass, and typically only appeared on lines {{that were the}} target of a [...] Most BASIC interpreters required line numbers for every line of code, but this was due to their use in the [...] "line editor" [...] - if you needed to edit that line, the only way to refer to it was by number. Zgrass used a more advanced <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> that eliminated this need. Zgrass allowed any string to act as a [...] "line number", [...] and [...] were both valid. Zgrass also included nameless branches, using the [...] instruction, which would move forward or back a given number of lines.|$|E
5000|$|When {{computer}} terminals {{with video}} screens became available, screen-based text editors (sometimes called just [...] "screen editors") became common. One {{of the earliest}} full-screen editors was O26, which was written for the operator console of the CDC 6000 series computers in 1967. Another early <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> was vi. Written in the 1970s, {{it is still a}} standard editor on Unix and Linux operating systems. Emacs, one of the first open source and free software projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ported to many systems. A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.|$|E
50|$|A cable and/or IrDA {{transceiver}} {{connecting the}} calculator {{to a computer}} make the process easier and expands other possibilities such as on-board spreadsheet, database, graphics, and word processing programs. The second option {{is being able to}} code the programs on board the calculator itself. This option is facilitated by the inclusion of <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editors</b> and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items. Some calculators have QWERTY keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close {{to the size of a}} regular 102-key computer keyboard. Programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers.|$|R
50|$|TECO was {{available}} for several operating systems and computers, including the PDP-1 computer, the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 mainframe, and TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 on the PDP-10.A version of TECO was provided with all DEC operating systems; the version available for RT11 was able to drive the GT40 graphics display while the version available for RSTS/E was implemented as a multi-user run-time system and {{could be used as}} the user's complete operating environment; the user never actually had to exit TECO. The VTEDIT (Video Terminal Editor) TECO macro was commonly used on RSTS/E and VAX systems with terminals capable of direct-cursor control (e.g. VT52 and VT100) to provide a <b>full-screen</b> visual <b>editor</b> similar in function to the contemporaneously developed Emacs.|$|R
50|$|Early {{products}} {{included several}} programs by Bilofsky, {{as well as}} his adaptations and extensions of Ron Cain’s Small C (“C/80”) and Tom Crosley’s <b>full-screen</b> Programma Improved <b>Editor</b> (“PIE”) whose design was in turn based on “ned”, the Rand Editor for UNIX, which Bilofsky designed and wrote at The Rand Corporation in 1974. Dave Kittinger contributed MYCHESS. James Gillogly wrote a RUNOFF-style text formatting program program called TEXT. The spreadsheet program ZENCALC was the first published software by Robert Wesson who went on to found Knowledge Engineering (the Zen and Perfect productivity series) {{and a number of other}} successful ventures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{convenient}} {{feature of}} Commodore's ROM-resident BASIC interpreter and KERNAL was the <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor.</b> Although Commodore keyboards only featured two cursor keys which alternated direction when the shift key was held, the screen editor allowed users to enter direct commands or to input and edit program lines from {{anywhere on the}} screen. If a line was prefixed with a line number, it was tokenized and stored in program memory. Lines not beginning with a number were executed by pressing the [...] key whenever the cursor happened {{to be on the}} line. This marked a significant upgrade in program entry interfaces compared to other common home computer BASICs at the time, which typically used line editors, invoked by a separate [...] command, or a [...] "copy cursor" [...] that truncated the line at the cursor's position.|$|E

DIAL provides a soft animation machine whose instruction set is determined by a user-provided backend. Unlike more recent animation notations that rely on bitmapped displays, and hence on special editors and extensive run-time support, DIAL requires only a conventional <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> for editing and no run-time support beyond its compact interpreter.

40|$|What tools {{do you use}} {{to develop}} and debug software? Most of us rely on a <b>full-screen</b> <b>editor</b> to write code, a {{compiler}} to translate it, a source-level debugger to correct it, and a source-code control system to archive and share it. These tools originated in the 1970 s, when the change from batch to interactive programming stimulated the development of innovative languages, tools, environments, and other utilities we take for granted. Three decades later, these are still the primary tools developers use to write software. Although they’ve been refined, the tools have neither progressed {{to meet the challenge}} of complex software nor evolved to exploit faster computers.

40|$|TEMPEST is a <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> that {{incorporates}} a structural paradigm {{in addition to}} the more traditional textual paradigm provided by most editors. While the textual paradigm treats the text as a sequence of characters, the structural paradigm treats it as a collection of named blocks which the user can define, group, and manipulate. Blocks can be defined to correspond to the structural features of he text, thereby providing more meaningful objects to operate on than characters of lines. The structural representation of the text is kept in the background, giving TEMPEST the appearance of a typical text editor. The structural and textual interfaces coexist equally, however, so one can always operate on the text from wither point of view. TEMPEST's representation scheme provides no semantic understanding of structure. This approach sacrifices depth, but affords a broad range of applicability and requires very little computational overhead. A prototype has been implemented to illustrate the feasibility and potential areas of application of the central ideas. It was developed and runs on an IBM Personal Computer...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 163 - 165) This {{thesis is}} the specification {{and design of}} a portable, <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> (PED). PED has sufficient text capibilities for the most experienced typist and the most particular programmer. The editor also has the flexibility to be installed for use on any terminal with control and escape keys. The editor capibilities include such features as moving text, copying text, deleting text and changing text [...] all {{with the use of}} cursor control and full-screen display. PED allows scanning a file by moving the window up, down, left, or right, and editing a file by typing changes directly onto the text as it appears in the window. The cursor is positioned by the use of the four ???cursor motion??? keys marked with arrows and by the return and tab keys. In addition, PED provides capabilities used by the experienced typist. Such capabilities include setting of left and right margins and setting and clearing tab stops. Consistent with an electronic typewriter interface, PED will have a displayable columnar ???editor ruler??? as a visual reference for performing these functions. PED is designed for portability. This portability is achieved by designing each task of the editor as a seperate module. It is also important that PED's least portable tasks be isolated as seperate modules. Once these dependent tasks have been isolated, their implementation becomes easier. This makes PED more portable, for use on other computers...|$|R
50|$|Cassette BASIC loads when a PC or PCjr is booted {{without a}} {{bootable}} disk or cartridge. Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC load when their command name (BASIC and BASICA respectively) is typed at a DOS command prompt (except PCjr, which activates Cartridge BASIC instead), with some optional parameters to control allocation of memory. When loaded, a sign-on identification message displays the program version number, and a <b>full-screen</b> text <b>editor</b> starts (see images, right). The function keys are assigned common commands, which {{display at the}} bottom of the screen. Commands may be typed in to load or save programs, and expressions can be typed in and executed in direct (immediate) mode. If a line of input starts with a number, the language system stores the following line of text as part of program source, allowing a programmer to enter in an entire program line by line, entering line numbers before each statement. When listed on screen, lines are displayed in order of increasing line number. Changes can be made to a displayed line of program source code by moving the cursor to the line with the cursor keys, and typing over the on-screen text. Program source is stored internally in a tokenized form, where keywords are replaced with a single byte token, to save space and execution time. Programs may be saved in compact tokenized form, or optionally saved as DOS text ASCII files that can be viewed and edited with other programs. Like most other DOS applications, IBM BASIC is a text-mode program and has no features for windows, icons, mouse support, or cut and paste editing.|$|R
