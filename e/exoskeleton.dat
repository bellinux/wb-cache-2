5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and <b>exoskeleton.</b> Transversal division occurs when polyps and the <b>exoskeleton</b> divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the <b>exoskeleton</b> that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the <b>exoskeleton</b> and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be {{fused together to form}} a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard <b>exoskeleton,</b> which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the <b>exoskeleton</b> may be fused together.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to provide an {{overview}} of assistive <b>exoskeletons</b> that have specifically been developed for industrial purposes and to assess the potential effect of these <b>exoskeletons</b> on reduction of physical loading on the body. The search resulted in 40 papers describing 26 different industrial <b>exoskeletons,</b> of which 19 were active (actuated) and 7 were passive (non-actuated). For 13 <b>exoskeletons,</b> the effect on physical loading has been evaluated, mainly in terms of muscle activity. All passive <b>exoskeletons</b> retrieved were aimed to support the low back. Ten-forty per cent reductions in back muscle activity during dynamic lifting and static holding have been reported. Both lower body, trunk and upper body regions could benefit from active <b>exoskeletons.</b> Muscle activity reductions up to 80 % have been reported as an effect of active <b>exoskeletons.</b> <b>Exoskeletons</b> have the potential to considerably reduce the underlying factors associated with work-related musculoskeletal injury. Practitioner Summary: Worldwide, a significant interest in industrial <b>exoskeletons</b> does exist, but a lack of specific safety standards and several technical issues hinder mainstay practical use of <b>exoskeletons</b> in industry. Specific issues include discomfort (for passive and active <b>exoskeletons),</b> weight of device, alignment with human anatomy and kinematics, and detection of human intention to enable smooth movement (for active <b>exoskeletons)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Some sponges also secrete <b>exoskeletons</b> {{that lie}} {{completely}} outside their organic components. For example, sclerosponges ("hard sponges") have massive calcium carbonate <b>exoskeletons</b> {{over which the}} organic matter forms a thin layer with choanocyte chambers in pits in the mineral. These <b>exoskeletons</b> are secreted by the pinacocytes that form the animals' skins.|$|R

5|$|Adephaga {{contains}} about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes ground beetles (Carabidae), water beetles (Dytiscidae) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae). In these insects, the testes are tubular {{and the first}} abdominal sternum (a plate of the <b>exoskeleton)</b> is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).|$|E

50|$|<b>Exoskeletons</b> are external, and {{are found}} in many invertebrates; they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body.

5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed <b>exoskeleton.</b> However, upon closer examination, their features differ significantly; most noticeably, {{they do not}} have the six-legged characteristic of adult insects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exoskeleton</b> is {{generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the <b>exoskeleton</b> of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall.

5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an <b>exoskeleton,</b> but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their <b>exoskeleton</b> and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, a {{significant}} interest in wearable robots or <b>exoskeletons</b> does exist, also from an industrial background. This paper {{provides an overview}} of assistive <b>exoskeletons</b> that have specifically been developed for industrial purposes. It discusses their potential in increasing performance and flexibility on one hand and in reducing the mechanical loads on workers involved in manual work on the other. From this it is concluded that <b>exoskeletons</b> have the potential to increase performance under specific conditions and to reduce physical loads significantly. However, several technical issues hinder mainstay practical use of <b>exoskeletons</b> in industry until now. One main issue concerns the human-machine interaction which stands in the way of acceptance. This issue and its linkage to ethics and standardization will be discussed during the conference.

5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand.

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust <b>exoskeleton</b> on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For over a century, technologists and {{scientists}} have actively sought {{the development of}} <b>exoskeletons</b> and orthoses designed to augment human economy, strength, and endurance. While {{there are still many}} challenges associated with exoskeletal and orthotic design that have yet to be perfected, the advances in the field have been truly impressive. In this commentary, I first classify <b>exoskeletons</b> and orthoses into devices that act in series and in parallel to a human limb, providing a few examples within each category. This classification is then followed by a discussion of major design challenges and future research directions critical to the field of <b>exoskeletons</b> and orthoses. </p...|$|R

5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard <b>exoskeleton</b> and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's <b>exoskeleton</b> {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin <b>exoskeleton,</b> are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its <b>exoskeleton,</b> which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
