40|$|Nipple {{discharge}} is {{a common}} presenting symptom of underlying breast pathology. This study examined the impact of <b>galactography</b> on the evaluation of abnormal nipple discharge. Thirty-five women with spontaneous, unilateral nipple discharge who underwent <b>galactography</b> from 1995 to 1997 were retrospectively studied. Their presenting signs as well as mammographic, galactographic, and pathology findings were evaluated. Nipple discharge was bloody (n = 24), clear (n = 7), or serous (n = 4). A palpable mass was found in 5 patients, and discharge was spontaneous in 29 patients (83 %). Mammography was normal in 25 patients (71 %). Thirty patients (86 %) had an abnormal ductogram that was characterized as a filling defect (n = 20), cutoff sign (n = 5), or ductal dilatation (n = 5). The ductogram demonstrated the location and depth of the lesion in 29 patients (97 %). Excision was performed in 27 of 30 patients with an abnormal ductogram: 14 received complete subareolar duct excisions; 12, focused excisions; and 1, excision with a vacuum-assisted biopsy device. Pathology included intraductal papilloma (n = 20) and ductal ectasia (n = 7). Follow-up was completed in 24 patients, including 2 postoperative patients who had persistent discharge on manipulation. In conclusion, <b>galactography</b> is accurate in identifying {{the location of the}} ductal abnormality. It allows a focused surgical approach to the pathologic lesion in these patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} the diagnostic reliability of selective microdochectomy after direct ductoscopic wire marking of suspect lesions {{in patients with}} pathological nipple discharge. Methods Selective microdochectomy due to pathological discharge was performed in 33 patients with mean age of 51. 7 years. Ductoscopes of 0. 9 and 1. 1 mm in diameter with a channel for wire marking were used. Only patients without sonographic or mammographic correlation for the discharge were included. The pathologic mammary duct was wire marked and extirpated under direct visual guidance via the ductoscope. The histological results were compared with cytology, <b>galactography</b> and ductoscopy. Results In 24 out of 33 cases (72 %) an intraductal, epithelial proliferation was found histologically. The following sensitivities for intraductal, epithelial proliferations could be determined: cytology 4 %, <b>galactography</b> 74 %, and ductoscopy 78 %. Conclusion The method allows selective microdochectomy of the pathological duct and the intraductal proliferation under visual guidance.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the adjunctive diagnostic value of breast ultrasonography (US) in the study of benign ductal breast disease. Materials and methods. Fifty-two patients underwent US examinations for bloody nipple discharge, palpable retroareolar masses, retroareolar opacities or ductal pattern on mammography. US enabled visualisation of mammary-duct ectasia (simple or pseudocystic, retroareolar and/or peripheral) and focal masses (endoluminal or periductal, with ill-defined or regular margins). All patients with nipple discharge underwent cytological evaluation. After the US examination, all focal masses with ill-defined margins underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), if necessary. The benign alterations were followed up. Results. In 38 / 52 cases, US diagnosed mammary-duct ectasia and in 30 / 52 cases, the presence of focal masses (mean size 7 mm). In the nine women who underwent biopsy, histopathological evaluation diagnosed five solitary papillomas, one solitary papilloma with a focal area of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), two multiple papillomas of the nipple and one papillomatosis. Conclusions. High-frequency US plays an important role in the detection of benign ductal disease both for the diagnosis and classification of focal masses and mammary-duct ectasia. US can be used as a complementary imaging method to <b>galactography</b> or as a valuable alternative when <b>galactography</b> is not available...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with unilateral nipple discharge. Forty-four patients with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge and negative mammographic findings (35 / 44 cases) underwent MRI for evaluation of breast ducts. Ultrasonography, negative in 18 patients, identified 26 cases of ductal ectasia (12 simple, nine with solid intraductal echoes and wall thickening, five with inhomogeneous parenchyma). <b>Galactography</b> was negative in three patients and positive in nine. Nineteen patients were followed up by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and cytological evaluation of nipple discharge (6 - 12 months); three patients underwent excisional biopsy, ten core biopsy and 12 cytological biopsy (followed by excisional biopsy). MRI identified 25 enhancing lesions Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 3 or 4) and confirmed the galactographic findings (ductal ectasia, intraluminal filling defects). Five papillomatoses appeared as patchy, homogeneous enhancing areas, 15 intraductal papillomas as areas with well-defined margins and type II time-intensity curves, and two atypical ductal hyperplasias as diffuse nodular enhancement. One micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), one papillary carcinoma and one infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) were visualised as two segmental areas of enhancement and one mass-like enhancement with poorly defined margins (BI-RADS 4). The follow-up was negative, showing no pathological enhancement (BI-RADS 1) in 12 patients and benign enhancement (BI-RADS 2) in seven.

40|$|International audienceNipple {{discharge}} (ND) is {{a common}} symptom seen in breast cancer clinics. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to identify preoperative risk factors for breast cancer in patients with pathologic ND. The secondary aim was to assess the clinical and pathological effectiveness of physical examination, <b>galactography,</b> cytological examination of the discharge, selective duct excision and ductoscopy. All patients operated on between 1975 and 2008 who presented with ND as their only symptom was analyzed. Discharge's characteristics, cytological data and <b>galactography</b> reports were recorded. The relationship between each individual finding and the risk of breast cancer was calculated. For each diagnostic tool, the sensitivity, specificity and complication rates were calculated and compared. Nine-hundred-fifteen patients underwent selective duct excision. Two-hundred-nineteen patients (23. 9 %) were found to be affected by carcinoma. In 100 / 330 (30. 3 %) patients with bloody discharge and in 42 / 239 (17. 6 %) patients with serous secretion cancer was detected ( =  0. 004,  =  0. 013, respectively). Patients with sero-sanguinous or coloured discharge had the same risk of cancer as the population analyzed (23. 9 %,  = NS). Galactographic finding of irregular stenosis seemed to be associated with a higher risk of cancer ( =  0. 0001). Cytological findings C 5 and C 4 were associated with cancer ( =  0. 001). Selective duct excision showed highest sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, the well established role of bloody secretion is confirmed. The supposed benign aetiology of serous, coloured or sero-sanguinous discharge is questionable. The high specificity of the cytological exam justifies routine examination of the ND. Selective duct excision can be considered as the diagnostic gold-standard...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNipple {{discharge}} is {{a common}} symptom in breast medicine. It is usually benign in origin (papillomas and galactophore duct ectasia) although it is essential not to miss the risk of an underlying malignant lesion (5 %) mostly due to in situ carcinomas. Clinical examination is essential in the management, distinguishing benign “physiological” discharge from discharge suspected of being “pathological” in which further investigations with mammography and ultrasound are required. When the conventional imaging assessment for pathological nipple discharge is normal, breast MRI is gradually replacing <b>galactography</b> although this is still an emerging and invalidated indication. In this context and if the whole imaging assessment is normal, surgery {{is no longer the}} only solution for patients, who can now be offered regular monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} cases, breast {{carcinoma}} is {{the primary}} tumor of the female population. Having in mind a well known fact that {{the best and most}} effective way for its terminal eradication is an early treatment upon its localization, tremendous efforts are being made to make an early diagnosis of breast cancer. The sooner the better. The early and precise diagnosis is of crucial importance in the application of adequate therapy, thus achieving more successful outcome with the possibility of complete healing. It is established {{on the basis of a}} routine clinical examination and supplementary diagnostic methods. Supplementary diagnostic methods may be noninvasive, minimally invasive and invasive. Noninvasive diagnostic methods are: mammography, xeromammography, ultrasound, thermography, <b>galactography,</b> pneumocystography, computerized mammography, translumination scintigraphy, magnetic resonance and tomography with positive emission. Minimally invasive diagnostic methods are: ductal lavage, aspiration cytology performed with a thin needle and “tru-cut” biopsy. Invasive methods include: biopsy “ex tempore” and “sentinel lymph node” biopsy. Great importance is attributed to the preoperative diagnosis with the help of which we are able to establish the precise and timely diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} breast MRI in analysis of papillomas of the breast. Materials and Methods: From 1996 to 2004, 94 patients underwent surgery due to papillomas of the breast. Among them, 21 patients underwent 3 D fast low angle shot (FLASH) dynamic breast MRI. Eight masses were palpable and 11 of 21 patients had nipple discharge. Two radiologists indifferently analyzed the location, size of the lesions and shape, margin of the masses, multiplicity and ductal relation. The MRI findings were categorized according to breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) lexicon. The amount and pattern of enhancement and associated findings were also evaluated according to BI-RADS. We then compared the MRI findings with <b>galactography,</b> mammography and breast ultrasonography (US) and examined histopathologic correlation. Results: On breast MRI, the lesion size was 0. 4 - 1. 59 cm, and 18 patients showed subareolar location. On 4. 25 cm (mean 1. 54) dynamic enhanced images, imaging findings showed mass (n = 10), intracystic mass (n = 3), focus (n = 5), ductal enhancement (n = 2), and segmental enhancement (n = 1).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the value of galactography-guided, stereotactic, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) for the assessment of intraductal breast lesions and its potential as a therapeutic tool that could eliminate the need for surgical excision. Eighteen patients (median age 64 years, range 37 - 80) with nipple discharge and galactography-verified intraductal lesions underwent galactography-guided, stereotactic, 11 -gauge VABB followed by surgery. Histopathology findings from VABB and subsequent surgery were compared. Underestimation and false-negative rates were assessed. After VABB, histopathology revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in three (17 %), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in six (33 %), high-risk lesions in six (33 %) and benign lesions in three (17 %) cases. After surgical biopsy, histopathology confirmed the previously established diagnosis in 11 lesions (61 %). The underestimation rate for high-risk lesions and DCIS was 50 % (6 / 12). The false-negative rate was 7 % (1 / 14). Histopathology examination after surgery showed that not a single lesion had been completely removed at VABB. Galactography-guided VABB is a feasible diagnostic tool. However, its value as a therapeutic procedure is limited because of the high number of underestimated and missed lesions and because of the histopathological detection of lesions' remnants in every case. Surgical excision should be the therapeutic gold standard in cases of pathological nipple discharge and <b>galactography</b> abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Nipple discharge, the {{spontaneous}} release of fluid from the nipple, {{is a common}} presenting finding that {{may be caused by}} an underlying intraductal or juxtaductal pathology, hormonal imbalance, or a physiologic event. Spontaneous nipple discharge must be regarded as abnormal, although the cause is usually benign in most cases. Clinical evaluation based on careful history taking and physical examination, and observation of the macroscopic appearance of the discharge can help to determine if the discharge is physiologic or pathologic. Pathologic discharge can frequently be uni-orificial, localized to a single duct and to a unilateral breast. Careful assessment of the discharge is mandatory, including testing for occult blood and cytologic study for malignant cells. If the discharge is physiologic, reassurance of its benign nature should be given. When a pathologic discharge is suspected, the main goal is to exclude the possibility of carcinoma, which accounts for only a small proportion of cases with nipple discharge. If the woman has unilateral nipple discharge, ultrasound and mammography are frequently the first investigative steps. Cytology of the discharge is routine. Ultrasound is particularly useful for localizing the dilated duct, the possible intraductal or juxtaductal pathology, and for guidance of aspiration, biopsy, or preoperative wire localization. <b>Galactography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging can be selectively used in patients with problematic ultrasound and mammography results. Whenever there is an imaging-detected nodule or focal pathology in the duct or breast stroma, needle aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy should be performed for diagnosis. An excisional biopsy should be carried out with a thorough plan after a complete imaging evaluation. The evaluation of physiologic discharge or galactorrhea is primarily an assessment of endocrine factors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Intraductal {{disease of}} the breast is still {{difficult}} to diagnose. In most cases it is not evident on the radiological workup and therefore complicates adequate surgical therapy. Fiberoptic ductoscopy is increasingly used as an innovative method for direct endoscopic investigation of intraductal disease. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate its feasibility and clinical application in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer and in patients with pathologic nipple discharge in comparison with the standard radiological workup. Methods: From 2002 to 2005 ductoscopy was performed in 58 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of breast cancer and in 44 patients with pathologic nipple discharge. A rigid gradient index microendoscope (ø 0, 7 mm) was used for all examinations in combination with a special developed needle for intraductal vacuum assisted biopsy. Ductoscopy findings as well as histological results of intraductal biopsy were documented prospectively and were correlated to the preoperative radiological data and histopathology of the resection specimen. Results: Cannulation was successful in 91 % of patients with breast cancer. In these patients ductoscopy identified intraductal lesions in 46 % presenting as red patches,microcalcifications or ductal obstruction. Compared to patients with a normal ductoscopy,patients with a pathologic ductoscopy had a significant higher risk of extensive intraductal component (76 % vs. 18 %, p 0. 05), MRI in 35 % of the patients (p 0. 05). Patients with pathologic nipple discharge were cannulated successfully in 93 %. Intraductal proliferatives presenting as papillary lesions or ductal obstructions were visualized in 80 % of the patients. The diagnostic sensitivity of ductoscopy and <b>galactography</b> was comparable (93 % vs. 86 %, p> 0. 05). Intraductal vacuum assisted biopsy was successful in 97 % of the patients and yielded diagnostic material in 94 % of the patients. Histology of the resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis in all cases (22 papilloma, 2 in situ carcinoma, 2 invasive ductal carcinoma). In one patient histopathology of the resection specimen revealed additionally lobular carcinoma in situ not shown by ductoscopy. Conclusion: In the preoparative diagnosis of intraductal lesions ductoscopy is easy to perform in the clinical routine and presents a useful supplement for the standard radiological workup especially in patients with extensive intraductal disease. Intraductal vacuum assisted biopsy is an innovative technique which is able to provide fast histological diagnosis in many patients and therefore can improve the preoperative evaluation of patients with pathologic nipple discharge...|$|E
