40|$|In March, 1988, {{the first}} PUREX cycle {{suffered}} uranium {{contamination of the}} solvent, 30 % TBP in n-paraffin. Initial indication of maloperation was uranium contamination of the plutonium product stream, 1 BP. Uranium in relatively large quantities, 10 {sup {minus} 3 } to 10 {sup {minus} 4 } g/L, {{was found in the}} solvent in Tank 14. 7. This tank contains first cycle solvent that has been through the solvent washing system and is destined for return back to the cycle. Solvent, contained in Tank 14. 7 under normal operating conditions, has < 1 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } g U/L following the carbonate-acid-carbonate washing sequence. Work at SRL showed that the interfacial tension of the contaminated solvent, as sampled, was 2. 5, indicating that substances, possibly long chain acids, were present that could affect <b>disengaging</b> <b>times</b> for the solvent. Virgin 30 % TBP in n-paraffin has a interfacial tension of around 10 or better, for example. Tests conducted by Reif also showed that the contaminated solvent picked up significantly more fission products, Ru{sup 106 } and Zr{sup 95 }, than did virgin solvent. The contaminated solvent, following contact with alumina, had a greatly improved interfacial tension of 9. 5 and exhibited much less pickup of both Ru{sup 106 } and Zr{sup 95 }. In a H-Area process testing, contact of process solvent with alumina produced improved interfacial tension values and reduced Zr{sup 95 } pickup by the 7. 5 % TBP used there. From these tests, it is concluded that the contaminated solvent resulted from inefficient washing in the solvent washing system for first PUREX cycle. Nominal solvent chemistry should result if the solvent is properly washed in the carbonate-acid-carbonate process cycle. However, attention and study should be given to this solvent system because of the decline of its interfacial tension values. Such deterioration in solvent quality could be a portent of problems to come. Treatment with alumina, as was done with H-Area solvent, may become necessary...|$|R

This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain engaging and <b>disengaging</b> in <b>time.</b> But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain’s dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{beam welding}} bears evident {{advantages}} regarding precision, quality, productivity, low heat input, and feasibility of automation. At {{the same time}} the process calls for high precision of the beam positioning on the workpiece, which therefore imposes high requirements of welding trajectory and feed rate accuracy; e. g., for butt welding {{the focal point of the}} laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained within a typical accuracy better than 20 - 150 mu m, depending on the focused beam radius. To meet these requirements, seam-tracking devices are used. A sensor measures the joint position and computes a correction vector to compensate the joint trajectory offset. The deviation is compensated either by a robot trajectory adjustment or by an additional tracking axis. This paper describes the basic concepts of seam tracking in detail and points out problems in the different control principles, which are evoked by the forerun of the sensor. State-of-the-art sensors and error compensating techniques are presented and analyzed. Further, a new approach for seam tracking is introduced. It uses a multisensor concept, which in addition to the seam position measures the relative displacement between the processing head and the workpiece. An integrated two-dimensional beam positioning system enables "self-guided" processing, which allows high-accuracy tracking of a joint independent of the motion system and <b>disengages</b> from <b>time</b> intensive sensor calibration and robot teaching necessity...|$|R

The hastily formed squadrons rode forth, but the flat terrain of the Marchfeld provided them with little cover from the devastating fire unleashed upon them by Austrian artillery. The heavy horsemen eventually made contact with the enemy near the village of Süssenbrunn, but found the infantry prepared to receive them and their first charge failed altogether. Rallying the men for a second attempt, with the elite carabiniers-à-cheval leading the way, Nansouty pushed through, but many of his troopers were unable to follow, leaving many of the squadrons reduced to just a handful of men. It seemed at first that the charge would do some serious damage, especially when the Frenchmen managed to break and sabre the Grenz Georger battalion, thus creating a breach between the two Austrian Corps. In the end however, the effects of a cavalry charge against prepared infantry were always set to be limited and the cavalrymen made little further impression on the grenadier battalions, which were by now formed in tight, solid squares. Displaying some great tactical skill, Nansouty wheeled right with his men and fell upon the Austrian artillery line near Aderklaa. Meanwhile, Bessières was busy fetching the Guard cavalry, which was only just beginning to arrive and with which he was intending to launch a second charge. Virtually under Napoleon's eyes, a cannonball brushed Bessières's thigh, unhorsing the Marshal, who violently hit the ground and lost consciousness. While Bessières was being carried away from the battlefield, Nansouty and his [...] Carabiniers-à-Cheval managed to capture an Austrian artillery battery but Liechtenstein duly sent his fresh cavalry, the 6th Rosenberg Chevaulegers and 4th Kronprinz Ferdinand Cuirassiers against them. The Austrians hit the now diminished and tired French cavalry in flank, wounding Defrance and sending his men reeling back to their own lines with heavy casualties. The light cavalry of the Guard, some 2,000 sabres, belatedly launched a brief charge of their own, but they were also repulsed by the prepared enemy. With Bessières presumed dead, Nansouty took command of the entire cavalry, but, not knowing the Emperor's directives, decided to pull his battered troop back. In all, the French cavalry charge had been very costly; for the entire day, Nansouty's division alone lost 1,200 horses killed or wounded and a great number of men out of action.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young people (aged 16 - 24 years) with {{long-term}} health conditions can disengage from health services, resulting in poor health outcomes, but clinicians in the UK National Health Service (NHS) are using digital communication {{to try to}} improve engagement. Evidence of effectiveness of this digital communication is equivocal. There are gaps in evidence as to how it might work, its cost, and ethical and safety issues. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was {{to understand how the}} use of digital communication between young people {{with long-term}} conditions and their NHS specialist clinicians changes engagement of the young people with their health care; and to identify costs and necessary safeguards. METHODS: We conducted mixed-methods case studies of 20 NHS specialist clinical teams from across England and Wales and their practice providing care for 13 different long-term physical or mental health conditions. We observed 79 clinical team members and interviewed 165 young people aged 16 - 24 years with a long-term health condition recruited via case study clinical teams, 173 clinical team members, and 16 information governance specialists from study NHS Trusts. We conducted a thematic analysis of how digital communication works, and analyzed ethics, safety and governance, and annual direct costs. RESULTS: Young people and their clinical teams variously used mobile phone calls, text messages, email, and voice over Internet protocol. Length of clinician use of digital communication varied from 1 to 13 years in 17 case studies, and was being considered in 3. Digital communication enables timely access for young people to the right clinician at the time when it can make a difference to how they manage their health condition. This is valued as an addition to traditional clinic appointments and can engage those otherwise <b>disengaged,</b> particularly at <b>times</b> of change for young people. It can enhance patient autonomy, empowerment and activation. It challenges the nature and boundaries of therapeutic relationships but can improve trust. The clinical teams studied had not themselves formally evaluated the impact of their intervention. Staff time is the main cost driver, but offsetting savings are likely elsewhere in the health service. Risks include increased dependence on clinicians, inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, and communication failures, which are mostly mitigated by young people and clinicians using common-sense approaches. CONCLUSIONS: As NHS policy prompts more widespread use of digital communication to improve the health care experience, our findings suggest that benefit is most likely, and harms are mitigated, when digital communication is used with patients who already have a relationship of trust with the clinical team, and where there is identifiable need for patients to have flexible access, such as when transitioning between services, treatments, or lived context. Clinical teams need a proactive approach to ethics, governance, and patient safety...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. This {{research}} was undertaken because I, the practitioner researcher being {{the head of}} the Glenview Adult Education Centre in the Ekurhuleni West district – Gauteng, was concerned about the high failure and low pass rate of adult learners during the Senior Certificate examinations. This study aimed to explore in detail the main reasons for their failure and identify lessons that they offer for other adult learners. This study also focused on the reasons for the low levels of successes of the ABET (Adult Basic Education and Training) and how the centre can be viewed from a Freirean perspective. The ultimate aim of adult education is to produce citizens with critical thinking skills and it is with this breath that this study invites all stakeholders to work together to improve the current unacceptable failure rate of adults {{at the end of the}} Senior Certificate Examinations. Paulo Freire`s ideas are invoked as to provide possible solutions and not as a “quick fix” to the problem, to improve the current theoretical framework for thinking about results. His pedagogy is epoch making: he is a legend in his own time. Paulo Freire, educator, philosopher and political activator, has the capacity to excite and frustrate friends and critics alike. A genius like Freire (Taylor, 1993 : 73 - 74) was to bring together a range of pedagogies and learning teaching techniques to create a method of teaching which is known throughout the world as the “Mètodo Paulo Freire”, a method which is both a process of literacy acquisition and a process of conscientization, or conscientizacao (a word that he popularized and later dropped). It is based on the simple but fundamental technique of “problem posing” and there is therefore the antithesis of “Banking” Education, which seeks solutions or gives answers. It consists of daring to interrogate what is given, bringing into question known structures, and examining conventional or taken for granted explanations of reality. It discovers and then reacts to possible contradictions, identifying ways in which it can be said, done, or exists differently. However, despite, the urgent need for adult education to respond to the dictates of the needs of the community, development in education, effectiveness and quality at this Centre do not seem to be functioning as expected mainly because the learners are disengaged during the learning process. The stakeholders are further challenged to change their perceptions about adult education and its meaningful purpose to ensure a better life for adult learners. This route invites a healthy partnership whereby the concerns of the students and the community in line with the expectations of particularly the economy of South Africa as part of the global economy will form the backbone of such an understanding. Freires` pedagogy are used to reinforce my argument that better education should result in an improved contribution to economic growth, which in turn, should result in an improvement in the socio – economic growth of the previously oppressed adult learners. To obtain this objective at our Center, with very limited resources, it invites all stakeholders to unite to improve life for those who wish to obtain a Senior Certificate through part time studies. The study concludes with a few findings and recommendations, inter alia, that the adult learners are <b>disengaged</b> because of <b>time</b> constraints, different levels of prior learning, pressure of multiple responsibilities and a compact Senior Certificate programme. Recommendations are given that can possibly improve future practices and ultimately the success rate for adults in the Senior Certificate programme...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation (Ed. D., Educational Leadership) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between middle/high school students??? racial identity, religious participation, and perception of stereotype threat and the effect on student educational outcomes (student engagement, student achievement, academic identification, withdrawal, and dropout). The focus of this study was on African American students who participate in church-related religious activity on a regular basis. The Black community church has long provided the vehicle for the open expression of African American social, political, and educational discourse and organization needed to enact critically needed community change efforts. Environment assets such as the community Black church involvement for African American students may prove to hold resources for overcoming the achievement gap. When African Americans as a church community taught students who were denied access to public schools, the curriculum was culturally relevant and the teachers shared the same values, beliefs, traditions, and custom as the students they taught (hooks, 1992). This contributed to students??? feeling of belonging and identity and provided critical social capital, which is significant for African American student learning and development as a marginalized ethnic group. The literature reviewed for this study provides a discussion of four themes. The first theme examines the theoretical frames informing this study. These include: racial identity theory, critical race theory, stereotype threat theory, community cultural wealth, and critical social capital. The second theme provides a clear cultural context for the understanding and interpretation of the social and political climate of the study. This theme reviews the concept of race, racial socialization, and institutional racism as a pretense of the sociopolitical institutions and agencies in society, particularly education. The third theme explores the importance of youth development and community-based organizations in building self-esteem, racial identity development, and ethnic efficacy of adolescents. This includes the significance of the Black church community for African Americans politically, socially, and spiritually in racial identity development and ethnic pride. The fourth theme reviews the educational implications and outcomes these social and cultural factors have for African American middle/high school students attending American public schools. The research design was mixed-method, quantitative and qualitative. Data was collected from a 36 -question self-reported survey, focus group activity, and adult interviews, which were transcribed and analyzed for patterns and themes. The researcher utilized the linkages among the various data sources through coding, categories, and concepts to identify relevant findings related to the research questions. The researcher then triangulated the various data sources to build an understanding of student subjects??? experience of their world and the implication for educational outcomes. The findings indicated there were both statistically significant (p=. 05 or less) and statistically suggestive (p=. 10 or less) correlations between racial identity, religious participation, and stereotype threat and the impact on education outcomes such as grade point average, academic identity, academic engagement, social acceptance, future aspirations, as well as self-handicapping and academic disengagement. Students who experience stereotype threat without the buffer of resilience-making support, are more likely to participate in self handicapping and <b>disengaging</b> behavior over <b>time.</b> Steele (1994) suggested that these are the very students who eventually withdraw and/or drop out of school. The cost to the nation and states for students failing to complete high school is measured in billions of dollars. In addition, for students who drop out of school, the cost in human potential is priceless. The concluding chapter discusses the implications of the study including implications for transformational leadership, policy implications, and suggests future research studies with the final reflection of the researcher. It is imperative that researchers, educators, and policymakers explore the influencing factors and cultural assets of African Americans in their efforts to close the achievement gap, a persistent phenomenon that continues to undermine the national security and economic stability of the United States. The cost to the nation for students who do not complete high school or are unable to function and contribute as citizens is catastrophic. This study attempts to provide some possibilities for further knowledge and understanding research and reform efforts. Educational Leadershi...|$|R
