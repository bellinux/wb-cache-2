In this Phase II study, ALSTOM Power Inc.

Burning fossil fuels in mixtures of oxygen and recirculated flue gas (made principally of CO{sub 2 }) essentially eliminates the presence of atmospheric nitrogen in the flue gas. The resulting flue gas is comprised primarily of CO{sub 2 }, along with some moisture, nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases like SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. Oxygen firing in utility scale Pulverized Coal (PC) fired boilers {{has been shown to be}} a more economical method for CO{sub 2 } capture than amine scrubbing (Bozzuto, et al., 2001). Additionally, oxygen firing in Circulating Fluid Bed Boilers (CFB's) can be more economical than in PC or Stoker firing, because recirculated gas flow can be reduced significantly. Oxygen-fired PC and Stoker units require large quantities of recirculated flue gas to maintain acceptable furnace temperatures. Oxygen-fired CFB units, on the other hand, can accomplish this by additional cooling of recirculated solids.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{absorption}} rates of NO 2, SO 2 and a mixture of these two acid gases into urea solution in packed bed column. The absorption rate was studied {{as a function of}} absorbent temperature, urea concentration and acid gas concentration. The influence of liquid temperature between 10 - 40 ?C, urea concentration between 0. 1 - 0. 5 M and acid gas concentration NO 2 between 100 - 1000 ppm (191 - 1910 mg/m 3), SO 2 between 500 - 2500 ppm (1310 - 6530 mg/m 3) were investigated. The mass gas flow rate of 20. 646 (kg/m 2. min) at 25 ?C and the absorption rate were determined by measuring the NO 2 and SO 2 concentrations in the inlet and outlet streams of the absorptioncolumn. The absorption rate of SO 2 increases with the decrease of temperature of absorbent (urea solution) and with the increase of the urea concentration. The presence of NO 2 in the <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> lowers the absorption rate of SO 2 in urea solution due to the fast reaction of NO 2 with urea as compared with SO 2. The absorption rate of NO 2 decreases as the urea concentration exceeds 0. 4 mol/l and for NO 2 gas concentration of 100 ppm due to the decrease the diffusivity of the gas.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of superphosphate by the acidulation of phosphate rock with sulphuric acid, fluorine is evolved, mainly as silicon tetrafluoride, along with carbon dioxide and steam. This environmentally unacceptable fluoride is required to be removed before being vented to the atmosphere. This is usually done by absorbing the gas in water. However, industrially the absorption {{is complicated by the}} presence of entrained phosphate rock dust, mist particles and condensing steam in the gas stream, and by the silica formed from the reaction between silicon tetrafluoride and water. The absorption of dry silicon tetrafluoride in water under laboratory conditions is reasonably well understood. However, information on the absorption under industrial conditions is lacking. In all industrial measurements of the mass transfer coefficient the liquid-gas interfacial area is not known accurately and hence what is usually obtained is a coefficient per unit volume of the absorption equipment. This value is of limited use in exploring the effect of particulates and surface reaction as it is a complex average for different drop sizes and scrubber volumes and the chemical composition of the gas stream. Gas absorption, particulate collection and surface reaction need to be considered separately in comparing industrial scrubbers. Therefore {{in order to be able}} to translate the performance of a given scrubber from one works to another, the measurement of the mass transfer coefficient for one standard geometry in industrial conditions is needed. Thus the aim of this work is to establish a method of providing this information. By using a spinning cup sampling apparatus we were not only able to establish a method of determining a mass transfer coefficient for the absorption of the industrial <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> fluorides, but were also able to establish a method for determining the size of the particulate fluorides present in the gas stream. The main points arising from this work include: (1) The absorption is "gas" phase controlled (under normal conditions surface silica is unimportant) and the particulate fluorides in the gas stream will often be the controlling factor in scrubber performance. Thus the collection of particulate fluorides must be a primary concern in scrubber design, and high liquid to gas ratios in some section of a scrubber will promote this collection. (2) The particulate fluorides are small, of the order of 2 micrometers in diameter. (3) In the spinning cup apparatus used in this study, the mass transfer coefficient for a "gas" stream containing 25 % particulate fluorides at 90 to 100 °C is approximately 55 m h-¹...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Unsaturated surface {{deposits}} {{have been}} detected by in situ UV-vis spectroscopy on tetragonal [1] and mesoporous sulfated zirconia (tSZ and mpSZ) during n-butane and n-pentane isomerization. The different bulk structures of the two materials appear {{to lead to a}} different deactivation behavior. In order to further identify the nature of these deposits on tSZ and mpSZ and to identify a procedure for catalyst regeneration, the deactivated materials were reacted at 298 K first with oxygen and then with water vapor. Changes to the catalyst and the deposits during the treatment with both reagents were monitored (in situ) by DR UV-vis spectroscopy, and the effluent stream was analyzed by MS. Experimental tSZ was obtained by calcination of a commercial precursor (MEL Chemicals) at 823 K, mpSZ was synthesized as reported in the literature [2, 3]. For in situ spectroscopy, a fixed bed flow reactor was placed in the sample position at the integrating sphere of a Lambda 9 spectrometer (PerkinElmer). Spectra were recorded using a scan speed of 240 nm min- 1, a slit width of 5 nm, and with Spectralon® as a white standard. n-Butane (5 vol%, 50 cm 3 min- 1) isomerization was conducted at 378 K (tSZ) or 453 K (mpSZ), and n-pentane (1 vol%, 50 cm 3 min- 1) isomerization at 298 K (tSZ) or 323 K (mpSZ); and the gas phase was analyzed by on-line GC. After 16 h on stream, the samples were cooled to 298 K in He, treated first with 20 vol% O 2 in He (50 cm 3 min 1) for 1. 5 h, and then with water vapor in He (50 cm 3 min- 1) for 1. 5 h. The <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> was analyzed using a Pfeiffer Thermostar mass spectrometer. Results and discussion During n-butane and n-pentane isomerization, unsaturated surface deposits (absorption band at 300 - 330 nm, allylic-type species [1]) were formed on the surface of tSZ and during n-pentane isomerization on mpSZ, while the catalysts deactivated rapidly. Only during n-butane isomerization on mpSZ were nearly no changes in the UV-vis spectra with time on stream observed, and deactivation was slow. The spectra of the SZ samples with allylic type deposits showed only minor changes in the oxygen stream. Oxygen treatment of the mpSZ sample caused an overall intensity decrease between 250 and 450 nm within the first 5 min but no further changes. Nevertheless, fragments of hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives were registered in the mass spectra of the effluent stream for all samples. Fig. 1 : UV-vis spectra of tetragonal SZ During subsequent water vapor treatment of the SZ samples with allylic deposits, intense bands at about 380, 455 - 460, and 550 - 560 nm developed and the original band at 310 - 330 nm was reduced in intensity (Fig. 1). Bands at 430 - 455 nm have been assigned to quinone-type compounds [4], the other features are not yet explained. The spectrum of the mpSZ sample that had been deactivated in n-butane became similar to the spectrum of the activated state of this sample, with recovery of the overall intensity and the presence of absorption bands at 280 and 320 nm. The mass spectra of the gas phase during the water treatments showed the same fragments as during the oxygen treatment but with much lower intensity. The nature of the surface deposits on tSZ and mpSZ can be different depending on reactant and conditions. Surface deposits formed during alkane isomerization react with the components of air and are partially volatilized. Color changes consistent with the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 1 have been observed when taking deactivated samples out of the reactor. Surface deposits must thus be studied in situ. 1. 	R. Ahmad, J.

40|$|Adsorption using solid sorbents is {{recognized}} to be attractive to complement or replace the current absorption technology for CO 2 capture {{due to its}} low energy requirement. However, {{the development of new}} highly specific CO 2 adsorbent is necessary: a solution is represented by fine materials, whose properties can be tuned at a molecular level by means of functionalization processes to tailor their CO 2 capture performance. Another point to be addressed is the adoption of an adequate reactor configuration, which can, on one hand, fully exploit the potential and properties of these new-concept adsorbent materials by maximizing the contact between the CO 2 molecules and the adsorbent particles, and, on the other hand, improve the heat transfer. In this respect, a fluidized bed could be a good solution, due to larger gas-solid contact efficiency, higher rate of mass and heat transfer and lower pressure drops. In particular, a more suitable reactor configuration is a sound assisted fluidized bed, namely provided with a system for the generation of acoustic vibrations to overcome the high interparticles forces characterizing fine powders. On these bases, the present PhD thesis focuses on the CO 2 capture process by temperature swing adsorption on fine porous materials in a sound assisted fluidized bed. In order to perform adsorption/desorption tests, a laboratory scale sound assisted fluidized bed experimental rig has been set up. It is equipped with a system for the sound generation and with a continuous analyzer for the CO 2 concentration measurement in the <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b> For the regeneration tests the reactor is externally heated by an ad-hoc designed heating jacket, provided with a window to allow the fluidization quality to be visually assessed. Both common adsorbent materials, two activated carbons, zeolite HZSM- 5 and zeolite 13 X, and a highly specific adsorbent material, a metal organic framework HKUST- 1, were used. The experimental results show that the application of the sound can improve the fluidization quality as well as the adsorption efficiency (by maximizing the gas-solid contact) of all the selected adsorbent materials in terms of remarkably higher breakthrough time, adsorption capacity, fraction of bed utilized until breakthrough and adsorption rate. The experimental campaign has been also carried out, at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, in order to highlight the effect of some operating variables on the adsorption performances, i. e. sound intensity (120 - 140 dB) and frequency (20 - 300 Hz), CO 2 partial pressure (0. 05 - 0. 15 atm) and fluidization velocity (0. 1 - 4. 5 cm/s). In particular, increasing sound intensities yield better adsorption performances, whereas, sound frequency has a not monotone effect on the fluidization quality and adsorption efficiency. The CO 2 capture capacity increases with CO 2 partial pressure, coherently with the partial pressure being the thermodynamic driving force of the adsorption process. Finally, the dependence of the breakthrough time on the contact time is linear for the tests performed in ordinary conditions, whereas, it is not monotone for the sound assisted tests. At the end of the experimental campaign, all the investigated adsorbent materials have been compared and their different adsorption behaviours explained {{on the basis of their}} textural properties. In particular, it has been found that there is a specific pore size range, 8 - 12 Å, which is the key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of the studied materials under the investigated operating conditions. Desorption tests have been performed on the materials characterized by the best adsorption performances, the HKUST- 1 and one activated carbon at atmospheric pressure. In particular, an extra-situ regeneration strategy (150 °C under a vacuum of 50 mbar) has been developed to study the stability of HKUST- 1 to cyclic adsorption/desorption operations, since HKUST- 1 presents problems of thermal stability, limiting the desorption temperature to be used in a temperature swing adsorption process. The results show that HKUST- 1 is very stable, keeping its adsorption performances over 10 adsorption/desorption cycles. As regards the activated carbon, two strategy of temperature swing adsorption have been tested in the sound assisted fluidized bed. The first regeneration strategy is an isothermal purge consisting in combining the effect of increasing temperature and decreasing CO 2 partial pressure. The second regeneration strategy, heating and purge, consists in separating the thermal effect from the purging one. The application of the sound makes it possible, from one hand, to remarkably increase the desorption rate and, on the other, to significantly enrich the recovered CO 2 stream. CO 2 recovery and purity have opposing trends: higher desorption times yield a higher CO 2 recovery, but lead to a lower CO 2 purity of the desorbing stream. The desorption rate is positively affected by both desorption temperature (25 - 150 °C) and N 2 purge flow rate (45. 2 - 90. 4 Nl h- 1). The purity of the recovered CO 2 stream is increased by increasing desorption temperatures, whereas, it is not affected by change of the N 2 purge flow rate since dilution does not depend on the purge flow rate but only on the purge volume. The results obtained show that heating is very effective since 80 % of the captured CO 2 can be can be recovered with a 100 % purity at a bland desorption temperature of 130 °C. It is worth noting that for each desorption temperature the heating and purge strategy always makes it possible to enrich the stream of CO 2 recovered with respect to the standard purge strategy, the CO 2 recovery level being the same. The possibility to use the activated carbon in a cyclic operation has been also assessed: it is very stable, keeping its adsorption performances over 16 adsorption/desorption cycle. Finally, considerations about the energy cost and scale-up of the proposed technology for CO 2 capture by temperature swing adsorption have also been reported...|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} use of {{renewable}} energy in electricity generation has significantly increased over time, coal is projected to remain as the primary fuel in electricity generation worldwide in the next decades due to its availability, stability of supply and cost. However, coal-fired power plants are the largest stationary sources of CO 2 emissions that contribute to global warming. Several technologies {{have been developed to}} mitigate CO 2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Oxy-combustion is a promising pathway to capture CO 2 from coal fired power plants that competes favourably with other CO 2 capture technology pathways such as post-combustion and pre-combustion. Oxy-combustion has attracted attention because it provides a CO 2 -enriched flue gas stream which can be further purified using a relatively simple multi-stage compression and cooling processes. Currently, there is no oxy-coal-fired power plant in commercial-scale operation. Thus, the transition towards commercial scale operation is the main challenge for this technology. The CO 2 capture and purification unit (CO 2 CPU) is an important unit in oxy-coal-fired power plants that determine the quality of the CO 2 product and energy consumption of the power plants. Several studies published on the CO 2 CPU process have evaluated the performance of this system at steady state. Insight regarding the dynamic behaviour of the CO 2 CPU process is very limited and a mechanistic dynamic model of the CO 2 CPU is not available in open literature. Thus, research on dynamic modelling and control system development is still required to demonstrate the operability and controllability of this technology. This study aims to develop, test and validate a dynamic model of the CO 2 CPU for oxy-coal-fired power plants. Detailed mathematical models of each unit operation in the CO 2 CPU are provided in this study. The main challenge was to develop a dynamic model of a multi-stream heat exchanger that involves multiple process streams and encounters both condensing and boiling two phase flows. A dynamic model that is not computationally intensive, to slow down the entire CO 2 CPU plant model, and that can predict reasonable fluid temperatures in the multi-stream heat exchanger was developed in this study. The proposed multi-stream heat exchanger model was based on a shell and tube configuration that considers only axial changes in flow, i. e., a 1 D model. Likewise, the two phase region in this unit was modelled using a homogenous model, which is a simplified discretized two-phase flow model that reduces the computational effort and complexity of the multi-stream heat exchanger process model. The homogenous model takes into account the changes in the fluid properties in the two phase region to calculate the heat transfer coefficients of the multi-stream heat exchanger models. To the author’s knowledge, the model presented in this study represents the first mechanistic process model that describes the transient behaviour of a CO 2 CPU for oxy-fired power plant. Two design configurations of the CO 2 CPU were considered in this study, i. e. the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU and the CanmetENERGY’s proprietary CO 2 CPU (CanCO 2). Both plants are designed based on a two-stage flash separation process. The CanCO 2 is an extended design of the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. The presence of an external recycle stream, recycling a portion of the CO 2 rich <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> from the first flash drum to the compressor train, in the CanCO 2 is a major distinction between the two CO 2 CPU configurations and enhances the CO 2 capture rate for the CanCO 2 process. Nevertheless, the addition of this recycle stream makes the CanCO 2 plant model convergence more challenging than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU since it adds natural feedback into the system. A systematic procedure to perform the process integration of all the unit operations considered in the CO 2 CPU flowsheets was developed and presented in this study. Stand-alone unit operation models were developed, coded and then connected together one at a time. Dynamic models of the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU and the CanCO 2 were developed and validated at steady state using design data. Reasonable agreement between the developed models and the design data were obtained for both CO 2 CPU configurations. Several dynamic tests were performed to gain insight into the transient behaviour of the CO 2 CPU. The results obtained from the transient analyses clearly demonstrate that both CO 2 CPU plants are highly nonlinear processes. The CO 2 recovery and the CO 2 product purity obtained from the base case of both plants are similar, approximately at 89 wt% and 95 mol% respectively. The operating conditions of the first flash drum were found to play a key role on the CO 2 CPU performance of both plants. In addition, both models indicate that the CO 2 recovery is more sensitive to the operating conditions than that of the CO 2 product purity. The CO 2 purity is more sensitive to the flue gas composition and responds to all changes performed in this study faster than the CO 2 recovery. Because of the recycle stream, the CanCO 2 response to all changes is slower than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. Nevertheless, {{the use of}} a recycle stream improves the CO 2 recovery and increases the number of manipulated variables in the CanCO 2, thus this system has more alternative control structures than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. The models developed in this study can be extended to include the controllability analysis and the control structure design for the CO 2 CPU; and the integration of oxy-boiler, steam cycle and also air separation unit (ASU) into a complete dynamic model of the oxy-fired power plant that will be very useful for oxyfuel combustion technology scale-up...|$|E
