40|$|Heat-resistant cast steels {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to cracking {{as they are}} weld-repaired because of their very low ductility. To prevent weld-repair cracking of three different heat-resistant cast steels used for the manufacturing of superplastic forming (SPF) dies, the effect of various welding parameters, such as {{the choice of the}} filler material, the number of weld passes and the pre-heating temperature has been investigated. The choice of an appropriate filler metal and the pre-heating to 400 °C of the material prior to welding drastically lower the propensity to cracking, but remain unable to eliminate cracks entirely. To further reduce weld-repair cracking and hopefully prevent it completely, a buttering technique has been developed. Buttering of the base metal surface with nickel alloys before weld-repair has been shown to prevent cracking of the base metal, but results in some <b>hot-cracking</b> of the buttering layer itself. On the other hand, buttering with Ni-Fe alloys, less sensitive to <b>hot-cracking,</b> results in crack-free weld repairs...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} of determination of <b>hot-cracking</b> of metallic materials, {{which is based}} on laboratory application of the wedge rolling test and computer processing of the results obtained. The experiment was made with selected new types of high-alloyed free-cutting (ferritic and austenitic) steels. The initial specimens underwent an additional modification enabling easier development of cracks which consisted in milling out of the defined V-shaped notches on a side wall of a specimen. After taking specimens from the rolled material, we performed the metallographic analysis of microstructures by means of optical microscopy as well as a SEM analysis of the cracks. The resulting microstructure in the propagating crack vicinity was markedly influenced by this fracture. In the crack vicinity, a noticeable refinement of grains was observed due to the stress-induced recrystallization and occurrence of deformation zones that were pronounced by the rolled-out and stretched sulphides. As a rule, fractures were created by the ductile failure with visible pits, caused by tearing of sulphides from the material.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{magnetic}} fields to influence weld bead shape and dilution in laser welding {{of aluminium alloys}} was recently suggested. For the case of laser welding of <b>hot-cracking</b> sensitive aluminium alloys with silicon-containing filler wire it was already demonstrated that applying alternating magnetic fields {{has an impact on}} the dilution of silicon in the melt pool, yielding sufficient silicon content throughout the weld to suppress <b>hot-cracking.</b> This is due to the changed melt flow condition resulting from induced magnetic volume forces. In this paper, a CFD-based model will be presented that was used to numerically calculate the resulting velocity field for laser beam welding of aluminium with external applied magnetic fields. The model includes temperaturedepending material properties, surface tension and buoyancy. The inhomogeneous magnetic flux density distribution implemented in this model has been derived from Hall sensor probes of a welding head prototype used for experimental investigations.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} is {{a problem}} in welding 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy. Weld wire additives seem to reduce the problem. This study proposes a model intended to clarify the way alloying elements affect <b>hot-cracking.</b> The brittle temperature range of an alloy extends wherever the tensile stress required to move the meniscus of the liquid film at the grain/dendrite boundaries is less than the bulks flow stress Sigma(sub B) of the grains: 2 gamma/delta <= sigma(sub B) + P where gamma is boundary film surface tension delta= boundary film thickness P = gas pressure (Some alloys outgas.) If the above condition is not met, the grains deform under stress and the liquid film remains in place. Curves of 2 gamma/delta and sigma(sub B) vs. temperature in the range just below the melting temperature determine the hot cracking susceptibility of an alloy. Both are zero at onset of solidification. sigma(sub B) rises as the thermal activation of the slip mechanism is reduced. 2 gamma/delta rises as the film thickness delta which can be estimated from the Scheil equation, drops. But, given an embrittled alloy, whether the alloy actually cracks is determined by the strain imposed upon it in the embrittled condition. A critical strain is estimated, Epsilon(sub C) on the order of Epsilon(sub C) is approximately delta/l where L = grain size and where the the volume increment due to the strain, concentrated at the liquid film, is on the order of the liquid film volume. In the early 80 's an empirical critical strain cracking envelope Epsilon(sub C) (T) was incorporated into a damage criterion to estimate the effect of welding parameters on the formation of microfissures in a superalloy with good results. These concepts, liquid film decoherence vs. grain bulk deformation and critical strain, form the key elements of a quantitative theory of <b>hot-cracking</b> applicable for assessing the effect of alloying elements on <b>hot-cracking</b> during welding...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple theory of crack {{propagation}} in viscoelastic solids. We calculate the energy per unit area, G(v), to propagate a crack, {{as a function}} of the crack tip velocity v. Our study includes the non-uniform temperature distribution (flash temperature) in the vicinity of the crack tip, which has a profound influence on G(v). At very low crack tip velocities, the heat produced at the crack tip can diffuse away, resulting in very small temperature increase: in this "low-speed" regime the flash temperature effect is unimportant. However, because of the low heat conductivity of rubber-like materials, already at moderate crack tip velocities a very large temperature increase (of order of 1000 K) can occur close to the crack tip. We show that this will drastically affect the viscoelastic energy dissipation close to the crack tip, resulting in a "hot-crack" propagation regime. The transition between the low-speed regime and the <b>hot-crack</b> regime is very abrupt, which may result in unstable crack motion, e. g. stick-slip motion or catastrophic failure, as observed in some experiments. In addition, the high crack tip temperature may result in significant thermal decomposition within the heated region, resulting in a liquid-like region in the vicinity of the crack tip. This may explain the change in surface morphology (from rough to smooth surfaces) which is observed as the crack tip velocity is increased above the instability threshold...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to {{investigate}} the effect of oxide fluxes on weld morphology, arc voltage, mechanical properties, angular distortion and hot cracking susceptibility obtained with TIG welding, which applied to the welding of 5 mm thick austenitic stainless steel plates. A novel variant of the autogenous TIG welding process, oxide powders (Al 2 O 3, Cr 2 O 3, TiO 2, SiO 2 and CaO) was applied on a type 304 stainless steel through a thin layer of the flux to produce a bead on plate welds. The experimental results indicated that the increase in the penetration is significant with the use of Cr 2 O 3, TiO 2, and SiO 2. A-TIG welding can increase the weld depth to bead-width ratio, and tends to reduce the angular distortion of the weldment. It was also found that A-TIG welding can increase the retained delta-ferrite content of stainless steel 304 welds and, in consequence, the <b>hot-cracking</b> susceptibility of as-welded is reduced.

40|$|A new {{criterion}} for {{the appearance of}} hot tears in metallic alloys is proposed. Based upon a mass balance performed over the liquid and solid phases, it accounts for the tensile deformation of the solid skeleton perpendicular to the growing dendrites and for the induced interdendritic liquid feeding. This model introduces a critical deformation rate (�ε p,max) beyond which cavitation, i. e., nucleation of a first void, occurs. As should be expected, this critical value is an increasing function of the thermal gradient and permeability and a decreasing function of the viscosity. The shrinkage contribution, which is {{also included in the}} model, is shown to be of the same order of magnitude as that associated with the tensile deformation of the solid skeleton. A <b>hot-cracking</b> sensitivity (HCS) index �� 1 is then defined as εp,max. When applied to a variable-concentration aluminum-copper alloy, this HCS criterion can reproduce the typical ‘‘ � curves’ ’ previously deduced by Clyne and Davies on a phenomenological basis. The calculated values are in fairly good agreement with those obtained experimentally by Spittle and Cushway for a non-grain-refined alloy. A comparison of this criterion to hot cracks observed in ring-mold solidification tests indicates cavitation depression of a few kilo Pascal and tensile stresses in the coherent mushy zone of a few mega Pascal. These values are discussed in terms of those obtained by other means (coherency measurement, microporosity observation, and simulation). Even though this HCS criterion is based only upon the appearance of a first void and not on its propagation, it sets up {{for the first time a}} physically sound basis for the study of hot-crack formation.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} in welding {{is still}} an unresolved problem {{for a wide range}} of materials that restricts their use in production. Although free cutting steels are a prominent example of hot cracking sensitivity, other industrially important materials like high strength aluminium alloys, many austenitic steel grades and several high-temperature alloys are also prone to hot cracking. In all cases the actual forming of a hot crack is not only the consequence of metallurgical reasons but also of special thermomechanical conditions, namely too much tensile strain on the not fully solidified regions. Therefore it is not only possible to avoid the cracks by avoiding the mentioned metallurgical reasons, but also by reducing or counteracting any stress / strain on the <b>hot-cracking</b> critical zones. As the latter approach is much less discussed in the literature and only seldom pursued industrial application research, this article wants to emphasize its importance by introducing a new technique against hot cracks on this basis. A new process technique is presented which aims at reducing or avoiding hot cracking during laser welding. It is based on a tailored temperature field around the molten pool that changes the thermomechanical conditions of the material during the solidification of the weld. The required additional volumetric heat input is realized by inductive heating. The technique was tested successfully on strongly hot cracking sensitive heat treatable free cutting steels. The results of these tests show not only the relation between possible thermal and mechanical influences on the cracking intensity but also give important information about the possibilities and limits of the technique. Typical application areas are presented. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{ductility}} {{tests were}} used to determine the <b>hot-cracking</b> susceptibility of two low-carbon, low Mn/S ratio steels and compared with a higher-carbon plain C-Mn steel and a low C, high Mn/S ratio steel. Specimens were solution treated at 1623 K (1350 °C) or in situ melted before cooling at 100 K/min to various testing temperatures and strained at 7. 5 x 10 - 4 s - 1, using a Gleeble 3500 Thermomechanical Simulator. The low C, low Mn/S steels showed embrittlement from 1073 K to 1323 K (800 °C to 1050 °C) because of precipitation of MnS at the austenite grain boundaries combined with large grain size. Isothermal holding for 10 minutes at 1273 K (1000 °C) coarsened the MnS leading to significant improvement in hot ductility. The highercarbon plain C-Mn steel only displayed a narrow trough less than the Ae 3 temperature because of intergranular failure occurring along thin films of ferrite at prior austenite boundaries. The low C, high Mn/S steel had improved ductility for solution treatment conditions over that of in situ melt conditions because of the grain-refining influence of Ti. The higher Mn/S ratio steel yielded significantly better ductility than the low Mn/S ratio steels. The low hot ductility of the two low Mn/S grades was in disagreement with commercial findings where no cracking susceptibility has been reported. This discrepancy was due to the oversimplification of the thermal history of the hot ductility testing in comparison with commercial production leading to a marked difference in precipitation behavior, whereas laboratory conditions promoted fine sulfide precipitation along the austenite grain boundaries and hence, low ductility...|$|E
40|$|Nickel based {{superalloys}} {{were developed}} to withstand the severe thermal and mechanical environment associated with rocket propulsion systems and jet engines. In many alloy systems {{the strength of a}} component rapidly deteriorates as the operating temperature increases. Nickel based superalloys, however, retain strength over a range of temperatures which includes the operating range for many propulsion systems. This improved performance is accomplished by a combination of solid-solution strengthening, precipitation strengthening and grain-boundary strengthening. Furthermore, super-alloy systems are designed for ease of fabrication, to include machining, welding and heat treating. Inconel 718 was developed to overcome problems with post-weld cracking that were common in precipitation hardened nickel based superalloys strengthened by γ’. Inconel 718 is strengthened by γ’’ and is less sensitive to cracking during post-weld thermal treatment. However, in some cases, compositional changes which improved the behavior of these alloys during stress relief actually led to greater difficulty during the joining process. Many approaches have been used to determine the <b>hot-cracking</b> sensitivity of Inconel 718. Historically, two approaches have been particularly valuable because of their repeatability, their ability to compare different alloy systems and their verisimilitude to actual fabrication. These are the Gleeble hot-ductility test and the Variable-Restraint (Varestraint) weld test. Varestraint samples were prepared as per standard preparation techniques and tested longitudinally with a GTAW. At a predetermined location a strain was applied perpendicular to weld direction. The applied strain varied from 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 2. 0 %, and 4. 0 %. The Inconel 718 yielded a maximum crack length of 0. 6 mm with a saturation strain of 2. 0 %. Both the total crack length and the number of cracks did not have a saturation strain. Gleeble samples were prepared from rod stock and tested with standard methodology to determine the characteristic temperatures: nil ductility, nil strength, and ductility recovery temperature of Inconel 718. The samples were tested at various pull temperatures on-heating until the nil strength temperature then tested on-cooling with the nil strength temperature acting as the peak temperature. The nil strength temperature was 2273 °F, nil ductility temperature was 2182 °F, and the ductility recovery temperature was 1925 °F. Both the Varestraint and Gleeble results were compared with relevant literature to determine the weldability of the Inconel 718. Four criteria were used to determine the weldability of Inconel 718 and in three of the four tests; the Inconel 718 had equal to or greater weldability than the compared materials.
