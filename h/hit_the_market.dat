25|$|Chlordiazepoxide (initially called methaminodiazepoxide) was {{the first}} {{benzodiazepine}} to be synthesised in the mid-1950s. Chlordiazepoxide was synthesised from work on a chemical dye, quinazolone-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had hypnotic, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects. Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 diazepam <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> under the brand name Valium - and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades.|$|E

Meyer justifies the focus by stating that an increasing mobile and consumer electronics market does not shrink <b>the</b> traditional <b>market.</b> He wanted to address this markets later, when AMD is prepared to dedicate sufficient resources to address them well. This strategy lead to Bulldozer-architecture for the traditional PC-market, and Bobcat addressing the netbook and tablet market nearly exclusively dominated by Intel, both <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in 2011 and 2012.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the zinc–carbon battery {{continued}} to be a popular primary cell battery, but its relatively low battery life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named Lewis Urry, working for Union Carbide at the National Carbon Company Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that alkaline batteries held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting alkaline batteries were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a manganese dioxide cathode and a powdered zinc anode with an alkaline electrolyte. Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{market share}} loss, {{on a global}} basis, the number of active BlackBerry {{subscribers}} has increased substantially through the years. For example, for the fiscal period during which the Apple iPhone was first released, RIM {{reported that they had}} a subscriber base of 10.5 million BlackBerry subscribers. At the end of 2008, when Android first <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> RIM reported that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had increased to 21 million. Finally, in the quarter ended June 28, 2012, RIM announced that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had reached 78 million globally. After the release of the Apple iPhone 5 in September 2012 RIM CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the current global subscribers is up to 80 million, which sparked a 7% jump in shares.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Integrated Agricultural System's Food and Farm {{project is}} working with the region's sustainable-agriculture farmers, processors, distributors, chefs, {{planning}} commissions, and others to define the culinary identity of the region and direct the development of agrotourism. For instance, 75% of the raw-milk artisan cheese produced in Wisconsin is made in the Driftless region. This cheese is made from milk produced by cows that graze on pastures. The region is home to Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic dairy cooperative. Generally, organic dairy production fits best with a grass-based milk production system. In addition to winegrape production and wine-making, the region also is known for apple production, and a number of hard cider makers are about to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> with product. The region is historically known for grass-fed beef, and has great potential to market forest botanicals - especially mushrooms - to the 21 million people in the region, including the relatively nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Milwaukee markets.|$|E

25|$|Often {{the actual}} auto {{manufacturers}} {{would pay the}} cost of tooling. Such costs could range anywhere from $20,000 to $250,000 (Automotive News 1948; Donneley 2009;Ford Times 1961). The model companies were often pressed to get sales, display, paint and promotional details correct in order to offer the models to the “Big Three” before the real vehicles <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Detroit's annual model changes required last minute alterations in model details and showroom displays had to be finished {{in advance of the}} actual cars reaching the dealerships (Anderson 2003). One interesting example was AMT’s 1968 Chevy hardtop kit. AMT did not have access to GM’s 1968 details, so the resulting model was not correct (Doty 2000a, p88). Another example was the 1960 Ford Falcon promo that was offered in a hardtop, which was not available on the actual car (Doty 2002a, p88). Limitations of models offered also sometimes had interesting results. The 1966 Mercury Comet promo only came in a hardtop and that year a convertible paced the Indianapolis 500, so the 500 promo came in any style desired {{as long as it was}} a hardtop (Doty 2001, p89).|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel fermentation tanks radically changed the wine industry in warm climate regions like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of barrel fermenting whites as {{a throwback to the}} traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak has a long tradition in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{putative}} switch {{was planned}} all along {{to cover the}} change from sugar-sweetened Coke to much less expensive {{high fructose corn syrup}} (HFCS), a theory that was supposedly given credence by the apparently different taste of Coke Classic when it first <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> (the U.S. sugar trade association took out a full-page ad lambasting Coke for using HFCS in all bottling of the old formula when it was reintroduced). In fact, Coca-Cola began allowing bottlers to remove up to half of the product's cane sugar as early as 1980, five years before the introduction of New Coke. [...] By the time the new formula was introduced, many bottlers were already sweetening the drink entirely with HFCS.|$|E

2500|$|The {{early days}} of {{television}} provided movie studios a place to unload a backlog of short films that they thought otherwise unmarketable, and the Stooge films seemed perfect for the burgeoning genre. ABC had even expressed interest {{as far back as}} 1949, purchasing exclusive rights to 30 of the trio's shorts and commissioning a pilot for a potential series, Jerks of All Trades. However, the success of television revivals for such names as Laurel and Hardy, Woody Woodpecker, Popeye, Tom and Jerry and the Our Gang series in the late 1950s led Columbia to cash in again on the Stooges. In January 1958, Columbia's television subsidiary Screen Gems offered a package consisting of 78 Stooge shorts (primarily from the Curly era), which were well received. Almost immediately, an additional 40 shorts <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and by 1959, all 190 Stooge shorts were airing regularly. With so many films available for broadcast, daily television airings provided heavy exposure aimed squarely at children. Parents who had grown up seeing the same films in the theaters began to watch alongside their children and, before long, Howard, Fine and DeRita were in high demand. After it was discovered that the Curly-era shorts were the most popular, Moe suggested that DeRita shave his head to accentuate his slight resemblance to Curly Howard. He adopted first a crew cut and later a completely shaven head, thus becoming [...] "Curly Joe".|$|E
2500|$|Intel {{had tried}} unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh {{platform}} to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately {{would not be able}} to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 [...] offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against [...] "the Dells of the world".|$|E
