Due to the infinite dimensional and nonlinear characteristics, such models are highly complex, especially {{when all the}} phenomena of nucleation, growth and breakage are considered. Depending on the control problem under consideration, such a complexity can be useless and the control law can be designed {{on the basis of}} an <b>input-output</b> reduced <b>order</b> model of the process. In the present paper, we first consider a reduced order model of 6 ordinary differential equations obtained by the method of moments. By means of a sensitivity analysis and a parameter identification, it is shown that, to accurately describe the input-output behavior of the system whatever the conditions are, it is sufficient to change the values of only two parameters of this model, which is really interesting from a control point of view. However, when looking at the simulated data, the complexity of this moments model appears useless, from the input-output point of view. A second model reduction is therefore performed, based on physical assumptions.

In order to use the identified models for controller synthesis, linear time-invariant (LTI) realization theory is usually applied to derive a statespace model whose matrices depend statically on the scheduling signals, as required by most of the LPV control synthesis techniques. Unfortunately, application of the LTI realization theory leads to an approximate state-space description of the original LPV <b>input-output</b> model. In <b>order</b> to limit the effect of the realization error, a new set-membership algorithm for identification of input/output LPV models is proposed in the paper.

By making use of the behavioral approach, we will show that the consensus problem can be naturally rephrased as a special case of stabilization problem: the stabilization pertains only a part of the system variables (the outputs) and it is achieved through regular full interconnection of the agent models and of the controllers. It turns out that if the communication among agents is described by a weighted, undirected and connected graph, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the consensus problem to be solvable is that the output is stabilizable from the input in the agents model. In this respect, the theory here developed for higher-order input–output models naturally extends the results about consensus derived in the state-space approach...|$|R

In this context, especially Western European high-wage countries should have specialized on (human-) capital intensively manufactured goods and should have increasingly sourced labor-intensively manufactured goods, especially parts and components, from Eastern European low wage countries. Since this should be beneficial for the high-skilled and harmful to the lower-qualified workforce in high-wage countries, the opening up of Eastern Europe is often considered as a vital reason for increasing unemployment of the lower-qualified in Western Europe. This paper addresses this issue by analyzing the skill content of Western European countries’ bilateral trade using <b>input-output</b> techniques in <b>order</b> to evaluate possible effects of international trade on labor demand. Thereby, differences in factor inputs and production technologies have been considered, allowing for vertical product differentiation.

In data-driven modeling, selecting representative samples from a large set of data {{in a way that}} they can efficiently and accurately describe the whole dataset has been a long standing problem. This paper presents a new algorithm for the sample selection where the variances of output are observed for selecting representative <b>input-output</b> samples in <b>order</b> to ensure the quality of output prediction. The main idea is that representative pairs of input-output are chosen so that the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the corresponding output group does not exceed an application-dependent threshold. This output- and standard deviation-based sample selection is very effective in applications where the variance or relative error of the output should be kept within a certain threshold. This threshold is used for partitioning the input space using Binary Space Partitioning-tree (BSP-tree) and k-means algorithms. We apply the new approach to data-driven haptic modeling scenario where the relative error of the output prediction result should be less than a perceptual threshold. For evaluation, the proposed algorithm is compared to two state-of-the-art sample selection algorithms for regression tasks. Four kinds of haptic related behavior–force datasets are tested.

The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel (soybean, palm, rape, waste cooking oil) and bio-ethanol (sugarcane, sugarbeet, corn) were assessed and compared to fossil fuel (diesel and petrol) baseline. From one of the scenarios, biodiesel production from waste cooking oil and bioethanol from sugarbeet offer the biggest potential for emissions savings relative to fossil fuel equivalent and offering a maximum emission savings of 4. 1 % observed with a biofuel market share of 10 % reached in 2020. It was also established that under current biofuel feedstock mix, to achieve the 6 % emissions saving primarily from biofuels as proposed in the LCTP, 23. 8 % of the transport fuels market would be required to be held by biofuels by 2020...|$|R
