50|$|The desert {{whitethroat}} (Sylvia minula) is {{a typical}} warbler. Until recently, it was considered conspecific with the lesser whitethroat; today these are seen {{as members of a}} superspecies. The desert whitethroat together with Hume's whitethroat form an Asian lineage in the superspecies, which have diverged into species adapted to drier lowlands and moister mountain habitats respectively. The name small whitethroat has also been used by some authors, and <b>desert</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> before it was split from lesser whitethroat.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>{{whitethroat}}</b> complex {{has been}} split {{up into the}} present species, Hume's whitethroat, and the small whitethroat from which the Margelanic whitethroat may also be specifically distinct. In this superspecies, the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> seems to form the basal European lineage. Only two subspecies are nowadays unequivocally recognized for the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> and they intergrade throughout Central Europe: ...|$|R
50|$|The presumed <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> {{subspecies}} halimodendri and telengitica {{might actually}} {{belong to the}} desert whitethroat, or alternatively might represent hybrid intergrades between, respectively, S. m. jaxartica and S. m. margelanica and the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from Hume's and <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats</b> by its smaller size (12 cm length, 8-13 g weight), smaller bill, the uniformly paler grey head lacking the well-marked dark cheeks of Hume's and <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats,</b> and a lighter grey-brown back; in these differences it follows Gloger's rule of pale colour in arid regions. The throat is white, {{and the rest}} of the underparts pale greyish-white.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{bird species}} {{reported}} in the downs include the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> common linnet, yellowhammer, goldcrest and European green woodpecker.|$|R
50|$|The {{monotonous}} {{song of the}} cock is rattling trill, like Arctic warbler or {{the terminal}} rattle of <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> by its slightly larger size (13-14 cm), slightly stouter bill, and the darker {{top of the head}} and darker grey-brown back, which gives it less contrast between its upper head to back region than in <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b> The throat is white, {{and the rest of the}} underparts pale greyish-white. Their breeding ranges do not overlap; Hume's whitethroat inhabits upland regions from eastern Iran eastwards to the Tian Shan mountains of central Asia and the western ranges of the Himalaya. Hume's whitethroat breeds at altitudes of 2,000-3,600 m in open scrub, often with juniper, and in cultivated areas such as almond orchards. It migrates south to southern Pakistan and India in the winter, where it does overlap with wintering <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats</b> in some areas.|$|R
50|$|Rather, the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and {{its closest}} {{relatives}} Hume's whitethroat {{and the small}} whitethroat appear more related {{to a group of}} morphologically quite dissimilar species. These vary much in size and color pattern, but also lack chestnut wing patches and have a strong contrast between the usually dark head sides and the white or whitish throat. The latter group occurs from the southern parts of the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> complex' range into Africa and include the Orphean warbler group, the Arabian warbler, and the brown and Yemen warblers sometimes placed in Parisoma. Thus, it rather appears as if the divergence of the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> complex and its closest living relatives is more ancient than assumed, and that it did not involve separation by ice sheets building up in Europe, but by aridification of the Arabian region (which also occurred throughout the Ice Ages).|$|R
5000|$|Sylvia curruca blythi - Northeastern <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> - eastern {{parts of}} range. Has {{somewhat}} paler top of head, separated from face sides by white supercilium.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{breeding}} in the Caucasus Mountains and northwestern Iran {{have sometimes}} been considered intermediate between <b>lesser</b> and Hume's <b>whitethroats,</b> but {{are now more}} clearly assigned to <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> as the subspecies Sylvia curruca caucasica or even not separated from typical European S. c. curruca.|$|R
50|$|The Bonomi BS.15 Bigiarella (<b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat),</b> {{originally}} {{named the}} Bonomi BS.6 Bigiarella {{was a single}} seat glider, designed and built in Italy in 1934. Only three were constructed.|$|R
50|$|Desert {{whitethroat}} inhabits arid lowland regions {{from eastern}} Iran and Turkmenistan eastwards to Xinjiang in central China, breeding in open dry thorn scrub. The breeding range does not overlap with <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> occurring {{to the southeast}} of that; it does overlap geographically with Hume's whitethroat but is separated altitudinally. The desert whitethroat migrates south to the Arabian Peninsula, southern Pakistan and northwestern India in the winter, where it does overlap with wintering <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> in many areas, and more locally with wintering Hume's whitethroat. Vagrant is Sri Lanka, recorded in single time.|$|R
50|$|The park centres on Daventry Reservoir, which {{feeds the}} Grand Union Canal, {{and there are}} also meadows and crack willow woodland. Birds include yellowhammers, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats,</b> dunnocks and song thrushes.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{include the}} {{uncommon}} wild service tree, and breeding birds include spotted flycatcher, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> reed bunting and skylark. Featherstone Hill is a partly wooded {{hill in the}} south west of the site.|$|R
500|$|As of 2007, {{records of}} Wilson's snipe (from 1985 and 1998), [...] elegant terns (from 2002), {{a number of}} eastern <b>whitethroats</b> and <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats,</b> and several {{apparent}} North African common chaffinches, are still under consideration.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} two meadows which {{are rich in}} flowers, {{including}} many green winged orchids and adderstongue ferns. There is also a variety of common butterfly species, and hedgerows provide nesting sites for birds such as the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|R
50|$|This site in two disused railway {{cuttings}} {{has some}} plant species which are rare in Northamptonshire. Over 100 flower {{species have been}} recorded, including knapweed and devil's bit scabious. There are birds such as fieldfare, redwaing, wheatear, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> yellowhammer and linnet.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> (Sylvia curruca) is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} typical warbler which breeds in temperate Europe, except the southwest, and in western and central Asia. This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, wintering in Africa {{just south of the}} Sahara, Arabia and India.Unlike many typical warblers, the sexes are almost identical. This is a small species with a grey back, whitish underparts, a grey head with a darker [...] "bandit mask" [...] through the eyes and a white throat. It is slightly smaller than the whitethroat, and lacks the chestnut wings and uniform head-face color of that species. The <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat's</b> song is a fast and rattling sequence of tet or che calls, quite different from the whitethroat's scolding song.|$|R
50|$|Breeding birds include good {{numbers of}} nationally declining waders such as lapwing and redshank. Avocet also breed {{on the new}} pools. Yellow wagtail, skylark, sedge warbler, reed warbler, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> {{grasshopper}} warbler and reed bunting all occur. A colony of little egrets and grey herons breeds in a nearby wood.|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned at}} random to another paragraph. [...] "Lie quietly {{concealed}} in the fern and bramble {{in the gap}} by the old rowan tree, and you may see, almost every evening during early summer, a pair of <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats</b> creeping {{up and down the}} nettles and hedge-growth that mask their nesting-place." ...|$|R
50|$|Like most Sylvia species, it has {{distinct}} {{male and}} female plumages. The adult male has a grey back and head, brick-red underparts, and white malar streaks ("moustaches"). The female is mainly brown above, with a greyer head, and whitish below with a pink flush. The subalpine warbler's song is fast and rattling, and {{is similar to the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The site is {{a linear}} park {{along the banks of}} the Bonesgate Stream between Chessington Road and Filby Road. It adjoins Castle Hill LNR to the south and Hogsmill LNR (in Epsom and Ewell) to the north. It is mainly {{grassland}} with some coppiced hazel, which has the locally rare goldilocks buttercup. Birds include the great spotted woodpecker, song thrush and <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The western Orphean warbler is {{probably}} most closely allied to the Arabian warbler, {{as well as}} the brown warbler and Yemen warblers which are sometimes placed in Parisoma. They together with the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> group seem to form a distinct clade of typical warblers. The species therein do not appear much alike at first glance, but they all have prominent white throats, lack rufous wing-patches, and usually having dark sides to the head.|$|R
50|$|The National park also {{harbours}} a {{large number}} of birds. The number of species known to have nested in the national park amount to 132. The most numerous species are :mute swan, great cormorant, mallard, tufted duck, goosander, red-breasted merganser, eurasian oystercatcher, ruddy turnstone, common redshank, common sandpiper, common gull, great black-backed gull, european herring gull, Arctic tern, black guillemot, white wagtail, eurasian rock pipit, meadow pipit, northern wheatear, thrush nightingale, common <b>whitethroat,</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and hooded crow.|$|R
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Sylvia curruca caucasica is {{intermediate}} {{between the}} <b>lesser</b> and Hume's <b>whitethroats.</b>|$|R
5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and common whitethroat.|$|R
50|$|Aside from insects, {{which include}} the meadow grasshopper, migrant birds are {{also found in the}} area, either {{arriving}} or leaving via Portland. The scrub at the reserve provides shelter and habitat for them, although it also readily invades the open areas. Some bird species include <b>whitethroat,</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> meadow pipit, kestrel, green woodpecker amongst other migrant birds. On occasion both roe deer and the herd of feral goats that help to graze the cliffs on East Weares may be seen in the area. On {{the eastern edge of the}} quarry are some ponds which hold various amphibian species. The ponds are some of the very few that can be found on Portland.|$|R

50|$|To the west, {{the lakes}} are bounded by {{the site of}} special {{scientific}} interest Clowes Wood and New Fallings Coppice. The site was notified in 1973, and includes for 45.3 hectares (111.9 acres) of woodland, divided {{in part by the}} Birmingham to Stratford railway. The ancient woodlands are excellent examples of lowland mixed oakwoods, and support a large and important breeding bird population. Forty-nine species of woodland bird breed in Clowes Wood, including all three species of woodpecker and six species of tits, including willow tit. Also the wood warbler, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and grasshopper warbler breed regularly along with five other species of warbler. Predators include for Eurasian sparrowhawks, common kestrels and the tawny owl.|$|R
5000|$|Scratchwood is {{a remnant}} of the once great Middlesex Forest, and has the largest area of ancient {{woodland}} which survives in Barnet. Parts of it may {{go back to the}} woods which grew up {{after the end of the}} last ice age, the Younger Dryas, 11,500 years ago. The ancient woodland consists mainly of sessile oak and hornbeam, with some wild service trees, while secondary woodland areas are mainly birch, hawthorns and sycamore. In the view of the London Ecology Unit, [...] "Scratchwood is the Borough's best woodland in terms of floral diversity, especially of ancient woodland indicator species". The herb rich grassland and the pond have a number of rare plants. Breeding birds include nuthatch, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and cuckoo.|$|R
40|$|Individual, sex, age, {{seasonal}} {{and geographic}} variation of size and plumage coloration of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Whitethroat</b> Sylvia curruca (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied {{on more than}} 1100 bird skins {{from all parts of}} its breeding range. The results of analysis of birds from the south-eastern part of the breeding range of the species support the validity of five light-coloured subspecies: halimodendri Sushkin, 1904, telengitica Sushkin, 1925, snigirewskii Stachanow, 1929, minula Hume, 1873, and margelanica Stolzmann, 1897. Their diagnoses and ranges are refined and supplemented. Numerous phenotypically intermediate birds from intergradation zones between the subspecies show that these five together with the two northern darkcoloured forms S. c. curruca and S. c. blythi Ticehurst & Whistler, 1933, undoubtedly belong to a single species, and not to three species as in Shirihai et al. (2001) ...|$|R
