5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate,</b> tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate,</b> it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine phenolic and theobromine contents in dark (DC), milk (MC), and white (WC) chocolates commonly found in the Malaysian marketplace. Total phenolic and flavonoids were determined by means of a spectrometric assay, while catechin, epicatechin and theobromine were quantified using a reverse-phase HPLC method. <b>Dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> exhibited the highest phenolics and flavonoids contents, followed by milk and white chocolates. Catechin and epicatechin were major flavonoids detected in <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates.</b> Theobromine was detected in <b>dark</b> and milk <b>chocolates,</b> but not in white chocolates. A high correlation (r= 0. 93) between total phenolic and flavonoid contents, indicating that the major phenolic compounds in <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> belong to the flavonoid class. When nutrition and health promotion are of concern, <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> would be recommended over milk and white chocolates owing to their higher contents of antioxidant phenolic compounds...|$|R

40|$|Mapping food-evoked {{emotions}} {{in addition to}} sensory profiling is topical. In sensory profiling, the Temporal Dominance of Sensation (TDS) method focuses on {{the assessment of the}} temporal evolution of dominant sensory attributes over time. We hypothesize that food-evoked emotions also show temporal dynamics that can be related to dynamic sensory perception. This study assessed temporal dynamics of sensory and emotional attributes during chocolate tasting. We used TDS to determine dynamic sensory properties of <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> providing a list of 10 sensory attributes. Comparably, Temporal Dominance of Emotions (TDE) was assessed by replacing the sensory attributes with 10 emotional attributes. Sixty-two participants assessed TDS and TDE of five commercially available <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> (plain and flavoured). Multivariate comparisons (Hotelling test) showed significant differences between products based on the dominance duration of sensory (p < 0. 05) and emotional attributes (p < 0. 05). TDS difference curves revealed products to differ based on their dominant sensory attributes, with different attributes peaking at different time moments. TDE difference curves showed that products also differed in the temporal distribution of dominant emotional attributes. Comparing the average dominance rates between plain dark and flavoured <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> revealed that for flavoured <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> mainly flavour attributes and positive/active emotions were perceived as salient whereas for plain <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> textural as well as taste attributes were dominant accompanied by more negative/non-energetic emotions. A joint CVA plot on the duration of dominance for sensory and emotional attributes per product revealed that temporal evolution of sensory – and emotional attributes was related. This suggests a mutual reciprocity between those two entities (sensory and emotional attributes) resulting in more complex, richer product characterization. In conclusion, these findings show TDE to be a promising new venue in characterising food-evoked {{emotions in}} relation to sensory profiling...|$|R
40|$|High melting milkfat {{fractions}} are {{an interesting}} ingredient for chocolate manufacturing. So expensive cocoa butter or soft milkfat may be partly replaced by such fractions. <b>Dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> containing 2 percent of milkfat fraction (mp. 42 degrees C) are comparable in taste to normal chocolates but are much more stable against fat bloom. The addition of 5 percent milkfat fraction (mp. 42 degrees C) to <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> gives less good results, f. e. a rather soft chocolate and a special form of bloom after longterm storage. For milk chocolate manufacturing a replacement of up to 2 percent of cocoa butter against high melting fractions seems applicable.

25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate</b> has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg caffeine.|$|E

25|$|Chocolate {{is sold in}} {{chocolate}} bars, which come in <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate,</b> milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. Chocolate {{is used as a}}n ingredient in a huge variety of candy bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated {{in chocolate}}. Chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M's) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts). Some non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes.|$|E
25|$|The fur is soft, with dense underfur and long, coarse, thick guard hairs. The fur {{is not as}} shaggy or {{coarse as}} that of brown bears. American black bear skins can be {{distinguished}} from those of Asiatic black bears {{by the lack of}} a white mark on the chin and hairier footpads. Despite their name, black bears show a great deal of color variation. Individual coat colors can range from white, blond, cinnamon, or light brown to <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate</b> brown or to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Bluish-tinged black bears occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia. White to cream-colored black bears occur in coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of southwestern British Columbia. Albino specimens have also been recorded. Black coats tend to predominate in moist areas such as Maine, New York, Tennessee, Michigan and western Washington. Approximately 70% of all black bears are black, though only 50% of black bears in the Rocky Mountains are black. Many black bears in northwestern North America are cinnamon, blond or light brown in color, and thus may sometimes be mistaken for grizzly bears. Grizzly (and other types of brown) bears can be distinguished by their shoulder hump, larger size and broader, more concave skull.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur {{experiment}} involved seven {{panels and}} six <b>chocolates</b> – five <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> and one milk chocolate. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the sensory profiles of the chocolates. A natural question to ask is "Did the panelists detect any differences among the five <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates</b> or did they systematically contrast them with the milk chocolate?" The scatter plot of the chocolates obtained by principal component analysis was useless to answer that question, because of the proximity of the points. To overcome that, we used confidence ellipses calculated using bootstrap. The originality of the study lies in the fact that we applied those ellipses to hierarchical multiple factor analysis (HMFA) : among the seven panels, six were composed of trained professionals and the last one was composed of untrained students, and through that method, we managed to compare the two types of panels and balance the role of each trained panel. HMFA provides in a single scatter plot a representation of the six chocolates for each panel, the trained panels and all the panels. Confidence ellipses around each chocolate show that the combined panels – the six trained panels and also the untrained panel – differentiate the five <b>dark</b> <b>chocolates.</b> They also show how much larger the untrained panel's variability is than that of the trained panels, and how comparable are the trained panels' variability to each other...|$|R

500|$|Another trait {{unique to}} {{domestic}} sheep {{as compared to}} wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to <b>dark</b> <b>chocolate</b> brown, and even spotted or piebald. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning.
