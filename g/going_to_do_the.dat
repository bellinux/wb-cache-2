5|$|While {{sharing a}} bottle of wine with Gail, Lewis tries to kiss her. He later {{introduces}} her to his friend, Patrick (Simon Rouse), and pretends to turn down a job opportunity in Italy because he loves her. Lewis pays Patrick for his help and tells him that Gail ruined his life, so he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same to her. Lewis and Gail grow closer and begin dating in secret, although Lewis resists taking things further because of his feelings for Audrey. Lewis attempts to drive a wedge between Gail and her family, before telling her that he has been offered a new life in Italy, running a small hotel. Lewis asks Gail to come with him and she agrees. Audrey is devastated when she learns about their relationship, after catching them together. Gail takes out a £40,000 loan against her house to fund her trip to Italy, which Lewis plans on taking. He overhears Kylie speaking about a one-night stand she had with Nick and blackmails her into getting Gail's bank account password for him. Gail gathers her family together to tell them about Italy, but Lewis does not turn up. He instructs them by text message to watch a DVD he has made detailing his revenge plan. He reveals that he has taken Gail's money and that he deeply loved Audrey. The police later inform Gail that Lewis fled to Belize.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{entitled}} [...] "New Girl", {{the episode}} was written to interpret Gwen's [...] "first day in hell". On the sex gas, series creator Russell T Davies stated [...] "when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> sex monster". The episode was filmed during a three- to four-week period in May 2006, {{with much of}} it filmed before the first episode in the same production block. [...] "Day One" [...] was originally seen by 2.3 million viewers, {{making it one of}} the highest-rated BBC Three broadcasts of all time, but was met with generally mixed reviews.|$|E

500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, {{has given me a}} parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>The</b> Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E
500|$|After {{about two}} weeks the band had around 65 pieces of music. With {{engineer}} Andy Jackson back on the team, and Bob Ezrin as co-producer, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, Astoria. The band listened to and voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces of music. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about eleven songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed somewhat by Wright's decision to award his songs ten points each, and the other songs no points. Wright was not contractually a full member of the band, a situation which upset him. Wright reflected: [...] "It {{came very close to}} a point where I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair." [...] Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|Contractually, Wright was not {{a member}} of the band, and said [...] "It came close to a point where I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> album." [...] However, he earned five co-writing credits on the album, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Another {{songwriter}} credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson. She helped him write several tracks, including, [...] "High Hopes", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, [...] "pulled the whole album together," [...] according to Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: [...] "the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger". Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The album reached number 1 in both the UK and the US. It spent 51 weeks on the UK chart.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea behind}} using the sex gas came from Chibnall, but he {{admitted}} to having [...] "genuinely no idea where the episode came from". Davies stated [...] "when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> sex monster." [...] He also emphasised that the episode is not solely about [...] "having a laugh" [...] with the sex gas, as it also has [...] "something {{to say about the}} world". The scene where Carys walks down the street featuring sex in advertisements and couples kissing in public was one of Davies' favourite scenes in the episode, as it explores how [...] the Western world is. The episode was originally much lighter in tone, however, the majority of the comedic moments had to be cut on the final script, as they {{got in the way of}} the plot. Also, Carys was originally meant to have two or three boyfriends, but because of scheduling restrictions, there could only be one. This ended up being beneficial to the episode, as it made it more emotive. There was a scene that would be filmed with Carys and a second boyfriend, but that would be cut and added on the deleted scenes on the DVD boxset of the first series.|$|E
500|$|Malachy later {{witnessed}} Mercedes and Calvin kissing {{but did not}} interrupt them. Wallace {{felt this}} was because he truly loved Mercedes and had accepted that [...] "his life is much better with Mercedes in it". Whittle explained that Malachy tested Mercedes and Calvin {{because he wanted to}} discover if [...] "what he saw was a one-off or more serious". The pair failed the test and Mercedes, fearing that Malachy knew the truth, told Calvin that they had to end their affair, [...] "but they simply can't stay away from each other". He added that the relationship could become more serious for Calvin as [...] "he's in danger of really falling for her". Mercedes began to develop feelings for Calvin who did not expect Mercedes to develop [...] "such deep feelings" [...] for him. When Calvin rejected Mercedes she informed Calvin's sister Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) that Calvin left Sasha's then boyfriend Warren to die in a fire; Sasha responded to the revelation by throwing Calvin out of their home. Not being able to [...] "get past what happened with Warren", Calvin and Carmel decide to end their relationship. Calvin confronted Mercedes, who [...] "tells him that he's ruined her life and warns that she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same to him".|$|E
500|$|The writers {{also used}} details from real-life {{criminal}} investigations in their script. During one scene in [...] "Ghost of a Chance", a busload of rookie police officers {{straight out of}} the academy are brought in to investigate a crime scene. The New York Police Department employed exactly the same tactic while searching for the remains of a missing girl in upstate New York in 1987. One episode written by Tom Fontana, [...] "Three Men and Adena", took place entirely {{within the confines of the}} police interrogation room known colloquially by the detectives as [...] "The Box". Fontana was partially inspired to write it by comments made by Barry Levinson during filming of an interrogation scene in [...] "Gone for Goode", when Levinson said the acting by Braugher and Secor was so good, an entire episode could be filmed around it. Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show, but he said, [...] "It was important for [...] Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same old show every week." [...] Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process.|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] was {{directed}} by Martin Campbell and written by Tom Fontana, executive producer of Homicide: Life on the Street. The interrogation room at the homicide division, colloquially referred to by detectives as [...] "The Box", is a setting that appears in almost every episode of Homicide: Life on the Street. While filming an interrogation scene there in [...] "Gone for Goode", the first episode of the , director Barry Levinson commented to Fontana that the acting from Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor was so effective, an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation. The comments partially inspired Fontana to write [...] "Three Men and Adena". Fontana said, [...] "I only {{had the courage to}} write that episode {{based on the fact that}} I had seen what (Braugher and Secor) could do in the pilot episode". Almost the entire episode of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] takes place within the confines of the police interrogation room with Braugher, Secor and Moses Gunn, the actor who guest starred as Risley Tucker. It was Gunn's final acting role before his death in December 1993. Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show, but he said, [...] "It was important for Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same old show every week." ...|$|E
500|$|Orton began feuding {{with the}} McMahon {{family on the}} January 19, 2009 episode of Raw when he confronted both Mr. McMahon and Stephanie, {{claiming}} that he was worth more than her, {{and that she had}} become [...] "worthless". This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he'd terminate him on the spot. As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked him and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher. On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H. The next night on Raw, Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a [...] "loss of control" [...] because of the disorder. He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, {{due to the fact that}} he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble. Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said she had [...] "bigger plans", leading to Shane McMahon returning to Raw and attacking Orton. This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won. The next night on Raw, Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match. Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an RKO. This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton [...] "crossed the line" [...] when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife. Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution; according to Orton, Triple H [...] "ruined his life", so Orton was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same and take everything that Triple H cared about away from him. He challenged Triple H for the WWE title at WrestleMania XXV, which he was unsuccessful. He won it the next month at Backlash by pinning Triple H in a special six-man tag team match between The Legacy and Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon. At Extreme Rules, he lost the title to Batista in a Steel Cage match. The following night on Raw, Orton and Legacy attacked Batista and broke his arm, forcing him to vacate the title. On the June 15 Raw, Orton regained the title in a fatal four-way match, over Triple H, John Cena and Big Show. He lost the title to John Cena in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at Breaking Point. He then regained it from Cena in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell. At Bragging Rights, Orton again lost the title to Cena in a one-hour Iron Man match.|$|E

2500|$|Van Zandt's {{third and}} final {{marriage}} was to Jeanene Munsell (born February 21, 1957). They met on December 9, 1980 at a memorial for John Lennon.

In a following interview with Noisey, Weinman said the Dillinger Escape Plan would stop performing, with Puciato later saying [...] "we're breaking up." [...] Puciato was quoted saying that the band still enjoyed writing, recording and performing together but nonetheless [...] "we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band", comparing the decision to a filmmaker who enjoys the current film his is creating but can't continue the process indefinitely. Weinman said [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> cycle for this album and that's it."

2500|$|In September 1992, Disney began casting actors for Pocahontas telling talent {{agents that}} they were {{particularly}} interested in Native American actors for the project. For the role of Pocahontas, Broadway actress-singer Judy Kuhn was hired to provide the singing voice for the eponymous character before Irene Bedard was cast. Kuhn explained, [...] "They said, 'You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> dialogue unless we find a Native American actress whose singing voice matched yours.' I was cast before Irene, so it actually went backwards." [...] Bedard herself was filming [...] where she was informed by the casting director {{that they were}} looking for someone to voice the title role. According to Bedard, she took a train to Buffalo, New York where she was walked in wearing a sundress and a straw hat, and read for the part. Back on the set of Lakota Woman, she learned that she was cast in the role. Michelle St. John had also auditioned for the role of Pocahontas, and was given the role of Nakoma after Bedard was cast.|$|E
