5|$|During the {{previous}} years, The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed on October 15, 2012, {{as the first}} step of the creation of an autonomous political entity named Bangsamoro. However, territorial <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> eastern Sabah and the South China Sea have escalated.|$|E
5|$|The {{county was}} further divided into districts, each {{consisting}} {{of at least}} several hamlets grouped together; typically a community of approximately one hundred families. A chief of police was assigned to each district by the county Magistrate. A county Magistrate heavily relied on the cooperation of local elders and leaders at the district level; these carried out much of the day-to-day affairs of arbitrating <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> their communities, collecting taxes, and fighting crime.|$|E
5|$|Galerius, meanwhile, {{was engaged}} during 291–293 in <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Upper Egypt, where he {{suppressed}} a regional uprising. He {{would return to}} Syria in 295 to fight the revanchist Persian empire. Diocletian's attempts to bring the Egyptian tax system in line with Imperial standards stirred discontent, and a revolt swept the region after Galerius' departure. The usurper L. Domitius Domitianus declared himself Augustus in July or August 297. Much of Egypt, including Alexandria, recognized his rule. Diocletian moved into Egypt to suppress him, first putting down rebels in the Thebaid {{in the autumn of}} 297, then moving on to besiege Alexandria. Domitianus died in December 297, by which time Diocletian had secured control of the Egyptian countryside. Alexandria, however, whose defense was organized under Domitianus' former corrector Aurelius Achilleus, was to hold out until a later date, probably March 298.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, the {{competition}} was contested by sixteen clubs. In the first stage, the clubs were divided in four groups of four teams each. The two best placed clubs of each group qualified to the quarterfinals, which was <b>disputed</b> <b>in</b> two legs. The semifinals were <b>disputed</b> <b>in</b> one leg, and the final was <b>disputed</b> <b>in</b> two legs. All matches were played in cities located in Northeastern and Northern cities.|$|R

5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse this assignment, likely due to the ongoing <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia between the clergy and the lay trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent little time in the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E
5|$|In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and {{captured}} Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. Æthelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He {{also managed to}} secure professions of obedience {{from a number of}} southern bishops, including Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions could be made on the dispute.|$|E

Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it {{is a joint}} initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. The project {{is part of the}} ongoing modernization and development of the capital. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership <b>disputes.</b> <b>In</b> March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate vehicle access in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah'ow, the reconstruction initiative will also make the road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> papal elections, as he did when he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> {{paleontology}} have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha {{gains in}} the north were undone because of the {{contradictory}} policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> {{the family of the}} Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> some animals.|$|E

5|$|Blankett and Elphinstone united off the Cape on 10 June 1795 and {{anchored}} in Simon's Bay. There messages {{were sent to}} Sluysken offering an alliance against the French. The Dutch governor was inclined to resist however, evacuating the civilian population from Simon's Town in early July and making preparations to raze the town. To prevent this, Craig landed 800 soldiers and Royal Marines on 14 July, who occupied Simon's Town while the Dutch withdrew to the pass at Muizenberg, through which passed the road to Cape Town. For the next month the two armies observed an uneasy truce, broken by occasional patrols and sniping. During this period, Elphinstone and Sluysken continued negotiations for the surrender of the colony. These negotiations were stalled by <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> the colonial government regarding {{the legitimacy of the}} deposed William of Orange and suspicion concerning British intentions. While the debates continued, British envoys were permitted free movement in Cape Town, making detailed observations of the defences.|$|E
5|$|During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa {{was home}} to local power brokers, who {{mediated}} <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936–1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, and shifted to labor jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, {{the majority of the}} residents—men and women—continued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al-Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa's lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.|$|E

5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E
5|$|The Peninsular War in Spain, {{along with}} the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville, {{escalated}} political <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted {{for the creation of a}} Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. Azcuénaga lend his house to their secret meetings. Azcuénaga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta, and promoted to brigadier. The reasons of Azcuénaga's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy; besides being from the armed forces, Azcuénaga had close ties with the rich people of the city.|$|E
5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land <b>disputes</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E
