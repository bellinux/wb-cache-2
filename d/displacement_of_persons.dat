The sad smile of the lady moved his rough heart to pity.

Wenham and Wagg both knew him and his circumstances. He had worked with the latter, and was immeasurably his superior in wit, genius, and acquirement; but Wagg's star was brilliant in the world, and poor Shandon was unknown there. He could not speak before the noisy talk of the coarser and more successful man; but drank his wine in silence, and as much of it as the people would give him. He was under surveillance. Bungay had warned the undertaker not to fill the Captain's glass too often or too full. It was a melancholy precaution that, and the more melancholy that it was necessary. Mrs. Shandon, too, cast alarmed glances across the table to see that her husband did not exceed.|$|E

40|$|The {{conflict}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region {{has had a}} significant impact on the interstate and intrastate <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> From 1989 to 1993, more than 300, 000 ethnic Armenian refugees arrived in Armenia alone. Many of these refugees still face socio-economic hardship, are unemployed and live in temporary shelters. After ten years of transition, the persistence of these socio-economic difficulties demonstrates a critical need for a permanent solution. The Government of Armenia (GoA) considers integration to be the only tenable long-term response to the refugee issue. At present, this process has reached the phase of naturalisation, which has been unsuccessful. Ethnic Armenian refugees are not willing to forego their refugee status and resist acquiring citizenship. This paper explores whether a naturalisation policy will ensure the full integration of ethnic Armenian refugees. The project is explorative and focuses on why refugees seem to postpone acquiring Armenian citizenship and explores the question of whether refugees lose benefits in giving up refugee status [...] In addition, the study reveals serious obstacles to the integration process that are not addressed by naturalisation and provides recommendations for future steps...|$|R

40|$|Intensifying {{processes}} of globalization {{have led to}} a series of tensions around the way in which even the most cosmopolitan democracies now treat people who move across their borders.

40|$|Objective. Among the {{countries}} of the Americas, Colombia has the highest level of deaths due to homicides and armed conflict. The objective of this research was to combine and con-trast information from various sources on deaths due to violence in Colombia in order to iden-tify major trends in violence in the country and to compare those trends with those in other nations of the Americas. Methods. We drew together information from a wide array of sources, including the Gov-ernment of Colombia, Colombian forensic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and international research centers. We considered the impact of the violence on mortality as well as in such areas as nonfatal injuries, <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> and kidnappings. Results. While there have been many deaths in Colombia directly related to military con-flict, there have been many more deaths and injuries as an indirect result of war. The highest levels of deaths directly related to violence occurred during the 1990 – 1995 period. Although deaths due directly to armed conflict declined in the late 1990 s, the related events of kidnap-pings and displacement did not. Conclusions. Efforts to reduce the violence-related suffering in Colombia must consider both direct and indirect causes of mortality as well as nonfatal outcomes such as kidnappings and displacement...|$|E
40|$|This Research is {{financed by}} {{personal}} {{contributions of the}} three authors Conflict management {{is the process of}} reducing the negative and destructive capacity of conflict through a number of measures and by working with and through the parties involved in that conflict. However, scholars have not addressed how latent conflicts can be managed by the parties involved without any feeling of grievance or betrayal among the conflicting groups. This study was set to examine mechanisms of conflict management over common pool resources among residents of lower river Nyando floodplains and to explore the appropriate means of managing conflicts. The recurrence of conflicts in the lower River Nyando floodplains despite the interventions by different actors called to attention the need to address these conflicts.

Such systems should be able to detect and recognize human activities, with as little human intervention as possible. In this work, we model the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person</b> in consecutive frames using a bank of switched dynamical systems, each of which tailored to the specific motion regimes that each trajectory may contain.

30|$|Evacuations are {{normally}} {{assumed to be}} short-lived. However, the extent of a hazard’s impacts, the lack of adequate responses, and individual conditions of vulnerability can result in the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> affected <b>persons</b> for much longer periods.

40|$|The forced <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> within and/or across {{national}} borders {{has been one}} of the most tragic and persistent issues of the twentieth century and it is likely to remain with us well into the twenty-first. The refugee phenomenon concerns that of flight across borders. While it is often associ-ated and shares many characteristics with flight within nations, which gives rise to the phenomenon of internally displaced persons (IDPs), it is, unlike the latter, the object of a relatively well established, if in some respects fragmented, international regime. While the international regime of IDPs is still in gestation, albeit a rapidly developing one, that of refugees started soon after the First World War with-in the context of the League of Nations. This course will start with an introduction to the concept of international protection of refugees and an examination of the various international attempts since 1921 to meet the problem of the forced movements of people due to persecution or armed conflict. This will be followed by an introduction to the basics of international refugee law, including the gaps in this body of law. This will in turn lead to a comparative study of the refugee definitions as a basis for the determination of refugee status (RSD), the issue of the safe third country and the problem of responsibility for determining an asy-lum claim, and other contentious issues relating to RSD...|$|E
40|$|Urban renewal {{has always}} been {{undertaken}} to clean up and beautify a city in accordance with a prescribed new layout plan. Many unintended consequences, especially forceful evictions and internal <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> however, usually accompany such exercises. This paper aims to examine the socio-economic and health implications of urban renewal for residents of Ogun State, Southwestern Nigeria. In the last five years, massive urban renewal programs have been implemented in five local government areas (LGAs) in the State: Abeokuta North, Ado/Odo Ota, Sagamu, Yewa South and Ijebu Ode from which two (Abeokuta North and Ado-Odo/Ota) were purposively selected for this study. Primary data was obtained through administration of questionnaires to 380 randomly selected affected adults with demolished houses or shops, and analysed using logistic regression. The results indicated that urban renewal had a significant {{negative impact on the}} occupation (odds ratio = 3. 0; p < 0. 01) and income (p < 0. 01) of affected persons. Urban renewal had also significantly affected the health status of respondents because those whose houses or shops were demolished were 12 times more likely to suffer depression from loss of sleep (odds ratio= 12. 08; p< 0. 01), loss of appetite (p< 0. 01) and feelings of hopelessness (p< 0. 01). It is therefore recommended that urban renewal in Nigeria should be more holistic (cater for the needs of people who are likely to be affected and get them involved from start to finish before demolition) to avoid these associated side effects...|$|E

The emergence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in northeastern Brazil in the state of Ceará illustrates how environmental and human factors combine to influence human health. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an important health problem for residents of Ceará. In the 20 years from 1986 to 2005,> 49, 000 new cases were reported (Figure 1) (1). Given the difficulties in reporting in rural areas, the true number is likely substantially higher. Today, the disease is distributed across several areas in the state, but this has not always been the case. In fact, historical data suggest that cutaneous leishmaniasis is a relatively recent arrival and may have come from the Amazon region as a consequence of drought, smallpox, and social and economic conditions that led to human migration. The first well-documented cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ceará date back to 1925 when photograph...|$|E

40|$|The largest {{outbreak}} of poliomyelitis ever recorded in Africa (1093 cases) occurred from 1 March to 28 May 1999 in Luanda, Angola, and in surrounding areas. The outbreak was caused primarily by a type- 3 wild poliovirus, although type- 1 wild poliovirus was circulating in the outbreak {{area at the}} same time. Infected individuals {{ranged in age from}} 2 months to 22 years; 788 individuals (72 %) were younger than 3 years. Of the 590 individuals whose vaccination status was known, 23 % had received no vaccine and 54 % had received fewer than three doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The major factors that contributed to this outbreak were as follows: massive <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> unvaccinated <b>persons</b> to urban settings; low routine OPV coverage; inaccessible populations during the previous three national immunization days (NIDs); and inadequate sanitation. This outbreak indicates the urgent need to improve accessibility to all children during NIDs and the dramatic impact that war can have by displacing persons and impeding access to routine immunizations. The period immediately after an outbreak provides an enhanced opportunity to eradicate poliomyelitis. If continuous access in all districts for acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and supplemental immunizations cannot be assured, the current war in Angola may threaten global poliomyelitis eradication...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of knowing one's {{position in a}} precise and reliable way, at any time, with and without reception of satellite signals, represents an area fairly explored for the navigation of vehicles. To widen this service to the pedestrians requires a different approach that adapts to the dynamics, to the speed and especially to the total freedom of movement of the people. The traditional approach implements a triad of accelerometers and gyroscopes, which signals are integrated to obtain the relative displacement. This concept is unfortunately not judicious for a low-cost system. The principal {{reason is that the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person</b> is lost in the sensor noise level. In order to take into account all these specificities, an occurential approach was developed, based upon a subset of sensors as well as physiological and biomechanical parameters of the walk. This research is divided into three main directions. The first area of interest consists in the determination of the physiological parameters necessary to quantify the speed of walk and the step length. While the agitation of the accelerometer signals is a good speedometer, the frequency of the steps improves the robustness of the models. The influence of the gender added to the great human diversity imply the normalisation of the various relations deduced. Many tests carried out under conditions of everyday life reveal that the variation of the stride length, especially with the slope, strongly depends on the physical training <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> {{as well as on the}} duration of the climb or descent. Characteristic pattern were identified to differentiate between the forward, backward and lateral movements. The various suggested models were then favourably tested with some blind people, whose walking rhythm strongly varies according to the degree of confidence they have towards the course. The second part directly relates to the multiple technologies integrated to build an autonomous three-dimensional Pedestrian Navigation Module (PNM). The knowledge of the terrestrial magnetic field and its orientation makes it possible to determine the azimuth <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person.</b> The use <b>of</b> a gyroscope improves the reliability of the system and facilitates the detection of magnetic disturbances. More stable in the short term than the compass, it is therefore the optimal complement under such circumstances. The altimetric information is obtained by barometric measurements which, according to the required precision, can be differential. The implementation of a GPS receiver allows the absolute positioning simultaneously to the calibration of the different sensor parameters and physiological models. The third part describes the integration of the models and measurements as well as the characteristics and treatments specific to pedestrian navigation. An initialisation phase is presented to individualize the parameters of the walk and adapt them from the general model. Hence, thanks to the compass-gyroscope integration together with the detection of any movement, this allows an optimal determination and filtering of the azimuth that has little or no temporal degradation. The consideration of several phenomena specific to the <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> the humans brings artificial intelligence in pedestrian navigation. The coupling of the various sources of measurements, the influence of their precision on the computed position as well as their implication on the PNM reliability are described and illustrated. More than 550 km covered in various circumstances by 31 people allowed to validate the presented approach while fixing its limits...|$|R
40|$|National audienceSince {{approximately}} 10 years, {{research in}} medieval art history has aknowledged both {{the importance and}} the great range of the mobility of artists, works of art and models during the Middle Ages. However the questions raised by such circulations are not only that of the identification of those circulations. By using the notion of artistic transfers, the analysis presented here wants to understand artists', works of art's and models' circulations in their dynamic relation with both their origin and host cultural environment. The term {{and the notion of}} "artistic transfers" implies indeed a <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> objects or terms from a cultural space to another. It is relevant for art history as it allows to adress the problem in other terms than those of artistic influence or reception. It is therefore very useful {{to take into account the}} disruptive dimension of such circulations and the "political and cultural conjuntures" (M. Espagne and M. Werner) such transfers suppose in the relation between different cultural areas. Such an approach also allows to raise a variety of questions that have rarely been dealt with regarding the social availability of artists, homogeneity of technical or cultural practices and the permeability of knowhows. What is the signification of those artist's presence so far away from their original areas ? Which were the reasons and "political conjuntures" explaining those circulations ? Furthermore, which were the constraints outsider artists were submited to ? Did those contraints have any influence on their production and its elaboration ? What was the place assigned to this production in their host system ? In return, have the system they came from been reconfigured by those transfers ? All those questions, and many more, can be answered by an analysis in terms of artistic transfers. The mechanisms at stake should be pictured in a larger frame than that of art history only, as they are dependent on the very cultural possibilities of such exchanges. La mobilité des artistes et des œuvres en Europe au Moyen Âge, dont le constat a déjà été établi, constitue un objet de recherches pour les historiens de l'art depuis plusieurs années. Cependant, les questions soulevées par ces déplacements dépassent le simple repérage du parcours des hommes ou des œuvres. Leur analyse à travers la notion de transferts artistiques - elle-même reprise de la notion de transferts culturels et impliquant un déplacement d'une aire culturelle à une autre - permet d'appréhender ces circulations humaines et matérielles dans le rapport dynamique et dialectique qu'elles entretiennent avec leurs milieux d'accueil et de réception. Cette notion, particulièrement pertinente pour notre discipline, permet de déplacer le problème, trop souvent encore centré autour de la question des influences ou de la réception, et de prendre en compte la dimension perturbatrice des transferts...|$|E
