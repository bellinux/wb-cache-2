500|$|The choreography, {{in which}} Astaire was {{assisted}} by Hermes Pan, is principally concerned throughout with {{the possibilities of}} using taps to make as much noise as possible. In the film, Astaire [...] suffers from what Rogers terms an [...] "affliction": [...] "Every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> suddenly find myself dancing." [...] Astaire introduces the film's tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club. There are eight musical numbers.|$|E
500|$|This {{title of}} [...] "Spokesman of a Generation" [...] was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came {{to feel it}} was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, Chronicles, Dylan wrote: [...] "The press never let up. Once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> would have to rise up and offer myself for an {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline [...] "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman". I felt {{like a piece of}} meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked so hard, and people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2008, {{the artist}} has added one song to his sophomore LP, which may {{be out on the}} last quarter of 2008 or first quarter of 2009. Lewis told the interviewers that he is very excited to premiere his new songs, and he has learned some lessons from his [...] "A.D.D." [...] era. On an interview, he said, [...] "Where to start… Orchestral Drive-By: KJ and I are about 5 songs deep now. Can’t wait for you all to hear this. I haven’t been this excited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> haven’t been able to produce in a year and half, besides a couple songs on ‘A.D.D.’ and from what I have learned in the last year, it sure has paid off.

5000|$|Rita, {{his last}} wife, {{when asked about}} Anthony's hair-trigger temper said, [...] "He was never taught how to control his temper ... I changed him a lot ... We still have good fights once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but <b>I</b> can scream back at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma is {{real well}} again," [...] she said. [...] "Better, in fact, than {{she has been}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> know she feels {{relieved}} to think that Dick can now take charge of all of her affairs, and of my affairs, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} my opinion of Equity," [...] {{returned}} the young man. [...] "If I didn't have you here to free my mind to once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> don't know what I should do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{sometimes}}," [...] replied Little Joe. [...] "Once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> like {{a little}} fresh meat for a change, and sometimes when fish are scarce I eat Frogs, but I prefer fish, especially Salmon and Trout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I do have queer impulses," [...] replied Neale, as he {{felt his}} face grow white. [...] "Every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> see a flash--of--of I don't know what. I could do {{something}} big--even--now--if my heart wasn't dead." ...|$|E
60|$|We twisted {{ourselves}} about, and lay {{as still}} as death, with every sense alert. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> did not doubt that something was quietly ascending the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself of a good grip on my chain, and waited for that something to appear.|$|R
60|$|She {{acknowledged}} {{her identity}} with a nod. It was Wolf Larsen’s {{turn to be}} puzzled. The name and its magic signified nothing to him. I was proud that it did mean something to me, {{and for the first}} time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> weary <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him.|$|R
60|$|He blushed to his eyes, and I repented. She {{suddenly}} {{began to}} laugh; {{it was then}} I observed how sweet her voice was in laughter. We talked after this of various matters, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> complimented her on her excellent English, {{and asked if she}} had learnt it in England.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am never hurt," [...] {{said the}} Sawhorse. [...] "Once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> get broken up some, but I am easily {{repaired}} {{and put in}} good order again. And I never feel a break or a splinter in the least." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{absence of}} gulls along {{this stretch of}} reef is a feature that struck me.

"There {{would be}} some sport," [...] said John Harned, [...] "if a toreador were killed once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> When <b>I</b> become <b>an</b> old man, and mayhap a cripple, and should I {{need to make a}} living and be unable to do hard work, then would I become a bull-fighter.

But, just the same, he isn't to be trusted." ...|$|E
60|$|Insects {{have mostly}} {{vanished}} {{in the fields}} and woods. I hear locusts yet, singing in the sunny hours, and crickets have not yet finished their song. Once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> see a caterpillar,--this afternoon, for instance, a red, hairy one, with black head and tail. They {{do not appear to be}} active, and it makes one rather melancholy to look at them.|$|E

60|$|Towards six o'clock, I {{felt the}} warning which {{told me that}} my pains were coming back.

6000|$|... "It's a pity she doesn't make <b>a</b> mistake <b>in</b> cooking once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> herself," [...] <b>I</b> said. [...] "Then {{maybe she}} wouldn't think she knew {{so much more}} than other people." ...|$|R
6000|$|LEIPZIG, 25th JANUARY, 1763. [...] "Thanks {{for your}} care about my existence.

[...] "By curbing such inclinations in my daughters we keep on the safe side.

60|$|So {{we began}} to descend.
