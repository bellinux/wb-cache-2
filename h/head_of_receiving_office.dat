40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how food is distributed to various family members differing in age, sex, earning status, family role, and status as target child in families enrolled in supplementary feeding programs in urban Guatemala.

The results with 45 families (230 individuals) suggested that the Contribution Rule was a better predictor of food distribution patterns in this setting than the Needs Rule. Specifically, male <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> households <b>received</b> a relatively higher proportion of the family's proteins, and the female <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> households <b>received</b> a relatively higher proportion of the family's calories, given their nutritional requirements, than other family members.
