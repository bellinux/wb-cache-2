40|$|Individual-level {{analysis}} Our user-friendly experimental interface {{makes it}} possible to present each subject with many choices {{in the course of a}} single experiment, yielding a rich individual-level dataset. We may therefore analyze behavior at the level of the individual subject, without the need to pool data or assume that subjects are homogenous. Furthermore, because choices are from standard budget sets, we are able to use classical revealed preference analysis to decide if subject behavior is consistent with rationality, and classical demand analysis to recover information about the underlying preferences. As a preview, we present in Attachment I scatterplots of all choices of each subject. To facilitate presentation of the data, the …gures are in color format. Each <b>entry</b> <b>plots</b> the token share o= (s + o) as a function of log(p) in both treatments. The …gures illustrate the striking regularity within subjects and heterogeneity across subjects that is characteristic of our data. Like FKM, we begin our individual-level analysis of the experimental data by testing fo...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} an {{analysis}} of the nature of chilling injury to seeds, measurements were made of the initial linear rates of water entry into and solute leakage out of cotyledons of soybean at various temperatures. Arrhenius plots were approximately linear for water entry into both living and dead cotyledons, with the slope (and activation energy) for entry into living cells being insignificantly higher than for dead cells, suggesting little effect of membrane barriers on water <b>entry.</b> The <b>plots</b> for solute leakage showed 10 -fold lower leakage rates from living than from dead tissues; a reversal of slope in the Arrhenius plot at temperatures below 15 C reflected increasing leakage rates, interpreted as a quantitative disruption of membrane reorganization at the temperatures associated with chilling injury...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermally}} developing laminar forced-convection {{flow and}} heat transfer characteristics in corrugated ducts confined by sinusoidal and arc curves, {{which are often}} encountered in honeycomb desiccant wheels, are numerically investigated via the boundary-fitted coordinate system. The control volume-based finite difference technique is applied to obtain the solution utilizing the numerically generated boundary-fitted coordinates. According to this method, the complex domain in the physical plane {{is transformed into a}} regular square domain in the computational plane. Studied and graphically illustrated are the effects of aspect ratios and bending ratios of the ducts on the friction coefficients and heat transfer coefficients under uniform wall temperature (T) boundary conditions. For the special cases of corrugated ducts such as circular, square, and flat sinusoidal, the results are compared with some findings in the literature, and very good agreement is obtained. Furthermore, variations of the bulk temperature, Nusselt numbers, velocity, and temperature profiles in the entire thermal <b>entry</b> region are <b>plotted.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

The experiment was {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design using a split plot arrangement and replicated three times. Organic fertilizer was the main <b>plot</b> and soybean <b>entries</b> sub <b>plot.</b> Data were collected on grain yield, yield attributes and quality (oil and protein contents) of the entries. Organic fertilizer application did not affect any of the agronomic traits evaluated, except number of seeds per plant. However, variety effect was significant (p< 0. 05) for all the traits, height to first pod and weight of seeds per plant. Fertilizer × Variety effect was not significant on nay trait. All the sixteen entries recorded grain yields (2092. 2 – 4076. 5 kg. ha- 1) which compared favorably well with world average (2250 kg. ha- 1).

40|$|Modern astronomical surveys produce large catalogs. Modern {{archives}} are web-based. As {{the science}} {{becomes more and}} more data driven, the pressure on visualization tools to support large datasets increases. While tables can render one page at a time, image overlays showing the returned catalog <b>entries</b> or XY <b>plots</b> showing the relationship between table columns must cover all of the rows to be meaningful. The large data set could easily overwhelm the browsers capabilities. Therefore the amount of data to be transported or rendered must be reduced. IRSA's catalog visualization is based on Firefly package, developed in IPAC (Roby 2013). Firefly is used by multiple web-based tools and archives, maintained by IRSA: Catalog Search, Spitzer, WISE, Plank, etc. Its distinctive feature is the tri-view: table, image overlay, and XY plot. All three highly interactive components are integrated together. The tri-view presentation allows an astronomer to dissect a dataset in various ways and to detect underlying structure and anomalies in the data, which makes it a handy tool for data exploration. Many challenges are encountered when only a subset of data is used in place of the full data set. Preserving coherence and maintaining the ability to select and filter data become issues. This talk addresses how we have solved problems in large dataset visualization...|$|R
40|$|The Urban Heat Island (UHI) {{effect can}} raise average {{temperatures}} around urban areas, {{especially those with}} a lot of impervious surfaces that act as heat sinks. The hypothesis explored here is that UHIs will have an effect on dates of leaf bud-break in red maples (Acer rubrum). The USA National Phenology Network (USANPN) brings together citizen scientists, researchers, educators, students, and anyone else with an interest in living organisms. These people record phenological data across the United States and add it to the USANPN’s database. We <b>plotted</b> <b>entries</b> for red maple from the database using GPS coordinates and grouped them into urban and rural categories at matching latitudes. We then compared the average date of leaf bud-break for each group of urban trees to the average leaf bud-break date for rural trees at the same latitude. The data {{for more than half of}} our samples went back 7 seasons, allowing our samples to not be skewed by an abnormally warm or cool spring. If the hypothesis is valid, the data will show significantly earlier leaf bud-break dates for the urban red maples than for the rural red maples. This would demonstrate that urban environment can influence the phenology of red maples. Some UHIs could be strong enough to change hardiness zones and allow for certain species of trees to be grown at colder latitudes than nature would allow without human intervention...|$|R

Patrick Macias from The Japan Times comments [...] "while Clements and McCarthy's mastery of Japanese culture, both high and low, is impressive, the authors sometimes stumble {{when they try to}} step outside their fields of expertise". Valerie MacEwan commends the book saying, [...] "only the most ardent aficionado of anime would find this volume lacking in detail. is easy to use, fully indexed and cross-referenced with titles in Japanese and English". Sarah of Anime UK News criticises the book saying that Clement's and McCarthy's [...] "descriptions can betray personal preferences which may not coincide with the reader's".|$|R
40|$|International audienceQuantification and {{characterization}} of hydrological and sedimentary transfers are now major challenges to preserving European soils and water resources (Law on Water, Water Framework Directive). In northwestern France, stream water quality is currently reduced by suspended sediment. However, in these low-energy water systems, sediment origin and dynamics into the catchment remain difficult to analyze {{from a local}} to a regional scale because of intermediary traps caused by landscape structure (hedgerow areas) and land use organization on the slopes. To provide {{a better understanding of}} sediment dynamics in these systems we proposed to analyze runoff dynamics on slopes and to assess slopes' contribution to the sediment budget of a catchment. This study is based on sediment connectivity analysis, used to accurately determine runoff dynamics between producing areas and the outlet of the catchment. This work is focused on the Lingèvres catchment (15 [*]km 2), a typical feature of the low-energy water system located {{in the western part of}} France, in between open-field and bocage landscapes. The results demonstrate that in a hedgerow landscape, known for its protective role against runoff connection to the river, sediment delivery from slopes is more important and efficient than in an open-field area where no obstacles are observed. This is explained by diverse drainage densities and spatial organization of roads, and ditch and <b>plot</b> <b>entries</b> which induced differentiated sediment delivery from agricultural plots and the river. However, they also underlined the weakness of sediment delivery from slopes compared with sediment fluxes exported from the catchment. Conversely, they highlight the fundamental role of erosion processes due to agricultural practices and landscape organization in headwater systems, which seem to be the main functional area at the sub-catchment scale...|$|R

In {{the study of the}} recovering of the wet tropical forest of the Osa Peninsula, were used data bases coming from the measurements done in the PPS, for trhee years: 1990 (forest without intevention), 2007 (15 years after the harverst) and 2011 (19 years after the haverst). The analisis of the recovering of the forest, was done based on the behavior of the horizontal structure, commercial groups, ecologycal unions, mortality, recruitmen and exchange rates, biologycal biodiversty, growth, conservation status and behavior of the forest 15 years after the intervention. There were no found statistical diferences between the number of individuals and the basal area per hectare, individuals and the basal area per commercial group and ecologycal union shown in the 1990 (primary forest) and the 19 years after the use, or between the management systems. Which is evidence of recovering on these areas after 19 years from the intervention. Was determined that the minimal reference value for the basal area established by the present Forestry Law should be rise for the disturbed forest in Osa Peninsula.
