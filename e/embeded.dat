No matter how his poetics belongs to ‘this’ time, it belongs to ‘that’ time, as well. To such extent is his drama work <b>embeded</b> in traditional loom. Peculiar, to that point unknown and painted with strong mentality features, characters meet the modern man with original language, incredible idiomatics. The value od Uskoković’s drama is not in outer fable, but in inner world and the language of its protagonists. In fact, what are his personae dramatis like? What is the quality they have in common? Maybe it’s the unexpected—they are all made of loneliness. It will appear that what is urban will become the doom of collective experience, that it has immense difficulties achieving identity, as if the meaning and purpose of individual life faces with utopia wich won’t accept personality degradation and it’s inefficacy.
