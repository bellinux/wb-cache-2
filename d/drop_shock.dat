5|$|Marvel {{announced}} at the 2009 Comic Con that two new comics, a five-part series written by Peter David and a second series written by Fred Van Lente, would appear the coming summer and winter. David's series, Halo: Helljumper, is set prior to Halo: Combat Evolved and focuses on the elite Orbital <b>Drop</b> <b>Shock</b> Troopers. The five-part series was published between July and November 2009. Lente's series, originally titled Spartan Black, revolves around a black ops team of Spartan supersoldiers assigned to the UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence. The rebranded comic, Halo: Blood Line, debuted in December 2009. A comic-retelling of the novel Halo: The Fall of Reach was the most recent comic series entitled: Halo: Fall of Reach. Fall of Reach was split into three mini-stories: Boot Camp, Covenant, and Invasion. Two new series were announced in 2013. A three-part series, Halo: Initiation was released August 2013 with Brian Reed returning as writer. Also announced was Halo: Escalation, an ongoing comic series covering the period directly after Halo 4.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, Ren-He’s {{method for}} {{nonlinear}} oscillators is adopted to give approximate {{solutions for the}} <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> response of cubic and cubic-quintic nonlinear equations arising from packaging system. In order to improve {{the accuracy of the}} solutions, a novel technique combining Ren-He’s method with the energy method is proposed, the maximum values of the displacement response and acceleration response of the system are obtained by the energy method, and the approximate solution is corrected. An analytical expression of the important parameters including the maximum displacement, the maximum acceleration of <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> response and the <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> duration is obtained. The illustrative examples show that the <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> response obtained by this method is very similar to the one by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The result provides a new simple and effective method for the <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> response of a nonlinear packaging system.|$|R

The influence of suspension angle on peaks of response were discussed. It shows that the maximum response nondimensional acceleration decreases with decrease of the suspension angle under condition of the same nondimensional <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> velocity. Conditions for resonance were obtained by applying the variational iteration method, which should be avoided in the packaging design.

40|$|Dimensionless <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> dynamic {{equations}} of suspension nonlinear packaging {{system with}} critical components were obtained. The numerical results of shock response were gained using Runge-Kutta method. To evaluate the <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> characteristics of critical components, the dropping damage boundary curve was established, where the system parameter and the dimensionless shock velocity were selected as two coordinate parameters. Then, the frequency ratio {{and the system}} damping ratio were taken as third basic parameters of the dropping damage boundary surface, respectively. To study dynamic properties of the suspension system with critical components, the shock response acceleration, shock response displacements, and dropping damage boundary were analyzed. Based on the numerical results, {{the effects of the}} relevant parameters on <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> response and damage boundary of critical component were investigated. It is demonstrated that both a higher frequency ratio and a system damping ratio in the specific range can exert a positive effect on the product protection and should be selected in design process of the suspension system.

500|$|The Life, {{also known}} as We Are ODST is a {{television}} and cinema advertisement launched in 2009 by Microsoft to promote the first person shooter [...] in the United States. The 150-second piece follows a young soldier through enlistment, training, and battle as an Orbital <b>Drop</b> <b>Shock</b> Trooper (ODST), analogous to a paratrooper that drops from space to a battlefield. The Life was created by advertising agency T.A.G., an offshoot of McCann Erickson. Production of the commercial itself was handled by production company Morton/Jankel/Zander (MJZ). It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum. It was filmed in Hungary, just outside Budapest in a coal mine and abandoned factories to give the sequence an [...] "Eastern Bloc" [...] aesthetic. The commercial and its associated campaign, proved hugely successful; on the week of its launch, Halo 3: ODST became the top-selling game for the Xbox 360 worldwide, and over 2.5 million copies were sold within {{the first few weeks}} of release.

500|$|Halo 3: ODST is {{a shooter}} video game with most {{gameplay}} taking place from a first-person perspective. The game features an open world {{environment in the}} updated Kenyan city of Mombasa, referred to as New Mombasa. Although the gameplay of ODST bears a strong resemblance to that of previous Halo titles, the player does not {{assume the role of}} the enhanced human supersoldier Master Chief, protagonist of Halo 3. Instead, the player controls human soldiers known as [...] "Orbital <b>Drop</b> <b>Shock</b> Troopers" [...] or ODSTs. Since ODSTs do not possess the Master Chief's advanced armor and reflexes, they cannot jump as high, move as fast, survive large falls, or wield two weapons at once. Instead of the Master Chief's damage-absorbing energy shield, the game uses a recharging stamina mechanic. After the player sustains damage, the screen flashes red and the stamina score decreases. If the player receives additional damage before the stamina can recover, the player's health is reduced. Loss of all health causes the player character to die and restart at the last saved checkpoint. Medical packs scattered around the game environment can restore the player's health. The player's head-up display (HUD) includes a [...] "VISR" [...] mode that outlines enemies in red, allies in green, and items of interest in either blue or yellow.|$|E

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the dropping impact dynamics, the maximum displacement, the maximum acceleration of the system response, and the <b>dropping</b> <b>shock</b> duration is in focus as regards the important parameters. Ren-He’s method has been successfully used for the cubic and cubic-quintic nonlinear equations arising from a packaging system; the analytical solutions of the system are obtained, the analytic expression of the above three important parameters is obtained at the same time. In order to further improve {{the accuracy of the}} solution, a new method combining the RHM with the energy method, which is defined as a correction method of the RHM (denoted CRHM), is proposed and successfully used to study the cubic and the cubic-quintic nonlinear packaging system. The numerical examples indicate that the lowest order analytical solution obtained by the CRHM has higher accuracy, which outperforms a similar analytical method. The CRHM is obviously advantageous in that it is simple and it can avoid solving the complicated nonlinear algebraic equation.
