5|$|His origins are unknown, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not {{a native}} Englishman. He {{may have been}} German or Norman. The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|Hygeberht (died after 803) was the Bishop of Lichfield from 779 and Archbishop of Lichfield {{after the}} {{elevation}} of Lichfield to an archdiocese some time after 787, {{during the reign of}} the powerful Mercian king Offa.

5|$|Ono {{asked the}} {{hospital}} not {{to report to}} the media that her husband was dead until she had informed their five-year-old son Sean, who was at home.

5|$|Sahure is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important kings of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, his reign being a political and cultural high point of the 5th Dynasty. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the son of his predecessor Userkaf with queen Neferhetepes II, and was in turn succeeded by his son Neferirkare Kakai.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} army {{received}} sufficient recruits, Diocletian {{appears to have}} instituted systematic annual conscription of Roman citizens {{for the first time}} since the days of the Roman Republic.

5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E
5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} that proves this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a {{monographic}} study of beans, lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names. In doing this <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> laying {{the ground for}} the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E

5|$|Godwin's wife, and {{the mother}} of his {{children}} including Harold and Edith, was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir. Her father was Thorgils Sprakaleg, a Dane whose origin is unknown, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a Dane from Scania, which was then in Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gytha was very well connected as her brother Ulf married King Cnut's sister Estrith. Cnut probably arranged the marriage between Godwin and Gytha in about 1022.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, a British {{expeditionary force}} invaded Buenos Aires. A 13-year-old Rosas served distributing {{ammunition}} to troops in a force organised by Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{to counter the}} invasion. The British were defeated in August 1806, but returned a year later. Rosas was then assigned to the Caballería de los Migueletes (a militia cavalry), although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> barred from active duty during this time due to illness.|$|E
5|$|James Sloan Kuykendall {{was born}} on December 9, 1878, in the Springfield Magisterial District of Hampshire County, West Virginia. He was the eldest child and son of William Kuykendall and his wife Hannah Pierce Sloan Kuykendall. Kuykendall's family was of Dutch descent {{and was one of}} the oldest {{families}} residing in Hampshire County. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> named for his maternal grandfather, James Sloan. Kuykendall had two younger brothers and one younger sister: Michael Blue Kuykendall, Richard Sloan Kuykendall, and Nellie Frank Kuykendall. For the first 20 years of his life, Kuykendall resided on his family's farm, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits.|$|E

5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William Bruce's youth, and his date of birth is unrecorded. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> born at Blairhall in western Fife, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. He may have {{attended}} St Andrews University in 1637–1638, which would suggest that his birth date was as early as 1625. The Bruces were a well-connected Episcopalian family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from Thomas Bruce a cousin of King Robert II, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife. Bruce's first cousin Edward Bruce was created Earl of Kincardine in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo {{returned}} to Venice in 1295 with his fortune converted into gemstones. At this time, Venice was {{at war with}} the Republic of Genoa. Polo armed a galley equipped with a trebuchet to join the war. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> caught by Genoans in a skirmish in 1296, off the Anatolian coast between Adana and the Gulf of Alexandretta and not during the battle of Curzola (September 1298), off the Dalmatian coast. The latter claim is due to a later tradition (16th Century) recorded by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E

5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These aspects of his life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus was a monk from Rome {{sent to the}} Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, {{along with}} Mellitus and others, {{as part of the}} second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further {{activities}} until he went to Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall mac Somairle (also {{known in}} Gaelic as Raghnall, Raonall, Raonull; in English as Ranald, Reginald; in Latin as Reginaldus; and in Old Norse as Rögnvaldr, Røgnvaldr, Rǫgnvaldr; died 1191/1192/1227) was a {{significant}} late twelfth century magnate, seated on the western seaboard of Scotland. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a younger son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll and his wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. The twelfth-century Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by Ragnall's father and maternal-grandfather, existed within a hybrid Norse-Gaelic milieu, which bordered an ever strengthening and consolidating Kingdom of Scots.|$|E
