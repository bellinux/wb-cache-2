5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would <b>drive</b> <b>stakes</b> into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|R

50|$|Stephanie's Kitten ended her racing {{career in}} the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf at Keeneland on 31 October. The Irish filly Legatissimo was made the odds-on {{favorite}} ahead of the Chilean champion Dacita with Stephanie's Kitten third in the betting on 7.8/1. The other runners were Miss France, Queen's Jewel (Prix Saint-Alary), Secret Gesture, Watsdachances, Sentiero Italia (Sands Point Stakes), Photo Call (Rodeo <b>Drive</b> <b>Stakes)</b> and Sharla Rae (Del Mar Oaks). Stephanie's Kitten was restrained by Ortiz {{at the rear of}} the field as Secret Gesture set the pace. She began to make progress on the inside approaching the final turn and continued her charge in the straight, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Legatissimo.|$|R

50|$|The plan Stephano, Trinculo and (mostly) Caliban {{formulate}} is to {{wait for}} Prospero to take his afternoon sleep, then steal his magic books so he cannot fight back.

5000|$|A federal decree in 1834 {{that defined}} lands {{west of the}} Missouri [...] "Indian Territory" [...] {{prevented}} settlement by Americans for another 20 years. In 1846 Mormon settlers received permission from the Omaha tribe to establish their Winter Quarters near the Missouri River west of Kanesville, Iowa, and in 1848 Martin Van Buren's Free Soil Party advocated the federal government give away free land in the presidential election. By 1853, Kanesville townspeople had already <b>driven</b> <b>stakes</b> in the land that would become Omaha. Logan Fontenelle, along with six other leaders of the Omaha tribe, signed over rights to Omaha lands on March 16, 1854, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act was signed on May 30, 1854. On June 24 of that year the U.S. government announced the treaty with the Omaha tribe, and within 11 days, on July 4, Omaha City was formally founded.|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{missions}} [...] were considered temporary ventures by the Spanish hierarchy, {{the development of}} an individual settlement was {{not simply a matter of}} [...] "priestly whim." [...] The founding of a mission followed longstanding rules and procedures; the paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the bureaucracy. Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, plenty of wood for fires and building material, and ample fields for grazing herds and raising crops. The padres blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs or <b>driven</b> <b>stakes,</b> roofed with thatch or reeds. It was these simple huts that would ultimately give way to the stone and adobe buildings which exist to this day.|$|R
5000|$|Klein {{received}} extensive {{criticism for}} his 2005 biography of Hillary Clinton, The Truth About Hillary. Politico criticized {{the book for}} [...] "serious factual errors, truncated and distorted quotes and overall themes that don't gibe with any other serious accounts of Clinton's life." [...] The conservative columnist John Podhoretz criticized the book in the New York Post, [...] "Thirty pages into it, I {{wanted to take a}} shower. Sixty pages into it, I wanted to be decontaminated. And 200 pages into it, I wanted someone to <b>drive</b> <b>stakes</b> through my eyes so I wouldn't have to suffer through another word." [...] In the National Review, conservative columnist James Geraghty wrote, “Folks, there are plenty of arguments against Hillary Clinton, her policies, her views, her proposals, and her philosophies. This stuff ain’t it. Nobody on the right, left, or center ought to stoop to this level.” ...|$|R
40|$|The world {{tends to}} trust mathematicians and their numbers. By extension, the numbers {{generated}} by polls and surveys command much respect, sometimes beyond their deserved due. Thus, when an especially juicy statistic enters the public consciousness, {{it can take}} {{on a life of}} its own, long after new data superseded the old survey and should have <b>driven</b> a <b>stake</b> through its heart...|$|R
5000|$|A man's body {{wrapped in}} a shroud is shoved into a Transylvania grave in 1874. An executioner (Milton Reid) <b>drives</b> a <b>stake</b> through its heart. Immediately afterward, Carl (Vincent Maddern), who is {{severely}} physically disabled, emerges from hiding and kills the gravedigger (Otto Diamant). Carl summons a drunken doctor (Cameron Hall) to perform a heart transplant on the body, then murders the doctor.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Work Song" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the Nat Adderley composition) should reflect the history of the black workers in the US, with elements of the soul jazz. This is the only truly representative composition in the album. It is actually a jazz tone poem depicting the old slave gangs as they did their back-brakeing work of [...] "swinging that hammer". <b>Driving</b> <b>stakes</b> or laying railroad ties with all the oppression and problems the Black race had at that time. Notice the cannon-like sound of the piano which really simulates the blow of a sledge-hammer. This called a [...] "cluster" [...] on the piano. Because of the low register clusters and other rhythm section accents, we get a strong feeling of depression throughout the piece. However, there is a note of hope in the composition which is found in the words of the original melody: [...] "Swing that hammer over your shoulder: get bolder and - BOLDER!" ...|$|R

50|$|A {{particular}} {{use of the}} maul was by archers in the 15th and 16th centuries. At the Battle of Agincourt, English longbowmen {{are recorded}} as using lead mauls, initially {{as a tool to}} <b>drive</b> in <b>stakes</b> but later as improvised weapons. Other references during the century (for example, in Charles the Bold's 1472 Ordinance) suggest continued use. They are recorded as a weapon of Tudor archers as late as 1562.|$|R
