25|$|<b>Insulating</b> <b>glass</b> is an {{evolution}} from older technologies known as double-hung windows and storm windows. Traditional double-hung windows used a single {{pane of glass}} to separate the interior and exterior spaces.|$|E
25|$|Other glazing {{material}} variations affect acoustics. The {{most widely}} used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.|$|E
500|$|The {{ice block}} {{expedition}} of 1959 (...) was {{a publicity stunt}} {{carried out by the}} Norwegian insulation material producer Glassvatt (today called Glava AS). Responding to a challenge from the radio station Radio Luxembourg, Glassvatt decided to equip a truck to bring a three-ton block of ice from Mo i Rana by the Arctic Circle, to Libreville by the Equator. There was no form of refrigeration applied, and the expedition was intended to display the efficiency of the <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> wool used. The truck also brought 300kg of medicines to the hospital of Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné.|$|E

5000|$|When {{this home}} was built, <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> {{was not as}} common {{as it is today}} - {{especially}} for windows as large as 8½ by 10 feet - and so all the glazing in the house is 1/4" [...] plate glass, with an R-value of 1. Replacing it all with <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> to save energy would have a payback period several times the warranty for the new glazing - which has a perimeter seal between its two or more panes, subject to eventual failure. The original glass, which has no such failure mode, remains clear after 50 years.|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} advanced, <b>insulated</b> <b>glass,</b> vinyl and vinyl-wood composite framework appeared.

2500|$|<b>Insulating</b> <b>glass</b> (IG), more {{commonly}} known as double glazing (or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists {{of two or three}} glass window panes separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope.|$|E
2500|$|The {{glass panes}} are {{separated}} by a [...] "spacer". A spacer, {{also known as a}} warm edge, [...] is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> system, and seals the gas space between them. Historically, spacers were made primarily of metal and fiber, which manufacturers thought provided more durability.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Insulating</b> <b>glass</b> units (IGUs) are {{manufactured}} with glass in range of thickness from 3 to 10mm (1/8" [...] to 3/8") {{or more in}} special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may {{also be used as}} part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation orsecurity may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.|$|E

2500|$|One Canada Square has 3,960 {{windows and}} was one of the first {{buildings}} to incorporate metallicised windows and other advanced window technologies, to assist with the building's energy efficiency plans. [...] The tower uses super-insulated windows at triple-pane glazing (with a high solar heat-gain coefficient), low-emissivity (low-e) coatings to prevent heat loss in winter months, UV coatings, scratch resistant outer layers, sealed argon / krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, 'warm edge' <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> spacers, air-seals and specially developed thermally designed window frames. [...] The windows were manufactured with ehigh R-values [...] for the time, thereby the thermal resistance is one of the highest rated in the world for the entire window including the frame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{buildings}} are recognized by their 231 glass spires, {{with the largest}} one [...] tall. Also notable are the surfaces of reflective <b>insulating</b> <b>glass,</b> that served to advertise the project's founder. The buildings contain over one {{million square feet of}} PPG's Solarban 550 Twindow - 19,750 pieces. The primary building, One PPG Place, is a 40-story tower, with PPG Industries occupying half of the space. The complex also contains a 14-story building, and four 6-story structures. PPG Industries also uses space in one of the other buildings. The lobby of One PPG is a -high entrance that features red glass. The building has 21 elevators, each with walls constructed of clear glass panels enclosing fractured glass. In total, the complex cost $200 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} UK conservatories {{came to a}} halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using <b>insulated</b> <b>glass.</b> In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter. Technologies include argon-impregnated glass, heat reflective film, thermal ribbons or thermal breaks - hollow sections of glass that intercept heat.|$|R

50|$|By far {{the most}} common glazing type, glass can be of an almost {{infinite}} combination of color, thickness, and opacity.For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Presently, 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> {{is used for the}} rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton may be used to offer better thermal transmittance values. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios.|$|E
