Key Findings: 39. 2 % of all client households of the emergency food programs <b>had</b> <b>low</b> food security. Another 36. 3 % <b>had</b> very <b>low</b> food security.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – are more likely to <b>have</b> <b>low</b> back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to <b>have</b> <b>low</b> back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E

They should not be confused with low-luminosity objects at the low-mass end of the main sequence, such as the hydrogen-fusing red dwarfs, whose cores are supported in part by thermal pressure, or the even lower-temperature brown dwarfs.|$|E
40|$|Protein C {{and protein}} S pathway {{activity}} were measured in 30 Saudi females suffering from pre-eclampsia, 30 healthy Saudi pregnant women acting as controls, and 30 healthy Saudi non pregnant women also acting as normal controls. 40 % of the Saudi pregnant women suffering from pre-eclampsia had abnormal protein C activity. Among the healthy individuals acting as control, 3. 3 % {{of pregnant women}} and none of non pregnant women <b>had</b> <b>low</b> protein C pathway activity. All the pregnant women either pregnant with preeclampsia or normal pregnant women <b>had</b> <b>low</b> values of free protein S, whereas 36 % of non pregnant controls <b>had</b> <b>low</b> values. For total protein S 93. 3 % of Saudi pregnant women suffering from pre-eclampsia <b>had</b> <b>low</b> total protein S, 80 % of normal pregnant controls <b>had</b> <b>low</b> values, and 36. 6 % of non pregnant women controls <b>had</b> <b>low</b> values of total protein S pathway activity. On the other hand, fibrinogen was high in all Saudi pregnant women suffering from preeclampsia, 86. 6 % of pregnant women had high values of fibrinogen, and 50 % of non pregnant women had high fibrinogen values. In the light of above findings, protein S screening is recommended during pregnancy to exclude pre-eclampsia and care should be taken with decreased levels of protein S activity to avoid thrombosis...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either <b>have</b> <b>low</b> levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to <b>have</b> <b>low</b> collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or <b>have</b> <b>low</b> radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.|$|E

5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore <b>have</b> <b>low</b> metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates <b>have</b> <b>low</b> {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar {{to table}} salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), <b>have</b> <b>low</b> elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do <b>have</b> <b>low</b> fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims <b>have</b> <b>low</b> credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Lithium fluoride, when {{highly enriched}} in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic {{constituent}} of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors.
