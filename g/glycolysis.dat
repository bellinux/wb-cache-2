5|$|In <b>glycolysis,</b> glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. <b>Glycolysis</b> generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of <b>glycolysis</b> is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is <b>glycolysis,</b> where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) <b>glycolysis</b> and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, <b>glycolysis</b> produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in <b>glycolysis.</b> An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of <b>glycolysis,</b> a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of <b>glycolysis,</b> forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of <b>glycolysis</b> is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; <b>glycolysis</b> is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} {{can be converted}} into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with <b>glycolysis.</b> However, this pathway is not simply <b>glycolysis</b> run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.|$|E
5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as <b>glycolysis</b> and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as <b>glycolysis</b> and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of <b>glycolysis</b> can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in <b>glycolysis,</b> while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups of}} archaea use {{sunlight}} {{as a source}} of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of <b>glycolysis</b> (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{citric acid}} cycle is {{regulated}} mainly by {{the availability of}} key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. Citrate– the molecule that gives {{its name to the}} cycle– is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The endosymbiotic {{relationship}} of mitochondria with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria descended from bacteria that somehow survived endocytosis by another cell, and became {{incorporated into the}} cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on <b>glycolysis</b> and fermentation would have provided a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7 to 2 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (<b>glycolysis).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the <b>glycolysis</b> pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic <b>glycolysis</b> of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in <b>glycolysis,</b> the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} <b>glycolysis</b> are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. <b>Glycolysis</b> produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes. For instance, in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol. The most complete data are available in yeast, where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major metabolic pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, <b>glycolysis</b> and gluconeogenesis. The localization of pathways can be different in other organisms, for instance fatty acid synthesis occurs in chloroplasts in plants to functional genomics |journal=Biochem. Soc. Trans. |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=567–73 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11171129 |doi=10.1042/BST0280567}} and in apicoplasts in apicomplexa.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering <b>glycolysis</b> or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and <b>glycolysis,</b> and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters <b>glycolysis</b> and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from <b>glycolysis</b> and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E
5|$|In <b>glycolysis,</b> {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E
5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as <b>glycolysis,</b> the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic <b>glycolysis</b> to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by <b>glycolysis.</b> Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{reactions}} catalyzed by oxidoreductases {{are vital}} {{in all parts}} of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, <b>glycolysis,</b> and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycolysis</b> is {{an oxygen}} {{independent}} metabolic pathway, {{meaning that it}} does not use molecular oxygen (i.e. atmospheric oxygen) for any of its reactions. However the products of <b>glycolysis</b> (pyruvate and NADH + H+) are sometimes metabolized using atmospheric oxygen. When molecular oxygen is used for the metabolism of the products of <b>glycolysis</b> the process is usually referred to as aerobic, whereas if no oxygen is used the process is said to be anaerobic. Thus, <b>glycolysis</b> occurs, with variations, in nearly all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of <b>glycolysis</b> indicates that {{it is one of the}} most ancient metabolic pathways. Indeed, the reactions that constitute <b>glycolysis</b> and its parallel pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, occur metal-catalyzed under the oxygen-free conditions of the Archean oceans, also in the absence of enzymes. <b>Glycolysis</b> could thus have originated from chemical constraints of the prebiotic world.|$|E
25|$|If <b>glycolysis</b> were to {{continue}} indefinitely, {{all of the}} NAD+ would be used up, and <b>glycolysis</b> would stop. To allow <b>glycolysis</b> {{to continue}}, organisms {{must be able to}} oxidize NADH back to NAD+. How this is performed depends on which external electron acceptor is available.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{performing}} {{aerobic respiration}} synthesize much more ATP, {{but not as}} part of <b>glycolysis.</b> These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H+ from <b>glycolysis.</b> Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however {{most of these are}} produced by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level phosphorylation in <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycolysis</b> {{occurs in}} most organisms in the cytosol of the cell. The {{most common type}} of <b>glycolysis</b> is the EmbdenMeyerhofParnas (EMP pathway), which was {{discovered}} by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas. <b>Glycolysis</b> also refers to other pathways, such as the Entner–Doudoroff pathway and various heterofermentative and homofermentative pathways. However, the discussion here will be limited to the EmbdenMeyerhofParnas pathway.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, vigorously {{contracting}} skeletal muscles (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do {{not receive}} enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism, converting glucose to lactate. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of <b>glycolysis,</b> and actually requires three {{times the amount of}} energy gained from <b>glycolysis</b> (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in <b>glycolysis).</b> Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo <b>glycolysis</b> in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of <b>glycolysis</b> during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the Cori cycle.|$|E
25|$|This high <b>glycolysis</b> {{rate has}} {{important}} medical applications, as high aerobic <b>glycolysis</b> by malignant tumors is utilized clinically to diagnose and monitor treatment responses of cancers by imaging uptake of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) (a radioactive modified hexokinase substrate) with {{positron emission tomography}} (PET).|$|E
25|$|High {{concentrations}} of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst {{of one of}} the rate-limiting steps of <b>glycolysis.</b> This effect is advantageous: high {{concentrations of}} citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so {{there is no need for}} phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into <b>glycolysis.</b> Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, another sign that there is no need to carry out <b>glycolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Malignant Tumor cells perform <b>glycolysis</b> at a {{rate that}} is ten times faster than their noncancerous tissue counterparts. During their genesis, limited {{capillary}} support often results in hypoxia (decreased O2 supply) within the tumor cells. Thus, these cells rely on anaerobic metabolic processes such as <b>glycolysis</b> for ATP. Some tumor cells overexpress specific glycolytic enzymes which results in higher rates of <b>glycolysis.</b> Often these enzymes are Isoenzymes, of traditional <b>glycolysis</b> enzymes, that vary in their susceptibility to traditional feedback inhibition. The increase in glycolytic activity ultimately counteracts the effects of hypoxia by generating sufficient ATP from this anaerobic pathway. This phenomenon was first described in 1930 by Otto Warburg and {{is referred to as the}} Warburg effect. The Warburg hypothesis claims that cancer is primarily caused by dysfunctionality in mitochondrial metabolism, rather than because of uncontrolled growth of cells.|$|E
