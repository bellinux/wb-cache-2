5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque,</b> the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E

40|$|Whether animals ever {{exhibit a}} {{preference}} for same-sex sexual partners is a subject of debate. <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> represent excellent models for examining issues related to sexual preference in animals be-cause females, in certain populations, routinely engage in both heterosexual and homosexual behavior {{over the course of}} their life spans. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that female homosexual behavior in <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> is a sexual behavior, not a sociosexual one. Additional evidence indicates that female <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> do not engage in homosexual behavior simply because acceptable male mates are unavailable or unmotivated to copulate. Patterns of sexual partner choice by female <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> that are the focus of intersexual competition indicate that females of this species choose same-sex sexual partners even when they are simultaneously presented with a motivated, opposite-sex alternative. Thus, in some populations of <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques,</b> females prefer certain same-sex sexual partners relative to certain male mates, and vice versa. Taken together, this evidence suggests that female <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> are best characterized as bisexual in orientation, not preferentially homosexual or preferentially heterosexual. KEY WORDS: homosexual behavior; sexual preference; <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques.</b> Most researchers would agree that same-sex interac-tions involving genital contact are widespread among an-imals and can occur independent of any hormonal or neu-rological manipulations (Adkins-Regan, 1988; Bagemihl...|$|R

Contrary to the predictions of the reconciliation hypothesis, homosexual interactions between female <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> did not peak during postconflict periods, as compared to matched control periods preceding the conflicts. In fact, aggressive interactions appeared to inhibit, rather than facilitate, the expression of homosexual behavior among subordinate consort partners.

25|$|Although SDN is much {{related to}} sexual partner {{preferences}} in males, {{it does not}} show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite {{for the expression of}} male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque,</b> which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. The part of the brain examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque)</b> shows that there is {{no significant difference between the}} volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> {{lives in}} a variety of habitats. It inhabits {{subtropical}} forests {{in the southern part of}} its range and subarctic forests in mountainous areas in the northern part of its range. It can be found in both warm and cool forests, such as the deciduous forests of central and northern Japan and the broadleaf evergreen forests in the southwest of the islands. Warm temperate evergreen and broadleaf forests and the cool temperate deciduous broadleaf forests are the most important habitats for macaques.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn {{to early}} winter, macaques feed in between {{different}} activities. In the winter, macaques have {{two to four}} feeding bouts each day with fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they {{have two or three}} bouts of feeding daily. In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities. Macaques usually sleep in trees, but also sleep on the ground, as well as on or near rocks and fallen trees. During the winter, macaques huddle together for warmth in sleeping grounds. Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> is {{omnivorous}} {{and eats}} {{a variety of}} foods. Over 213 species of plants are included on the macaque's diet. It also eats insects, bark, and soil. On Yakushima Island, fruit, mature leaves, and fallen seeds are primarily eaten. The macaque also eats fungi, ferns, invertebrates, {{and other parts of}} plants. In addition, on Yakushima, their diets vary seasonally with fruits being eaten in the summer and herbs being eaten in the winter. Further north, macaques mostly eat foods such as fruit and nuts to store fat for the winter, when food is scarce. On the northern island of Kinkazan, macaques mostly eat fallen seeds, herbs, young leaves, and fruits. When preferred food items are not available, macaques dig up underground plant parts (roots or rhizomes) or eat soil and fish.|$|E
500|$|All higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share {{two major}} adaptations for {{care of the}} young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care. They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a {{prolonged}} period of time. Many mammals are K-selectors, and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selectors. When two animals mate, they both share {{an interest in the}} success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females, both r- and K-selectors, exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may [...] "aunt" [...] the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males {{may play a role in}} child rearing, as with tenrecs, however this varies species to species, even within the same genus.

[...] The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> is a feature of several fairy tales, such as the tale of Momotaro and the fable about The Crab and the Monkey. [...] As the monkey is part of the Chinese zodiac, which has been used for centuries in Japan, the creature was sometimes portrayed in paintings of the Edo Period as a tangible metaphor for a particular year.

40|$|The intraerythrocytic {{stage of}} the simian malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium coatneyi (CDC strain) was intravenously inoculated into two species of macaques with different susceptibilities to infection with this parasite, including four <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> (Macaca fuscata) and three cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis). The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> infected with P. coatneyi developed severe clinical manifestations {{similar to those of}} severe human malaria and eventually became moribund, while the infected cynomolgus macaques, natural hosts of the parasite, exhibited no severe manifestation of disease except anemia and finally recovered from the infection. In the infected <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques,</b> peripheral CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell populations were markedly decreased and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected during the terminal period of infection, suggesting that apoptotic cell death was responsible at least in part for the T lymphocytopenia. Furthermore, soluble Fas ligand levels in sera of the infected <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> increased gradually to a markedly high level of 28. 83 ± 10. 56 pg/ml (n = 4) when the animals became moribund. On the other hand, none of the infected cynomolgus monkeys exhibited either T lymphocytopenia or elevated soluble Fas ligand level. These findings suggest that differences in immune response between the two species of macaque tested accounted for the contrasting outcomes after infection with the same isolate of malarial parasite, and in particular that a profound T lymphocytopenia due to Fas-derived apoptosis {{played a role in the}} fatal course of malaria in the infected <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> {{is a very}} {{intelligent}} species. Researchers studying this species at Koshima Island in Japan left sweet potatoes out on the beach for them to eat, then witnessed one female, named Imo (Japanese for yam or potato), washing the food off with river water rather than brushing it off as the others were doing, and later even dipping her clean food into salty sea water. After a while, others started to copy her behavior. This trait was then passed on from generation to generation, until eventually all except the oldest members of the troop were washing their food and even seasoning it in the sea. She was similarly the first observed balling up wheat with air pockets, throwing it into the water, and {{waiting for it to}} float back up before picking it up and eating it free from soil. An altered misaccount of this incident is the basis for the [...] "hundredth monkey" [...] effect.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{emulation}} {{learning are}} well documented among primates. [...] Notable examples include <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaque</b> potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior {{was observed in}} her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over {{the next two years}} seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, {{and by the end of}} the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice. Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own. Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food. Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} two non-conceptive sexual behavioral patterns (female-male mounting – FMM – and female-female mounting – FFM) across four free-ranging {{groups of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> (Macaca fuscata) living at three different field sites in Japan (Arashiyama, Minoo, and Jigokudani). We found marked inter-group differences and covariation {{in the frequency}} and form of FMM and FFM. This result supports the view that FMM and FFM in <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> are developmentally and evolutionarily linked. The customary occurrence, high prevalence, and great diversity of FMM and FFM at Arashiyama {{may be the result}} of combined favorable socio-demographic conditions, namely few resident males, most of them being old, sexually under-motivated, and less aggressive and controlling than the average male <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques.</b> We suggest that FMM and FFM may be cultural sexual practices in the Arashiyama-E group. In most other populations, all the aforementioned favorable socio-demographic conditions are not met, and although female mounting may occasionally be expressed by several group members, it does not reach the group-level tradition status. Our cultural interpretation of female mounting in <b>Japanese</b> <b>macaques</b> is consistent with evidence of the social transmission of courtship behaviors and mating preferences in various animal taxa, including nonhuman primates and humans. Our study may have implications for the evolution of non-conceptive sexuality in humans, including sexual fluidity in women...|$|R
