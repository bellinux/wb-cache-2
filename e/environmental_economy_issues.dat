In recent decades both the role and perception of urban forests have changed regarding rec-reational and environmental aspects on both a local and global level. This coupled with urbanization places great importance on how people see and value the forests in an urban and peri-urban setting. Visitors are not a homo-geneous category and hence have different needs and perceptions of urban and peri-urban green spaces. The study aims to understand the visitors ` perception from municipality Aerodrom towards urban forests and their recreational use, benefits, preferences and perception re...|$|R

By reviewing previous relevant work, the airport is divided into five activity areas (operations, <b>economy,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues,</b> safety and security, costumer service), and for each area an initial set of indicators is selected. These indicators are then ranked by airport managers in Sweden and Spain, using a questionnaire based survey. Using the ranking as a base, a final set of indicators is constructed with the aim that is should be manageable, easy to interpret and useful for analyzing the entire airport...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith {{the rapidly}} {{development}} of world <b>economy,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> {{has become more}} and more prominent, so environmental protection has become a trend, the state established a wide range of environmental regulative measures. The implementation of these measures will inevitably affect the competitiveness of enterprises, especially the competitiveness of coal enterprises with heavy pollution. However, there were many factors influencing the competitiveness of enterprises, such as core technology, labor costs, product differentiation, infrastructure conditions and other factors. This article thought that strict environmental regulation has a positive effect on the competitiveness of enterprises, that is strict environmental regulation could improve the competitiveness of enterprises, and through further analysis, this article thought that the strict environmental regulation was not the determinant to the competitiveness of enterprises, other factors also have significant effect on the competitiveness of enterprises...|$|R

On the other hand, keeping the system running sustainably − including how circular economy can be used to deal with waste − is an immensely complex task. Information, big data analysis and artificial intelligences are thus imagined to {{be an integral part of}} an <b>environmental</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sustainable Development, Planning and Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The study {{investigates the}} role of {{indigenous}} governance systems in sustainable development at Moshupa, Botswana. Due to time limitations, this research study has only been able to provide {{a basic understanding of}} {{the role of}} indigenous governance systems in sustainable development. The study is primarily qualitative and generated data through the use of instruments including document analysis, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. A sample of thirty-five (35) respondents from both sexes, aged twenty-eight (28) years to eighty-two (82) years constitutes the study. The sample was drawn using a “snowball sampling” procedure. Specifically, some key informants were chiefs from neighbouring villages who {{have an impact on the}} history of Bakgatla-ba-ga-Mmanaana and/or Moshupa village administration (Kanye, Thamaga, Mankgodi, Molepolole, Ramotswa, and Tlokweng), village elders and traditional doctor; whilst other respondents were selected from tribal wards, village development committee, water affairs department, crèche, Botswana Police service, sub-landboard, elected political councillors, and the youth movement because of their positions and understanding of the socio-economic and ecological processes in the community. Findings of the study indicate that like in many African countries, indigenous governance in Botswana covers a broad spectrum of issues including the participation of community in the local <b>economy,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> and social relations. The study further reveals that the quality of indigenous governance, despite its short comings, has provided communities with a solid foundation to cope with unprecedented development changes; enabled communities to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} an alternative and novel theoretical {{approach to the}} conceptualization and analysis of payments for environmental services (PES). We devote special emphasis to institutional and political <b>economy</b> <b>issues,</b> which have been somewhat neglected {{in the literature on}} PES. We argue that the Coasean and pure market approach dominating the conceptualization of PES in the literature cannot be easily generalized and implemented in practice. By contrast, taking into account complexities related to uncertainty, distributional issues, social embeddedness, and power relations permits acknowledging the variety of contexts and institutional settings in which PES operate. The alternative approach presented in this introductory article to the special section may be more appealing to PES practitioners, since while avoiding restrictive and prescriptive standpoints, it allows some key sources of complexities they usually deal with on the ground to be more easily understood.
