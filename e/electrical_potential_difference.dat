Procter & Wilson (1916) demonstrated that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions.

In particular, he found that an <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the H+ concentration.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Transtubular and peritubular face <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> (P. D.) of the {{proximal}} tubules of the kidney of the amphibian Necturus maculosus have been measured in situ. These measurements {{have been carried}} out both under normal conditions, when the tubular fluid originates in the glomerular filtrate, and under conditions when the composition of the tubular fluid has been altered using the stopped flow microperfusion technique. Under normal conditions the transtubular <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> is 20 mv. (lumen-negative) and the P. D. across the peritubular face is 74 my. (cell-negative). The P. D. across the luminal face is thus 54 my. (cell-negative). This electrical asymmetry is not influenced by replacing the normal tubular fluid by NaC 1, NaCI + mannitol, or by alteration in the intraluminal pH from 7 to 4. On the other hand, replacement of Na by K or choline and the addition of small amounts of DNP to the perfusate diminish this asymmetry.

40|$|Electrically active cells {{within the}} human body {{generate}} currents in the tissues surrounding these cells. These currents are called volume currents. The volume currents in turn give rise to <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> between electrodes attached to the body. When these electrodes {{are attached to the}} torso, <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> generated by the heart are recorded. The recording of these <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> as a function of time is called an electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG measurements can be used to compute the generators within the heart. This is called the solution of the ECG inverse problem. This solution may be of interest for diagnostic purposes.

When the active cells are situated within the brain and the electrodes are attached to the scalp, the recording of the <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> measured between two electrodes as a function of time is called an electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG inverse problem can, for example, be used to localize an epileptic focus as part of the presurgical evaluation.

40|$|The epithelia {{lining the}} nephron form single cell layers that {{manifest}} distinctive physical properties such as transepithelial <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> and <b>electrical</b> conductances. The electrical behavior of epithelia {{is important to}} the understanding of ion movements across these structures since these are seen as electric current and ultimately depend on their conjugate force, the electrochemical <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> and a membrane property, the ionic conductance. In addition to earlier reviews [1, 2] we have recently surveyed <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> and resistances of renal tubules [3]. The majority of the presently available experimental data are derived from observations that treat the epithelium as a single diffusion barrier. However, transepithelial flows cannot be adequately understood from a description of the electrical properties of the full epithelial layer. First, morphologically renal epithelia constitute multicompartmental systems where several ion diffusion boundaries, in series or in parallel, exist rather than a single one. Moreover, electrolyte flows may appear macroscopically as electroneutral while, at the microscopic level of a single barrier, electroneutrality may be violated. Finally, electrochemical potential gradients across a complete epithelium may imply the active or passive nature of ion movements whereas entirely different inferences would follow from the driving forces that govern individual intraepithelial barriers. The present study aims at an explanation of overall transepithelial electrical phenomena {{as a function of the}} discrete electrical characteristics of single barriers, more often single cell membranes. Clearly the cell membrane approach is only one level of analysis more advanced than the overall epithelial approach. Thin biological membranes are presently treated as black-boxes because of our lack of a molecular description of ion permeation channels within the membrane phase itself. Thus, the level of understanding of renal transport processes at which we aim in this paper remains essentially phenomenological in nature. In the following we will successively discuss <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences,</b> <b>electrical</b> conductances and, finally, how these properties control ion flows through single barriers or through the full epithelial thickness. In each instance our focus will be on the single boundaries of tubule cells. The only segments that have been investigated at the single membrane level are the proximal convoluted, distal and cortical collecting tubule [3]. As a rule intracellular impalements by means of microelectrodes are a prerequisite for information about individual cell membranes. Amphibian preparations such as Necturus, Triturus or Amphiuma are most useful because of the large size and less extensive basal infoldings of the tubule cells. Potentials in mammalian cells can be studied in vivo but only after extensive immobilization of the kidney [4, 5], in kidney slices [6] or in isolated tubules [7]...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{technics}} {{are described}} which permit the measurements of stable <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> across the cell membrane of single renal tubule cells and across single tubules. The {{inside of the}} tubule lumen is normally found to be electrically nega-tive to the outside, while the cell interior {{is found to be}} negative to both the peritubular fluid and the tubule lumen. Such electrical measurements, in conjunction with known concentration gradients and flux measurements of various ions across single renal tubules, permit some deductions to be made on the driving forces involved in the move-ment of various ion species across the luminal and peritubular cell membrane of renal tubule cells. RENAL function studies have indicated that among biologic membranes involved in the transport of electrolytes, the renal tubules are exceedingly active in the net trans-fer of most ion species. However, in spite of the establishment of considerable coneentra-tion gradients across various tubular segments and the likelihood of different transfer rates of charged particles from the lumen to the peritubular fluid, factors favoring the crea-tion of <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences,</b> renal tubular structures have received relatively little attention as far as electrical phenomena are concerned. Also, little is known regarding the magnitude and the kinetics of bidirectional ion fluxes across renal tubules, although site and steepness of various ionic concentration gradients have been fairly well outlined by micropuncture studies on individual nephrons.
