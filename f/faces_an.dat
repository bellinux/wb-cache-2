Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to return to Hogwarts after the gate to Platform 9¾ is sealed by Dobby.

40|$|The US Department of Energy has {{formulated}} various sets {{of gasoline}} fuels, called fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE), which are consistent in composition and properties. The analysis of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (paraffin-rich) is studied by replacing the 66 components with 19 components to represent this fuel. The {{reduction in the}} number of components is based on merging components from the same chemical groups and having the same chemical formula, which have very close thermophysical properties; the components with the highest initial compositions are chosen to be the representative components. Modelling of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel and various surrogates is carried out based on the effective thermal conductivity/effective diffusivity model (ETC/ED). The model takes into account the effect of finite liquid thermal conductivity, finite liquid mass diffusivity and recirculation inside the droplets due to their non-zero velocities relative to the ambient air. Four surrogates of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> found in the literature are used in the analysis. These surrogates include the five component surrogate chosen for its ability to match the ignition delay time of the <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (Surr 1), the primary reference fuel surrogate (PRF 84) that matches the research octane number (RON) of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> the one that matches hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C), RON, density and distillation curve with <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> (Surr 2), and the one that matches the RON based on mole fraction linear blending (Surr 3). It is shown that these surrogates cannot predict adequately the time evolution of surface temperatures and radii of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplets. New „physical‟ surrogates with 8, 7 and 6 components (Surr 4, Surr 5, and Surr 6) are introduced to match the evaporation characteristics of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> It is found that Surr 5 (7 components surrogate) can predict droplet lifetime and time evolution of surface temperature of <b>a</b> <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplet with errors of up to 5 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. Also, the results show that the H/C, molecular weight and RON of the new surrogates are reasonably close to those of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> These results allow us to recommend that <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel can be replaced by the 7 component surrogate that matches H/C, molecular weight, and the RON of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> and adequately predicts the lifetime and surface temperatures of this particular fuel droplet...|$|R

Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are presently under investigation for fraud in the National Herald scam.

Entrance into politics by Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra is fraught with uncertainty due to ongoing investigations into business dealings brokered by her husband Robert Vadra.

The political elimination of dynastic heirs from prominent political families who have dominated Indian politics for decades (Palaniappan Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Oscar Fernandes, Sachin Pilot) has resulted in the advent of a new breed of Indian politicians who feel no obligation to stick to traditional approaches and constraints in domestic and foreign relations.

25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} what purpose. This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance <b>faces</b> <b>an</b> unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} 808s & Heartbreak draws heavily on {{electronic}} elements, particularly virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Tracks {{on the album}} utilize step input drum machine and synth-bass parts. Step input sequencing, a product of vintage analogue devices limited to recording only 16 individual notes, was popular in music production during the 1980s, but also became available in digital workstations. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synths, and somber piano. Andy Kellman of AllMusic writes of the music, [...] "Several tracks have almost as {{much in common with}} irrefutably bleak post-punk albums, such as New Order's Movement and The Cure's Pornography, as contemporary rap and R" [...] These musical elements help convey moods of despair and dejection that reflect the album's subject matter. NJ.com columnist Trist McCall wrote that the record [...] "stripped modern art-pop down to its iconic rudiments — beats, charismatic personalities, hand-selected melodies, and computer-assisted vocals." [...] Most of the lyrics are directed at an ex-lover; West refers to her treatment of him as [...] "the coldest story ever told" [...] on [...] "Heartless", and on [...] "RoboCop", she is called a [...] "spoiled little L.A. girl" [...] and is compared to the antagonist in the 1990 film Misery. On [...] "Welcome to Heartbreak", West's character <b>faces</b> <b>an</b> existential crisis as he dispassionately recounts sitting alone on a flight, with a laughing family seated ahead of him. He longs for his late mother on the album's penultimate track [...] "Coldest Winter", which samples the desolate 1983 song [...] "Memories Fade" [...] by Tears for Fears.|$|E
