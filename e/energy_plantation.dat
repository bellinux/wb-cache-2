During the exploitation cycle, not only do short rotation <b>energy</b> <b>plantations</b> produce woody biomass for energy production, but they also accumulate large amounts of carbon from the soil and air. In this case, the <b>energy</b> <b>plantations</b> are primarily environmentally friendly, which is accompanied by their economic importance.

For some variables, the best farm method was also employed for projections. The application of the method is illustrated by projecting a plausible scenario for the rural segment of Kanyakumari District for the year 1995.

In this study, the possible changes of suitable species are assessed by examining the current and the future prospects and potentials with biomass energy derived from <b>energy</b> <b>plantations</b> in Estonia, taking climate change into consideration. The biomass energy potentials for the species that are climate suitable in current and future time are manually estimated, using a case study approach when determining the yields.

Among these biomass species, the components of Sida were found to have the highest carbon and hydrogen contents and energy values. In general, the results indicated lowest ash contents and highest energy values for their stumps, followed by branch, leaf, and bark, respectively. The fusion temperature results have been reported to be relatively higher (1, 250 – 1, 500 ıC) for Anisomales and Sida biomass ashes, indicating safe boiler operation up to about 1, 100 – 1, 200 ıC with these biomass materials.
