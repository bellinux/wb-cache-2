5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E

By 2000, the 100th has assumed <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for running the camp. Later that same year, the 100th began deactivating {{many of its}} M1A1 Abrams tanks {{as part of a}} reduction in military expenditures.|$|E
5|$|First, {{let me say}} I take <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for my {{own actions}} {{and for those of}} my administration. As angry as I may be about {{activities}} undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} scrutiny being {{imposed by}} the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more drastic measures by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> of their day-to-day operations.|$|E

If any Muslim says anything other than this, he is not understanding Sharia." ...|$|R
5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that more than 400,000 street children in India exist.Mainly because of family conflict, they come {{to live on the}} streets and take on the <b>full</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of caring for themselves, including working to provide for and protecting themselves.

5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces {{found it impossible}} to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role in}} shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E
5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in {{their opposition to the}} article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{establishing}} the Office through Security Council resolution 1904 (2009), the United Nations issued {{a press release}} stating that the individual serving as the Ombudsperson should be “an eminent individual of high moral character, impartiality and integrity with high qualifications and experience in relevant fields, such as legal, human rights, counter-terrorism and sanctions”. The <b>full</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of the Ombudsperson’s Office are set out in Annex II of the resolution.|$|R
5|$|The LNER did {{not want}} to take <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the line, and {{although}} they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned to electrify the Chesham branch; instead, a diesel-powered GWR railcar was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the railcar performed well on the curves and slopes of the branch, the railcar had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, railcar design, {{but by the end of}} 1936, it decided instead to electrify the Chesham branch, and the railcar schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont& Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} the game sparked {{immediate}} player backlash {{in addition to its}} negative critical reception. Some of the controversy was produced by the use of gameplay features unusual for the genre. The main complaint by players was the user interface, followed by problems with the performance and aspects of gameplay. The initial 30-day free trial was extended twice in order to allow players to experience the new development team's updates before committing to the game. In December 2010, it was announced that Tanaka and Komoto had been removed from their posts as producer and director, with Tanaka taking <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the game's problems. The PS3 version was indefinitely delayed from its original March 2011 release date, with Square Enix saying that it would not release the game for that platform until it fully met the quality standards suitable for the Final Fantasy series. Subscriptions for the Windows version were also suspended indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Chicago 2016 Olympic bid {{placed the}} main {{site of the}} $1.1 billion residential complex, which would have accommodated athletes in an Olympic Village in the 4th Ward. Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} the Olympic Village from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. On September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract that included financial guarantees putting <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8 billion operating budget on taxpayers.|$|E

UMIT was asked to continue to provide law enforcement until the PNTL would assume its <b>full</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Furthermore, the UNMIT operation was required to provide assistance in the field of human rights, reform of the judiciary and donor co-operation, while the government was asked to strengthen peacebuilding initiatives.|$|R

5|$|Ueland was {{unanimously}} fired as CEO by NSB's {{board on}} 29 June. Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned, {{after she had}} rejected the board's proposal for her to become acting CEO. The same day, Adtranz assumed <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the defects, and guaranteed that they would cover NSB's costs. In a report, Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined every , which would mean weekly inspections. They stated that they hoped further inquiries {{would find a way}} to have less frequent inspections. This was rejected by NSB, who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme. Instead, Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, ISCB was in {{financial}} difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in Brisbane and ISMB 2006, in Fortaleza) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction in income. To allow more delegates to attend, {{it was decided to}} limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007. ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. , this pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2019. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in Vienna, Austria) marked the first conference for which ISCB took <b>full</b> <b>responsibility</b> for organising. Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, Boston (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.|$|E
