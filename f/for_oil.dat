5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil shale industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil shale industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil shale gas and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> shale mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially <b>for</b> <b>oil,</b> the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill <b>for</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing of fields <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state. Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what they were before statehood.|$|E
