50|$|In Ireland, section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 {{abolished}} the <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> in Ireland and converted existing <b>fees</b> <b>tail</b> to <b>fees</b> simple. For constitutional reasons, this section {{is subject to}} a saving clause which prevents the conversion of <b>fees</b> <b>tail</b> to <b>fees</b> simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, <b>fees</b> <b>tail</b> still exist in Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> {{has been}} {{abolished}} {{in all but}} four states in the United States: Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware and Rhode Island.

In Rhode Island, a <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. New York abolished <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> results in a fee simple; even in those four states that still allow <b>fee</b> <b>tail,</b> the estate holder may convert his <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> to a <b>fee</b> simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.|$|R

50|$|Estate in land {{can also}} be divided into estates of {{inheritance}} and other estates that are not of inheritance.

Andrzej Zamoyski, who was the 10th ordynat, trying to buy support of Austrian Emperor Joseph II, invited some 100 native German families to settle in the estate.
