5|$|After {{completing}} {{his mission to}} Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he {{had a meeting with}} Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree (firman) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal Football Club {{was founded}} in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now {{southeast}} London. They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later. They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed. They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913. After the First World War <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E

5|$|Blamey {{was always}} {{interested}} in technical innovation, and was receptive to unorthodox ideas. He {{was instrumental in the}} adoption of the periscope rifle at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an inspection of the front line. <b>He</b> <b>arranged</b> for the inventor, Lance Corporal W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{refused to}} cast {{blame for the}} defeat, which he {{understood}} {{was likely to be}} final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} at Baroda he contributed to many {{articles}} to Indu Prakash and spoke as a {{chairman of the}} Baroda college board. He started taking an active interest {{in the politics of}} India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, while traveling to these states. He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita. <b>He</b> <b>arranged</b> the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee (Niralamba Swami) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.|$|E

He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. <b>He</b> <b>arranged</b> a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up {{plans for}} the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E

5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> for the printing of the Tables at his own expense.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. <b>He</b> <b>arranged</b> for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 Rambhadradas {{established}} a religious {{and social service}} institution called Tulsi Peeth (The seat of Tulsi) in Chitrakoot, where, according to the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile. As {{the founder of the}} seat, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally, the Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon him by Sadhus and intellectuals.

5|$|In April 1990, <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> {{for several}} hundred Asháninka to make a five-day trek from the central {{highlands}} into the mountains of Peru at Tzibokiroato.

Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted to the use of violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E
5|$|Jim Jones, {{the founder}} {{and leader of the}} Peoples Temple, tried to use Branham's fame to boost himself into the limelight. Jones, who was later known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978, {{organized}} a religious convention that took place June 11 through June 15, 1956, at Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis. To draw crowds, Jones needed a religious headliner, so <b>he</b> <b>arranged</b> to share the pulpit with Branham.|$|E
