50|$|The bale hoist {{was used}} to load bales of wool onto {{transports}} and {{is located on the}} rear eastern side of the woolshed, adjacent to the powerhouse. The hoist is made from steel and consists of a vertical upright with a horizontal arm at the top. The arm is supported by decorative steel bracing. Part of the hydraulic power network, the hoist had a single cable that operated through a series of sheaves; the lower sheave is now missing. Historical evidence suggests a ball weight was mounted above the <b>hoist</b> <b>hook,</b> which was sufficient enough to pull the cable to the ground and force the piston into position for the next lift. The vertical upright of the hoist is supported by two angled steel braces.|$|R
60|$|While {{we talked}} outside with friends, Barney and Satan placed the hand-baggage, books, fruits, and soda-bottles in the racks, and the hold-alls and heavy baggage in the closet, hung the {{overcoats}} and sun-helmets and towels on the <b>hooks,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the two bed-shelves {{up out of}} the way, then shouldered their bedding and retired to the third class.|$|R

50|$|Auk {{accordingly}} altered {{course at}} 0905 and plunged through the rough seas and a veritable curtain of fog, while her foghorn blared its warning. She anchored that afternoon, but waves breaking over the after deck foiled attempts to rig the heavy-duty wrecking pumps into the after hold (into which {{the water was}} coming, through the rudder stock) since {{it was impossible to}} remove the hatch without allowing more water to get below in the process. Then just as the fog began to lift to the northward and the ship prepared to weigh anchor and get underway, the anchor engine jammed. Quick repairs enabled Auk's men {{to begin the process of}} <b>hoisting</b> up the <b>hook,</b> and the minesweeper got underway and eventually reached safe haven in the lee of Montauk Point.|$|R
5000|$|The CH-47B was {{an interim}} {{solution}} while Boeing {{worked on a}} more substantially improved CH-47C. The CH-47B was powered by two Lycoming T55-L-7C 2,850 shp (2,130 kW) engines. It featured a blunted rear rotor pylon, redesigned asymmetrical rotor blades, and strakes along the rear ramp and fuselage to improve flying characteristics. It could be equipped with two door-mounted M60D 7.62 mm NATO machine guns on the M24 armament subsystem and a ramp-mounted M60D using the M41 armament subsystem. Some CH-47 [...] "bombers" [...] were equipped to drop tear gas or napalm from the rear cargo ramp onto NLF (Việt Cộng) bunkers. The CH-47B could be equipped with a <b>hoist</b> and cargo <b>hook.</b> The Chinook proved especially valuable in [...] "Pipe Smoke" [...] aircraft recovery missions. The [...] "Hook" [...] recovered about 12,000 aircraft valued at over $3.6 billion during the war; 108 were built.|$|R
50|$|The AS350 {{has proven}} popular {{in a wide}} range of roles; as such, {{multiple}} cabin configurations can be used, between four and six passengers in a typical seating configuration, and large sliding doors can be fitted to either side of the cabin. In some operators' fleets, the furnishings of the cabin has been designed to enable the internal space and/or equipment fit-out to be rapidly reconfigured to enable aircraft to be switched between diverse operational roles. Public service operators, such as those in law enforcement, often have forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras and other mission systems installed on their aircraft. Other optional equipment on offer to operates had included real-time data links, rescue <b>hoists,</b> underslung cargo <b>hooks,</b> electrical external mirrors, search lights, tactical consoles, night vision goggle-compatibility, moving-map system, internal cabin tie-downs, second battery kit, sand filters, wire strike protection system, 4-channel radio, tail rotor arch, cabin floor windows, and removable seats.|$|R
