40|$|International audiencePhthalates and alkylphenols are toxics {{classified}} as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). They {{are of particular}} concern due to their ubiquity and generally higher levels found in the environment comparatively to other EDCs. Industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> might {{affect the quality of}} receiving waters by discharging organic matter and contaminants through treated waters and combined sewer overflows. Historically, industrial discharges are often considered as the principal vector of pollution in urban areas. If this observation was true in the past for some contaminants, no current data are today available to compare the quality of industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> as regards EDCs. In this context, a total of 45 domestic samples as well as 101 industrial samples were collected from different sites, including 14 residential and 33 industrial facilities. This study focuses more specifically on 4 phthalates and 2 alkylphenols, among the most commonly studied congeners. A particular attention was also given to routine wastewater quality parameters. For most substances, wastewaters from the different sites were heavily contaminated; they display concentrations up to 1200. μg/l for di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate and between 10 and 100. μg/l for diethyl phthalate and nonylphenol. Overall, for the majority of compounds, the industrial contribution to the flux of contaminant reaching the wastewater treatment plants ranges between 1 and 3 %. The data generated during this work constitutes one of the first studies conducted in Europe on industrial fluxes for a variety of sectors of activity. The study of the wastewater contribution was used to better predict the industrial and domestic contributions at the scale of a huge conurbation heavily urbanized but with a weak industrial cover, illustrated by Paris. Our results indicate that specific investigations on <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> are necessary {{in order to reduce the}} release of phthalates and alkylphenols in the sewer systems for such conurbations. © 2014 Elsevier B.

Eutrophication in Chinese watershed is mainly due to nitrogen and phosphorus output from agricultural source. Taihu Lake is a typical eutrophic lake in China, a basin representative {{for the study of the}} temporal-spatial characteristics of pollution loading of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide scientific basis for reasonable estimation and targeted control measures of nitrogen and phosphorus loss. Based on data from nitrogen and phosphorus loss in agricultural land, livestock breeding, <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> and aquaculture, this study calculated the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk for each pollution source. Using the superposition of ArcGIS raster data, we also described the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk by the formula of comprehensive loss risk. The results showed that critical risk areas of nitrogen and phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding and agricultural land during flood period in Tiaoxi watershed. Agricultural land and livestock breeding sources formed major parts of nitrogen loss, accounting for 30. 85 % and 36. 18 %, respectively, while phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding (56. 28 %). During non-flood period, integrated management of livestock breeding and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> requires much attention to control nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the critical risk area. Finally, it is of great practical significance to propose spatial-temporal targeted measurements to control nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in watershed for various periods and different areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecological}} footprint (EF) is an accepted worldwide method {{for the evaluation}} of environmental sustainability. However, its utility is limited by the existence of a series of shortcomings in the methodology such as the only-partial inclusion of human generated wastes. To improve the ability of the footprint method to evaluate environmental sustainability, a new footprint-based indicator - the &# 39;Waste Absorption Footprint&# 39; (WAF) - has been proposed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to test this methodological approach by evaluating the sustainability of the water environment in the Taihu Lake Basin, in densely populated eastern China. Applying the WAF method indicates that anthropogenic discharges of wastes have imposed an absorption pressure on the local water system such that the local water environment is increasingly unsustainable. Furthermore, nitrogen and phosphorus are identified as more critical wastes than organic substances, while <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> are shown to be more important sources compared with those from industry and agriculture, which therefore should be the focus of environmental management and pollution control initiatives.

In the last century these lakes were exposed to various disturbances caused by urbanization, agricultural activities, <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> and recreational use. Due to their small watershed and great water renewal time, they can be considered as very sensitive to degradation and their major suffering problems are eutrophication, hypolimnetic deoxygenation, meromixis and lowering of water level. We report here some biological data collected in the last decades on five volcanic lakes with the aim of evaluating their present trophic status by means of some biological parameters of all the lacustrine communities useful to detect water quality changes and suggesting some monitoring guidelines to enhance conservation and managing policies of the lakes. In a trophic scale, Lake Bracciano revealed the most oligotrophic characteristics, due to the presence of an o-ring waste water collecting system, its large size and depth, and the strong hydrodynamism. Lake Martignano follows in the rank, with some symptoms of stress in the hypolimnion due to a marked summer deoxygenation. Lake Vico, which showed in the past decades a mesotrophic condition with clear signals of increasing trophy and oxygen depletion in the profundal, have a trend towards meso-eutrophy. Lake Albano showed meso-eutrophic conditions with the total absence of fauna below 120 m depth due to a meromictic status, also evidentiated by palaeolimnological studies.
