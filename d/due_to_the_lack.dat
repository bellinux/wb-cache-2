5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of detailed records.|$|E
5|$|It {{may also}} appear suspect because similar events are not {{observed}} in other ice ages (Hemming 2004), although {{this may be}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of high-resolution sediments.|$|E
5|$|Other liver-related {{complications}} (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) {{are treated}} with the same modalities as used in cirrhosis, although the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt treatment is discouraged <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of documented benefit.|$|E
50|$|Lonesome and {{medicament}} addict narcotics detective Herbert Strähl (Roeland Wiesnekker), who hardly {{can handle}} his own life, wants <b>to</b> clean up <b>the</b> Langstrasse area. Strähl often watches Berisha (Adem Kicai), {{the head of}} a drug trafficking ring, leaving his limousine and entering a dubious building, but he isn’t able <b>to</b> arrest him, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of an evidence (Berisha never touches the drugs by himself).|$|R
30|$|Peterson et al. (2011) {{conducted}} a simulation of integrated project management within two classes at Stanford and TU Twente, using pre-made BIM models in Revit, Tekla and AutoCAD 2006 and 2007 (which {{in our understanding}} cannot be considered as BIM models <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of parametric characteristics), the models were imported in the various cost and scheduling software such as Primavera or Vico.|$|R
40|$|For {{thousands}} of years, moxibustion {{has been used}} for various diseases in China and other Asian countries. Despite the recent surge in Chinese herbal studies, few randomized controlled trials have been conducted on this modality, possibly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of suitable double blinding methodology. This is a review of extant sham moxa devices and an introduction to a recently developed device that needs further validation...|$|R
5|$|When {{the first}} neutral atoms formed from {{a sea of}} {{primordial}} ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of stellar energy sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{seamless}} 40-second driving scene, {{in which}} Michael Sullivan {{and his son}} travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at LaSalle Street, and <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of scenery {{for part of the}} drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Aksum's {{currency}} {{served as}} a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity). It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived. The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of extensive archaeological work in the area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's <b>lack</b> of {{a drummer}} at the time, the {{drumming}} {{was produced in}} a drum machine program.|$|R
50|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album's <b>lack</b> of promotion, {{it would}} only managed to debut at number 42 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|R
50|$|In the PSP spin-offs, a more {{conventional}} control scheme must be used, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PSP's <b>lack</b> of a right analog stick.|$|R
5|$|Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus {{exhibits}} microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{relocated}} to Montana in 2010, and founded the Liberty Fellowship, believing {{the people of}} the state responded well to his constitutionalist message. In 2012, he briefly ran for Lieutenant Governor of Montana as the running mate of Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Bob Fanning, but dropped out <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of campaign funds.|$|E
5|$|Common mammals {{found here}} include the red fox, red squirrel, hare and rabbit, mole, wood mouse, bank vole and field vole. Two species of bats {{frequent}} the site regularly to hunt: the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). They cannot, however, establish their habitat <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of roosting {{sites in the}} reserve's young trees.|$|E
50|$|Population {{growth is}} {{relatively}} low in Magallanes <b>due</b> <b>to</b> outmigration. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> {{of employment and}} educational opportunities has caused <b>the</b> skilled workers <b>to</b> settle elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|Nonetheless, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> partners' <b>lack</b> of {{business}} experience and their scant resources put into starting the business, critical and public acclaim did not translate into big earnings.|$|R
50|$|Semi-intensive farming {{corresponds}} to fattening of ovine, bovine, caprine, porcine. It {{is the most}} dominant, <b>due</b> mainly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of space and the predominance of the fattening of livestock farrow.|$|R
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of {{a nominal}} roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part}} in the D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of {{any form}} of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the explosive growth {{of the region and}} adequate funding, the result is one of the nation's most expansive freeway networks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of playing}} {{fields in the}} valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded {{but many of the}} clubs survive to this day.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{the demand}} for public {{expenditures}} has been estimated using as explanatory variables the average values of per capita income, {{as well as other}} variables. The results of this approach are disappointing which is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> theoretical basis. <b>The</b> public choice model, on the other hand, uses the political decision-making process (median voter model) to explain expenditures. Taking the same set of data, it is shown that the public choice approach yields superior results. It also offers a solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unfruitful discussion about the influence of political determinants of public expenditures...|$|R
50|$|In 1807, Napoleon recreated the duchy of Siewierz (Sievers), {{and granted}} it to Jean Lannes, after Prussia {{was forced to}} cede all her {{acquisitions}} from the 2nd and 3rd partitions of Poland. After the failure of Napoleon, Siewierz {{was included in the}} Congress Poland, under Imperial Russian rule. The city declined continuously, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of industry and communication. In 1870, it lost its city status. In 1918, Siewierz became part of the Second Polish Republic, from 1939 to 1945 of Nazi Germany. In 1962 it regained its city status.|$|R
30|$|The {{defective}} {{closing of}} the bulbous portion of <b>the</b> urethra <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> partial <b>lack</b> of spongiosum tissue. It often occurs at the ventral aspect of the anterior urethra (Fahraeus 1991).|$|R
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field on Venus, {{the solar wind}} penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of their}} own ground, F.C. United played their home matches at {{multiple}} stadia around Greater Manchester between 2005 and 2015, including Bury's Gigg Lane, Curzon Ashton's Tameside Stadium and Stalybridge Celtic's Bower Fold, among others. The club moved into its own 4,400-capacity Broadhurst Park in north-east Manchester for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|During the {{presentation}} of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory. Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders, but Delgado, Hampsten and LeMond also received many votes. Many media outlets felt that the overall victory would likely go to a non-Italian rider <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of Italian general classification competitors, but that Visentini had the best chance of winning out of competing Italians.|$|E
50|$|George Alexander Rix VD (1865-2 April 1945) was {{the third}} Anglican Bishop of Caledonia in Canada. He was elected to this {{position}} after an interregnum of four years <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diocese's <b>lack</b> of funds.|$|R
50|$|If {{it comes}} to that, there may not only be one King and Queen. However, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elves' <b>lack</b> of {{imagination}} and creativity any Kings and Queens of <b>the</b> Elves tend <b>to</b> be similar.|$|R
50|$|In an {{era when}} death in {{speedway}} racing was generally accepted <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>lack</b> of safety, Farndon was <b>the</b> only rider <b>to</b> die {{as a result of}} a crash at New Cross Stadium.|$|R
5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming {{an important source of}} business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E
5|$|Majority of the {{residents}} are engaged in secondary sector involving match works, fireworks and printing industry. During the 2001 census, the occupational pattern indicated increasing presence of the tertiary sector. The agricultural output of the town is limited, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of favourable geographical and climatic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to some degree, this void may be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of will to record their history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.|$|E
40|$|IEC 61850 Communication Protocol Architecture {{is widely}} used in China's {{electricity}} system for communication between the substation automatic systems. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of corresponding security specification, the standards cannot guarantee the confidentiality, integrity as well as authentication in communication. This paper proposes a solution for this problem. The improved Handshake Protocol and Record Protocol are introduced between the application layer and the transport layer with less transmission of data and quick connect feature. Using this solution, the standards can meet both the electricity system for real-time and reliability requirements and the security requirements at the same time...|$|R
