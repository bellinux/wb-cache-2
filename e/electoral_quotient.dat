50|$|The current {{threshold}} {{in order}} to obtain seats is 50% of the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> (total votes divided by total seats) in constituencies with over two seats and 30% of the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> in constituencies with two seats. Seats are then distributed using the distributing number, or cifra repartidora method explained in article 263 of the Constitution.|$|E

5000|$|In Burkina Faso, the National Assembly {{is elected}} by a {{proportional}} representational system. Proportional representation in Burkina Faso means {{that each person}} marks one party on the ballot, and after tallying the votes, the top parties chosen are elected to the Assembly. Each electoral province has a simple <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient.</b> This {{is the number of}} valid votes counted divided by the number of seats available. If a party wins a seat by the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient,</b> usually half of the votes, then the remainder of the seats are transferred to a [...] "rest" [...] category, which are compared to the other votes gathered. For example, in the province of Boulkiemde, the MPP received 29,445 votes, which is 35.1% of the total votes of the province. Boulkiemde elects four representatives to their legislature, so their <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> is 21002 votes (84007÷4). This means that the MPP will receive one seat from the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient.</b> The remaining votes are transferred to another category, which is compared among the other candidates. These remaining votes in Boulkiemde won the MPP another seat in the legislature, since the remaining votes (8443) are the second highest compared {{to the rest of the}} parties (CDP=16968, UPC=8099). Thus, since the MPP received 35.1% of the votes, they received 50% of the seats due to the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, the {{constitution}} mandates that redistribution occur [...] "on {{the completion of}} each decennial census." [...] District boundaries are based on <b>electoral</b> <b>quotients,</b> with some exceptions. When the census indicates that a population change has occurred, an independent boundary commission issues a report of recommended changes. Changes are only made if passed into law—by Parliament for national redistribution, by the provincial legislature for provincial redistribution.|$|R
50|$|A {{province}} may {{be allocated}} extra seats over its base entitlement {{to ensure that}} these rules are met. In 2004, for example, Prince Edward Island would have been entitled to only a single seat according to the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient,</b> but through the senatorial clause the province gained three more seats to equal its four senators. Quebec was only entitled to 68 seats by the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> alone, but through the grandfather clause the province gained seven seats to equal the 75 seats {{it had in the}} 33rd Parliament. Saskatchewan and Manitoba also gained seats under the grandfather clause, New Brunswick gained seats under the senatorial clause, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador gained seats under both clauses.|$|E
50|$|This riding is {{the least}} populous in Canada. Citing the region's highly {{distinct}} identity and seeing it as a community of interest they have the legal duty to respect, successive electoral boundary commissions have used their ability to make exceptions to the general <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> to maintain Labrador as a separate riding.|$|E
50|$|For {{elections}} to the House, political parties or other movements and groups run single lists, {{with a number}} of candidates not exceeding the total number of seats to be filled, although in constituencies with only two seats, party lists may include a third name. The current threshold for parties to win seats in a territorial constituency is 50% of the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> (total votes divided by total seats) in constituencies returning more than two members, and 30% of the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> in constituencies returning two members. Seats are then distributed using the distributing number, or cifra repartidora. This number is obtained by successively dividing the number of votes received by each list by one, two, three and so forth, and placing the results in descending order until the total number of results equal to the number of seats to be filled. The lowest resulting number is called the distributing number (cifra repartidora). Each list shall obtain the number of seats that corresponds to the number of times the distributing number is contained in the total number of its votes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of these clauses, smaller provinces and provinces that have {{experienced}} a relative decline in population have become over-represented in the House. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta are under-represented in proportion to their populations, while the other seven provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) are over-represented. Boundary commissions, appointed by the federal government for each province, have the task of drawing the boundaries of the electoral districts in each province. Territorial representation is independent of population; each territory is entitled to only one seat. The calculation for the provinces is done with a base of 279 seats. The total population of the provinces (excluding the territories) is then divided by 279 to equal the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient.</b> [...] The population of the province is then divided by the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> to equal the base provincial-seat allocation. The [...] "special clauses" [...] are then applied {{to increase the number of}} seats for certain provinces, bringing the total number of seats (with the three seats for the territories) to 338.|$|E
50|$|The 1984 {{parliamentary}} election was {{held together with}} the presidential election on November 4. The percentages for National Assembly representatives were {{very similar to those}} the parties had received for their presidential candidate. The <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> needed to win one of the 90 National Assembly seats was obtained by dividing the number of valid votes in each region by the number of representatives that had been assigned to each region, proportional to its population.|$|E
5000|$|The present {{formula for}} {{adjusting}} electoral boundaries was adopted in 1985. It {{starts with the}} number of seats in Parliament at that time, 282. One seat is automatically allocated to each of Canada's three territories, leaving 279. The total population of Canada's provinces is thus divided by 279, resulting in an [...] "electoral quotient", and then the population of each individual province is divided by this <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> to determine the number of seats to which the province is officially entitled.|$|E
50|$|The town {{is located}} within the federal riding of Peace River, {{represented}} by one Member of Parliament. After winning the seat in the 2004 federal elections with Charlie Penson, the Conservative Party has retained the seat in two elections: 2006 federal elections and 2008 federal elections, with Chris Warkentin being the flag bearer. The expansive riding of 138,009 persons has an <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> of 138,009 which is {{significantly higher than the}} provincial average of 117,513 and national average of 102,639. For the next federal election, scheduled for October 2015, Peace River will become part of the newly created riding of Peace River—Westlock.|$|E
50|$|The {{governors}} of Colombia's 32 departments are elected {{to a single}} four-year term by first-past-the-post. The governor is considered {{the head of the}} local administration, but also the president's agent in the department to maintain public order and implement national policies. Each department has a departmental assembly (asamblea departamental), with between 11 and 31 members depending on the department's population, whose members are elected using the same electoral system as that used for congressional elections - namely, optional open party-list proportional representation with the threshold being equal to half of the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient.</b> Political parties choose whether their lists are 'preferential' (open) or 'non-preferential' (closed). Candidates on the party's open list are reordered based on the results, although votes cast only for the party rather than a candidate only count for purposes of seat allocation between parties.|$|E
5000|$|... 116 lists or {{candidates}} ran for 70 {{seats in}} the constitutional assembly. The Liberal Party alone accounted for 49 of these lists, having decided to run several separate lists - unlike the other parties - {{to take advantage of}} electoral rules. Voters cast their votes for a single/list candidate, with the seats then attributed using the <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> and largest remainders. The single most popular list was that of the AD M-19, led by Antonio Navarro Wolff, which won 992,613 votes and 19 seats. The list led by Álvaro Gómez Hurtado of the National Salvation Movement won 574,411 votes and elected 11 members. Misael Pastrana Borrero's list for the Social Conservative Party won 236,794 votes and 5 seats. Overall, however, the Liberal Party elected the most members, at 25, with over 31% of the popular vote. The most successful of the various Liberal lists was led by Horacio Serpa and won 138,662 and 3 seats. The government appointed four non-voting members from demobilized guerrilla groups - two from the EPL, and one apiece from the PRT and MAQL.|$|E
40|$|The article {{proposes a}} model to explain why members of Brazil?s Lower House {{transfer}} substantial legislative power {{to the president of}} the republic. Following a brief discussion of the related literature, the main approach to the phenomenon - the personal vote theory - is critiqued. The article contends that this theory is not applicable to the Brazilian case since the transfer of votes within the open-list system makes it hard for lawmakers to know who their constituency really is. In a proportional open-list system like Brazil?s, the only candidates elected are those who garner votes equal to or greater than an <b>electoral</b> <b>quotient</b> obtained by dividing the number of valid votes cast by the seats to be filled, whatever the votes obtained by other candidates on the same list. In other words, it is often the case that a given deputy is only elected thanks to the contribution of votes won by other candidates. The result is that a Brazilian deputy has no information regarding the preferences of his or her true constituency, and the president consequently becomes the intermediary in the lawmaker?s relationship with this constituency. The stance these legislators take regarding presidential policies sends out a message to their constituency about their work in the Chamber of Deputies. This likewise accounts for the importance that these lawmakers attribute to the Executive?s agenda-setting power...|$|E
