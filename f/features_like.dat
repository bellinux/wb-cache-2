5|$|Other shells add {{abilities}} {{beyond those}} in the basic interpreter, including IDLE and IPython. While generally following the visual style of the Python shell, they implement <b>features</b> <b>like</b> auto-completion, session state retention, and syntax highlighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{village was}} {{designed}} according to modern architecture and {{was said to}} have adopted green <b>features</b> <b>like</b> solar water heating. Key facilities such as a restaurant, medical centre, and a conference hall with a seating capacity of 800 people were hosted there. Rhythmic gymnast Fabrizia D'Ottavio was appointed the mayor of the village.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the capitulation, Imperos hull was 88% {{complete}} and the engines were 76% complete, but overall the ship was only 28% complete; it would have required about eighteen more months of full work to be finished. Key <b>features</b> <b>like</b> the armament, electrical wiring and a reworking of the bridge had still not been completed.|$|E

5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas and decided to exclude it. It was desirable to narrow down {{the gap between the}} ability of veteran and novice players. Therefore, gameplay <b>features</b> <b>like</b> the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} <b>features</b> <b>like</b> the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the brain}} {{featured}} {{in popular culture}} through phrenology, a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to {{different regions of the}} cortex. The cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire. The brain features in science fiction, with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (beings with <b>features</b> <b>like</b> partly artificial brains). The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.|$|E
30|$|In general {{anatomical}} features, e.g. size or eye color, suggest suitable s-methods implementations. In principle any measurable anatomical {{or otherwise}} constant <b>feature</b> (<b>like</b> a painted mark) that discriminates the flies is applicable.|$|R

5|$|On November 22, {{the game}} {{received}} a Thanksgiving-themed update. The update added outfits and decorations. On December 10, the game received update 1.3 which added new <b>features</b> <b>like</b> pets including Dogmeat, ability to evict Vault dwellers, a sell all function for clearing out the inventory {{at once and}} new pickup lines and conversations for Vault dwellers. The update also added snow and Christmas-themed decorations.|$|E
5|$|The species Pholiota squarrosoides has {{a similar}} outward appearance, {{but it may be}} {{distinguished}} by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic <b>features,</b> <b>like</b> the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and also their habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of <b>features</b> <b>like</b> fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E
50|$|On June 17, 2002, Microsoft {{announced}} {{the release of}} version 5.2 (the first Mac OS X-only release) which included a few performance and security fixes and support for Mac OS X <b>features</b> <b>likes</b> Quartz text smoothing.|$|R
25|$|Jump-off Joe was a {{significant}} coastal <b>feature,</b> <b>like</b> its more stable neighbor, Yaquina Head. Yaquina Head is mainly composed of basalt and breccia, susceptible to erosion at a much slower rate than the sandstone of Jump-off Joe.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydrological}} code or hydrologic unit code is {{a sequence}} of numbers or letters that identify a hydrological <b>feature</b> <b>like</b> a river, river reach, lake, or area like a drainage basin (also called watershed (in North America)) or catchment.|$|R
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to <b>features</b> <b>like</b> its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic <b>features</b> <b>like</b> mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Green Hill is {{the first}} level of Sonic the Hedgehog. Located on South Island, it is a lush, grassy stage with unique <b>features</b> <b>like</b> droopy palm trees and {{crumbling}} cliffs. In addition, as with later levels in the game, Green Hill has environmental features and obstacles like ramps, vertical loops, tunnels, spring-boards, spikes, and checkpoints. It is normally populated by woodland creatures, but antagonist Doctor Eggman imprisons them inside robots known as Badniks prior {{to the events of}} the game, so the player must destroy them to free the animals. Green Hill consists of three acts, and the end of Act 3 features a boss battle with Eggman. After beating Eggman, Sonic moves on to the second level, the lava-themed Marble Zone.|$|E
50|$|Again, Media Interface is {{supported}} and maps are stored {{on a hard}} disk and restricted, as with NTG3.5, by a PIN based rights management protection <b>feature.</b> <b>Like</b> NTG3/3.5 {{it also has a}} separate rotary controller (although smaller than for NTG3/3.5 based vehicles).|$|R
50|$|The Meanest Doll in the World is a children's {{novel by}} Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin. First {{published}} in 2003, it is {{a sequel to}} The Doll People, <b>featuring,</b> <b>like</b> the other books in the series, dolls who are secretly alive.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "autodock" [...] <b>feature,</b> <b>like</b> {{those of}} Russian Progress {{spacecraft}} and the European Automated Transfer Vehicle, with provision {{for the flight}} crew to take over in an emergency. Prior American spacecraft (Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle) have all needed manual piloting for docking.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller <b>features</b> <b>like</b> sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like <b>features</b> <b>like</b> Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The Shalya Parva of the Mahabharata {{mentions}} {{characteristics of}} a host of Matrikas, who serve Skanda. Ninety-two of them are named but the text says there exist more. The Shalya Parva describes them as young, cheerful, most of them fair but having dangerous <b>features</b> <b>like</b> long nails and large teeth. They are said to fight like Indra in battles, invoking terror in minds of enemies; speak different foreign tongues and lives in inaccessible places away from human settlements like crossroads, caves, mountains, springs, forests, riverbanks and cremation grounds. Notable among these lists of Matrikas is Putana, a goddess who tried to kill the infant Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) by suckling him with poisoned breast milk and consequently killed by Krishna.|$|E
50|$|Since Zumba is so young, it is {{a perfect}} example of a simple crater. On Mars, a simple crater is {{generally}} less than 6-9 km in diameter with a conical-bowl shape, little wall collapse, and it lacks a well-developed central <b>feature,</b> <b>like</b> a central peak.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{the group}} {{released}} Biomechanical Ejaculations Of The Damned, <b>featuring</b> songs <b>like</b> [...] "The AIDS Infested Blood Of Christ" [...] and [...] "Baptized In Semen". Their 2003 album is entitled All Things Disturbingly Sassy, <b>featuring</b> tunes <b>like</b> [...] "Mrs. Potatohead" [...] and [...] "My God is Heroin." ...|$|R
50|$|Blackstar {{produces}} guitar pedals in the categories: Boost, Overdrive, Distortion, Distx, modulation, reverb, delay, Dual and Metal. Some of {{the pedals}} incorporate valves (tubes) in the electronics, the drive pedals incorporate Blackstars ISF <b>feature.</b> <b>Like</b> the HT-5, {{some of the}} pedals have an emulated speaker output, allowing for direct recording.|$|R
5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay <b>features</b> <b>like</b> a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E
5|$|The levels contain <b>features</b> <b>like</b> {{vertical}} loops, springs, and rails {{that the}} player can grind on. Each level {{is divided into}} three acts, punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end; all three acts, the boss fight, and two minigames that grant the player extra lives are bound by a hub world. Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a Chaos Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.|$|E
5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The engine features alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing <b>features</b> <b>like</b> hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less advanced than others of the time.|$|E
50|$|The {{chain of}} custody can be less {{stringent}} when dealing with property which has a unique identifying <b>feature</b> <b>like</b> a serial number. In such a case, the physical security becomes the main concern of the person recovering the item. Such security is normally achieved by booking the item into a central evidence room.|$|R
50|$|The {{instructions}} {{supplied with}} the sets <b>featured</b> cartoon <b>like</b> cars examples.|$|R
