40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense) and Ladino clover (Trifolium repens) plants showing phytoplasma-associated {{symptoms}} (yellowing/reddening, virescence and phyllody) {{have been}} recovered in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. Using AluI RFLP analysis of PCR amplified 16 S rDNA we showed that the disease can be caused independently by two phylogenetically distinct phytoplasmas. One of them showed the very typical 16 S rDNA RFLP pattern of the agent of Clover Phyllody in Canada (CCPh). The 16 S rDNA of the other phytoplasma (<b>Italian</b> <b>Clover</b> Phyllody phytoplasma, ICPhp) has been PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequence revealed high similarity (> 98 %) with phytoplasmas belonging to the X disease cluster, which includes organisms not reported to cause phyllody on their hosts. The analysis by AluI RFLP of the PCR amplified pathogen 16 S rDNA from other herbaceous plants (Crepis biennis, Taraxacum officinale, Leucanthemum vulgare) collected nearby with phytoplasma-associated symptoms showed similar patterns. Southern blot hybridization of their EcoRI digested total DNA revealed identical RFLP patterns, suggesting that the causative agent may be the same organism...|$|E

40|$|Within a {{schedule}} of long-term organic forage crop rotations, two mixed stands of ryegrass-clover were evaluated as following crops after winter cereal-legume mixtures under different sowing and tillage methods in Asturias (N. Spain). Significant {{differences were found in}} productivity, sward components, chemical composition and in growth dynamics. The crop sequence perennial ryegrass-white clover established under a triticale-field bean canopy produced an additional 6 t DM/ha, compared with oat-vetch followed by <b>Italian</b> ryegrass-red <b>clover</b> under regular post-harvest sowing, thus being a promising method for improving organic forage productions with minimum tillage. Changes in productivity and feeding values observed for both these ryegrass-clover swards along different growth periods were studied together with soil nutrient evolution and seasonal climatic fluctuations. Correlation analysis showed ecophysiological links among crop, soil and climate variables...|$|R
40|$|A mixture {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Lincoln University to investigate if mixtures of <b>Italian</b> ryegrass, red <b>clover</b> and balansa clover gave more high quality forage and suppressed weeds better than Italian ryegrass monocultures. Thirteen seed mixtures with varied species proportions were sown at 20 and 30 kg/ ha in March 2011. The minimum amount of Italian ryegrass was 50 % of the total sowing rate. Plots were harvested six times over 12 months and were neither irrigated nor fertilised. Inclusion of red clover increased yield by 41 % compared with the Italian ryegrass monocultures (13. 79 vs. 9. 75 t DM/ha), and provided effective weed suppression (< 5 % of total annual yield) and high quality forage (17. 5 % crude protein, 11. 3 MJ/ kg DM metabolisable energy). No benefits were gained from mixing balansa <b>clover</b> with <b>Italian</b> ryegrass. The optimum seed mixture was 12 kg/ha of Italian ryegrass, 8 kg/ha of red clover and no balansa clover...|$|R
40|$|The {{green crop}} drying {{industry}} in Denmark uses <b>Italian</b> rye grass, <b>clover,</b> and alfalfa {{as raw materials}} {{for the production of}} green pellets. The green crop drying industry solves its energy economical problems by heating and pressing of the green crop before drying. The produced sidestream is called brown juice. Brown juice was shown to be an excellent medium for lactic acid fermentation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the utilisation of brown juice in the production of polylactic acid, where wheat starch would be added to increase the lactic acid yield and, thus, the feasibility of the process. A number of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria have been identified, and in this work, six different strains were tested for their ability to produce alpha-amylase and to utilise all sugars with high lactic acid yield in a medium with a complex composition of free sugars (brown juice) and starch. Lactobacillus plantarum A 6 was the only strain that showed both a good lactic acid production and utilisation of starch in this medium. The growth rate of this strain was approximately 0. 4 h(- 1) and the lactic acid yield was 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|Annicchiarico, P., Collins, R. P., Fornasier, F., Rhodes, I. (2001). Variation in cold {{tolerance}} and spring growth among <b>Italian</b> white <b>clover</b> populations. Euphytica, 122, (2), 407 - 416. Seven populations collected at different altitudes in northern Italy, two Ladino breeding populations and two control cultivars (AberHerald and Grasslands Huia) of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{were included in}} a series of experiments analysing: (i) levels of cold tolerance using artificial and field-based methods; (ii) relationships between these measures of cold tolerance; (iii) components of spring yield, various physiological traits, and their relationships with cold tolerance. Rates of seedling and growing point mortality in the populations over winter, assessed in separate field experiments, were closely related (r = 0. 85). Grasslands Huia showed the highest death rates, and material originating from high altitudes the lowest. The LT 50 value, i. e., the temperature at which 50 % of the growing points would die, estimated by an artificial freezing test, was significantly correlated with field-based measures of seedling (r = 0. 64) and growing point (r = 0. 84) mortality. The existence of these correlations is of potential interest for the development of indirect selection criteria for complex and expensive-to-evaluate traits such as winter survival in field plots. Besides being reliable, in this study the artificial assessment was also sensitive, providing a greater degree of separation of the populations means than field-based measures. Of the several physiological traits (water content,concentrations of water soluble and total non-structural carbohydrate, and water soluble protein content of stolons) measured at a mid-winter sampling date under field conditions, the only character showing significant variation between populations was soluble protein content. There was a slight trend for material with a higher protein content to exhibit greater field-based values of cold tolerance. High altitude populations tended to have low spring yields. The highest spring yield was found in one of the Ladino populations. The study identified two populations which combined, to differing extents, cold {{tolerance and}} spring yield characteristics that would be of potential use in breeding for specified agronomic/climatic zones.

40|$|Annual {{forage crops}} have great {{importance}} for sustaining animal production in southern Italy. Knowledge {{of the performance of}} legume-grass associations under management similar to systems encountered in farm practice is es-sential for their effective exploitation of the available environmental resources. The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the effects of five cutting managements on the productivity and botanical composition of ten an-nual fodder crop mixtures in two Mediterranean environments. Ten ternary combinations of one grass (Avena sati-va L., oat and Lolium multiflorum Lam., <b>Italian</b> ryegrass), one <b>clover</b> (Trifolium alexandrinum L., berseem; Trifoli-um incarnatum L., crimson and Trifolium squarrosum L., squarrosum) or burr medic (Medicago polymorpha L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) were compared in a field trial (split-plot design, 3 replicates) in two locations (Cagliari and Foggia, Italy) during the 2000 - 2001 growing season. The cutting treatments included a winter grazing simulation (G), a cutting only regime at early (EF) or late flowering (F) of legumes and a combination of treat-ments (GEF and GF). Plant density (no. m- 2) prior to cutting, dry matter yield (g m- 2) and botanical composition (%) were evaluated. Considerable differences were observed in the harvestable dry matter yields of mixtures among cutting treatments in both localities, with treatment F showing the higher values (787. 1 and 415. 7 g m- 2 for Cagliari and Foggia, respectively). The forage species were able to compete and establish good growth during their initia...|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{controls}} perennial weeds, such as Elymus repens, {{partly because}} it fragments their underground storage organs. However, tillage is difficult to combine with a growing crop, which limits its application. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how soil vertical cutting with minimum soil disturbance and mowing affect the growth and competitive ability of E. repens in a grass–clover crop. A tractor-drawn prototype with vertical disks was used to fragment E. repens rhizomes with minimal soil and crop disturbance. In experiments performed in 2014 and 2015 at a field site close to Uppsala, Sweden, the rhizomes were fragmented before crop sowing (ERF), during crop growth (LRF), or both (ERF+LRF). Fragmentation was combined with repeated mowing (yes/no) and four companion crop treatments (none, <b>Italian</b> ryegrass, white <b>clover,</b> and grass/clover mixture). The results showed that in the grass–clover crop, rhizome fragmentation reduced E. repens rhizome biomass production and increased Italian ryegrass shoot biomass. ERF and LRF both reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 38 % compared with the control, while ERF+LRF reduced it by 63 %. Italian ryegrass shoot biomass was increased by 78 % by ERF, 170 % by LRF and 200 % by ERF+LRF. Repeated mowing throughout the experiment reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 75 %. Combining repeated mowing with rhizome fragmentation did not significantly increase the control effect compared to mowing alone. We concluded that rhizome fragmentation using vertical disks can be used both before sowing and during crop growth to enhance the controlling effect of grass–clover crops on E. repens...|$|R
40|$|Outcome: •	Reduction of soil erosion, given a good development. •	Suppression of seed-propagated weeds. •	Better {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the}} soil during harvest. •	Fixation of nitrogen thanks to the legumes, and utilisation of nutrients in the soil after maize harvest. •	Grazing possible immediately after maize harvest. Inconveniences: •	Competition for water {{in the case of}} severe drought. •	Cost of seeds. How to proceed: •	Sow the maize at the beginning of May. •	If possible, harrow a first time before appearance of the maize plants (blind harrowing). Second harrowing should take place at a plant height of 10 cm, when the maize plants are well rooted. Between a plant size of 10 to 20 cm a first hoeing should take place. •	Apply liquid manure at 25 - 30 m 3 per ha. •	When the maize plants reach a height of about 20 to 30 cm (from 4 - to 6 -leaf stage), undertake a second hoeing. Combine the second hoeing with simultaneous sowing of the catch crop into the weed-free crop. •	Recommended pure crops/crop mixtures: - Pure-clover crop: small-leaved white clover, hop clover, red clover (200 g/a) or sub clover (300 g/a). White clover and hop clover are less competitive than red clover or sub <b>clover.</b> Attention: Egyptian, <b>Italian</b> and Persian <b>clover</b> are normally too competitive. - Clover-mixtures are less risky: E. g. sub clover/red clover (at a mixing ratio of 5 : 2, a total of 300 g/a) or white clover/hop clover 1 : 1, a total of 200 g/a. - For farms with livestock, mixtures of grass and clover are an option. They can be used for grazing in autumn: E. g. white clover/smooth meadow-grass or meadow fescue or ryegrass (at a mixing ratio of 1 : 1, a total of about 250 g/a). Attention: ryegrass can be too competitive depending on the weather conditions. Tips: •	If possible, sow before a longer precipitation period. •	Sowing of catch crops is only successful until the maize reaches a height of around 30 cm. Late sowings are strongly suppressed by shading of the crop and cannot properly develop. •	During long drought periods, competition for water and nutrients can impair the development of the catch crop or, if the catch crop grows too lush, the development of the maize. •	In the case of the presence of root spreading weeds like docks and couch grass, a catch crop is not recommended, as this would require tillage after the maize harvest. •	The catch crop is only profitable if it remains for the duration of winter. Depending on its development and use, it could also be utilised in the following summer. If it is incorporated into the soil in spring, it has a high value as a green manure crop...|$|R
