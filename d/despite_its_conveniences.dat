40|$|Seismic {{tomography}} is now {{a common}} approach to estimating velocity structure of the Earth, {{regardless of whether the}} data sources are earthquake recordings or controlled sources such as explosions, airguns or Vibroseis. Seismic tomography is convenient to implement because it requires little to no a priori knowledge of Earth structure and is much less time consuming than forward modeling schemes. <b>Despite</b> <b>its</b> <b>convenience,</b> the method still lacks satisfactory quantitative assessments of model reliability. Here we explore the viability of applying travel-time sensitivity testing that uses a modified Cauchy distribution as its statistical foundation to assessing the uncertainty in velocity models produced with seismic tomography. Using a crustal refraction survey as a test data set, we find that this approach produces a more realistic estimate of the velocity uncertainty than does either a resampling approach or travel-time sensitivity testing that uses a Gaussian distribution as its statistical foundation. The velocity uncertainty estimates provide an important complement to other estimates of model reliability including checkerboard tests...|$|R
40|$|The pupil {{diameter}} is {{a widely}} studied cognitive load measure, which, <b>despite</b> <b>its</b> <b>convenience</b> for non-intrusive operator state monitoring in complex environments, is still not available for in situ measurements because of numerous methodological limitations. The {{most important of these}} limitations is the influence of the pupillary light reflex. Hence, there is the need of providing a pupil-based cognitive load measure independent of light conditions. In this paper, we present a promising technique of pupillary signal analysis resulting in luminance-independent measure of mental effort {{that could be used in}} real-time without a priori on luminous conditions. Twenty two participants performed a short-term memory task under different screen luminance conditions. Our results showed that the amplitude of pupil dilation due to load on memory is luminance-dependent with higher amplitude corresponding to low-luminance condition. Furthermore, our experimentation showed that the load on memory and luminance factors express themselves differently according to frequency. Therefore, as our statistical analysis revealed, the ratio between low (0 – 1. 6 Hz) and high frequency (1. 6 – 4 Hz) bands (LF/HF ratio) of power spectral densities of pupillary signal is sensitive to the cognitive load but not to luminance. This result is promising for the measurements of load on memory in ecological settings...|$|R

40|$|Background: The banking {{industry}} globally provides Internet banking {{to offer their}} customers easy access to banking services. The banks in South Africa, like their counterparts {{in other parts of}} the world, offer Internet banking to customers. However, the majority of South Africans in rural areas do not adopt and use Internet banking <b>despite</b> <b>its</b> <b>convenience,</b> the availability of Internet banking infrastructure, the effort of banks in promoting Internet banking awareness and Internet security. Objectives: This research investigated factors which influence the adoption and use of Internet banking in the context of South African rural areas. Method: In this study, a quantitative research approach was used. Data were collected through questionnaires and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) tool. Results: The perceived compatibility, trialability and external variables such as awareness and security were found to have significant influence in the adoption of Internet banking in South African rural areas, whereas relative advantage was found not to be a significant factor. Security and the complexity of Internet banking were also revealed as some of the factors hampering the intention to adopt Internet banking in South African rural areas. Conclusion: The lack of awareness on Internet banking services and its benefits such as <b>its</b> <b>convenience</b> and the possibility to conduct banking transactions from any location with Internet is found to be the reason for South African rural area retail bank consumers’ reluctance to adopt Internet banking. The majority of retail bank customers in South African rural areas do not use Internet banking because of the lack of resources, such as computers with Internet access. The security of transactions conducted over the Internet is the main concern and significant element that customers consider before adopting Internet banking in South African rural areas as they perceive it as being easily exposed to fraud. As a result, this perception erodes retail bank customers’ confidence to adopt Internet banking. The majority of retail bank customers in South African rural areas will be willing to adopt Internet banking if their lifestyle, values and specific need are met. Retail bank customers in South African rural areas will adopt Internet banking if the Internet banking processes are simplified and user-friendly. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>its</b> <b>convenience,</b> {{the process}} of self-report in {{personality}} testing can be impacted {{by a variety of}} cognitive and perceptual biases. One bias that violates local independence, a core criterion of modern test theory, is the order effect. In this bias, characteristics of an item response are impacted not only by the content of the current item but also the accumulated exposure to previous, similar-content items. This bias is manifested as increasingly stable item responses for items that appear later in a test. Previous investigations of this effect have been rooted in classical test theory (CTT) and have consistently found that item reliabilities, or corrected item-total score correlations, increase with the item's serial position in the test. The purpose of the current study was to more rigorously examine order effects via item response theory (IRT). To this end, the FACETS modeling approach (Linacre, 1989) was combined with the Generalized Partial Credit model (GPCM; Muraki, 1992) to produce a new model, the Generalized Partial Credit FACETS model (GPCFM). Serial position of an item serves as a facet that contributes to the item response, not only via its impact on an item's location on the latent trait continuum, but also its discrimination. Thus, the GPCFM differs from previous generalizations of the FACETS model (Wang&Liu, 2007) in that the item discrimination parameter is modified to include a serial position effect. This parameter is important because it reflects {{the extent to which the}} purported underlying trait is represented in an item score. Two sets of analyses were conducted. First, a simulation study demonstrated effective parameter recovery, though measurements of error were impacted by sample size for all parameters, test length for trait level estimates, and the size of the order effect for trait level estimates, and an interaction between sample size and test length for item discrimination. Secondly, with respect to real self-report personality data, the GPCFM demonstrated good fit as well as superior fit relative to competing, nested models while also identifying order effects in some traits, particularly Neuroticism, Openness, and Agreeableness.

40|$|Free Paper Session: Risk {{factors and}} {{management}} of upper GI bleedingDabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is the first new oral anticoagulant available {{as an alternative to}} warfarin. <b>Despite</b> <b>its</b> <b>convenience</b> and superiority over warfarin in the prevention of stroke and thromboembolism, recent studies suggested an increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients treated with dabigatran when compared to warfarin. These data were however largely derived from clinical trials in selected patient population. AIMS & METHODS: This study determined the risk of dabigatran associated GIB and the role of gastroprotective agents, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs), in preventing dabigatran related GIB in a population-based retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from the central database of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, which is the provider of all public medical services to 7 million populations. We identified all patients who were newly prescribed with dabigatran between Jan 2010 and Dec 2013. The primary endpoint is the onset of clinical GIB. Multivariate analysis was used to characterize the risk of GIB after adjusting for baseline patient’s characteristics, medical illnesses and concurrent medications. RESULTS: 5, 041 patients, who were newly prescribed dabigatran, were included in the analysis. Among them, 222 (4. 4 %) patients developed GIB with a median time to bleeding of 97 (IQR 262) days. Patients who were aged ≥ 75 years (OR 1. 83; 95 % CI, 1. 36 to 2. 47), had prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic embolic events (OR 1. 62; 1. 19 to 2. 2), and a prior history of peptic ulcer or GIB (OR 2. 48; 1. 81 to 3. 39) were found to have higher risks of GIB. Concurrent use of gastroprotective agents (OR 0. 61; 0. 44 - 0. 84; log rank test P = 0. 018) or statin (OR: 0. 58; 0. 43 - 0. 78) reduced the likelihood of GIB. Subcategory analysis showed that the use of either PPIs (OR 0. 70; 0. 51 - 0. 98) or H 2 RAs (OR 0. 67; 0. 50 - 0. 90) significantly lowered the bleeding risk. The risk reduction by gastroprotective agents was significant only in patients with prior history of ulcers or GIB (OR 0. 24; 0. 14 to 0. 43) but not in patients with no prior history (OR 0. 83; 0. 56 to 1. 21). CONCLUSION: The risk of GIB associated with dabigatran use in real life clinical settings is 4. 4 %. The use of gastroprotective agents significantly reduced the risk of dabigatran related GIB, particularly in high-risk patients with prior history of peptic ulcer or GIB...|$|R
40|$|The decoy-state {{scheme is}} the most widely {{implemented}} quantum key distribution protocol in practice. In order {{to account for the}} finite-size key effects on the achievable secret key generation rate, a rigorous statistical fluctuation analysis is required. Originally, a heuristic Gaussian-approximation technique was used for this purpose, which, <b>despite</b> of <b>its</b> analytical <b>convenience,</b> was not sufficiently rigorous. The fluctuation analysis has recently been made rigorous by using the Chernoff bound. There is a considerable gap, however, between the key rate bounds obtained from these new techniques and that obtained from the Gaussian assumption. Here, we develop a tighter bound for the decoy-state method, which yields a smaller failure probability. This improvement results in a higher key rate and increases the maximum distance over which secure key exchange is possible. By optimizing the system parameters, our simulation results show that our new method almost closes the gap between the two previously proposed techniques and achieves a similar performance to that of conventional Gaussian approximations.

40|$|An accelerated-testing {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for measuring the slow-crack-growth (SCG) behavior of brittle materials. Like the prior methodology, the accelerated-testing methodology involves dynamic fatigue (constant stress-rate) testing, in which a load or a displacement is applied to a specimen at a constant rate. SCG parameters or life prediction parameters needed for designing components made of the same material {{as that of the}} specimen are calculated from the relationship between (1) the strength of the material as measured in the test and (2) the applied stress rate used in the test. <b>Despite</b> <b>its</b> simplicity and <b>convenience,</b> dynamic fatigue testing as practiced heretofore has one major drawback: it is extremely time-consuming, especially at low stress rates. The present accelerated methodology reduces the time needed to test a specimen at a given rate of applied load, stress, or displacement. Instead of starting the test from zero applied load or displacement as in the prior methodology, one preloads the specimen and increases the applied load at the specified rate (see Figure 1). One might expect the preload to alter the results of the test and indeed it does, but fortunately, it is possible to account for the effect of the preload in interpreting the results. The accounting is done by calculating the normalized strength (defined as the strength in the presence of preload the strength in the absence of preload) as a function of (1) the preloading factor (defined as the preload stress the strength in the absence of preload) and (2) a SCG parameter, denoted n, that is used in a power-law crack-speed formulation.
