5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 fitting out and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be ready for action, and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet until 1 March 1909, when she was {{withdrawn}} {{for use as a}} torpedo training ship. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was again placed in active service with the cruiser division <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. In October 1914, Friedrich Carl was the first German warship to carry seaplanes. The ship carried two planes provisionally and had no permanent modifications made to support them. She was made the flagship of Rear Admiral Behring, the commander of the German cruiser squadron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. The German naval command was aware that British submarines were operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea, and so ordered Behring to attack the Russian port at Libau to prevent it from being used as a British submarine base.|$|E

5|$|Z38 was a Type 1936A (Mob) {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in 1941, and completed two years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was modified heavily under Project Barbara. She served with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla her entire time under German service, and {{spent much of her}} life escorting escorting task forces, patrolling areas of sea, laying mines, or bombarding land forces. She served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> briefly in 1943, before being reassigned to the Arctic area around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and then serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> again in 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{training}} with the 8th U-boat Flotilla, based at Königsberg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea, U-255 {{was transferred to the}} 11th U-boat Flotilla, based at Bergen, Western Norway, for front-line service on 1 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Schwaben {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the German Bight—usually stationed in the mouth of the Elbe—and for operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Schwaben, was transferred to support the German Army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea area. Schwaben and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, KAdm Alberts.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German Navy; Prinz Adalbert {{was used as}} a gunnery training ship for her entire peacetime career, while Friedrich Carl served with the fleet until 1909, when she was withdrawn to act as a torpedo training vessel. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, both vessels were mobilized and assigned to the cruiser squadron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> Friedrich Carl was sunk by Russian naval mines off Memel in November 1914, though most of her crew was safely evacuated. Prinz Adalbert was torpedoed twice by British submarines operating in the Baltic; the first, on 1 July 1915, caused serious damage that was ultimately repaired. The second, on 23 October 1915, caused a catastrophic explosion in the ship's ammunition magazines that destroyed the vessel. Six hundred and seventy-two men were killed, the greatest single loss of life for the German Navy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> during the war.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having been}} forced to flee, Jachmann was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} rear admiral for his actions during the battle. The Prussians made several further patrols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> but refused to seek a pitched engagement with the far superior Danish fleet. Instead, the Second Schleswig War was decided on land. Additionally, the arrival of an Austrian squadron in the North Sea allowed the Austrians and Prussians to break the Danish blockade of the North Sea coastal ports at the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May. The Austrians, fearing that a more aggressive operation to defeat the Danish fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> would provoke the British, kept their squadron in the North Sea {{for the remainder of the}} war. On 9 May, the two sides signed an armistice in London that took effect three days later, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The Austrian and Prussian naval forces in the North Sea supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June. Ultimately, Denmark sued for peace after it became clear that they had lost naval superiority and that Britain would not intervene in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea from 29 until 31 May which ended without combat. The ship covered a minelaying {{operation}} on 11–12 September off Texel. Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23–24 October. Grosser Kurfürst ended the year with a two-week training cruise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> which lasted from 5 to 20 December. Another round of exercises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> followed on 18–23 January 1916. Grosser Kurfürst went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance on 12 February. Work lasted until 3 March; two days later the ship sailed for a sweep into the Hoofden, though this again failed to encounter any British forces. The fleet conducted another sortie on 23 March to the Amrun Bank, followed by another a month later to Horns Reef on 21–22 April.|$|E

5|$|In May 1719, Balchen {{was given}} {{command of the}} 70-gun HMS Monmouth under Sir John Norris, and served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> and North Seas until 1722. In 1722, Balchen took over the {{guardship}} HMS Ipswich at Spithead and, in 1726, returned to the Monmouth for further service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> under Norris and Sir Charles Wager. In 1727 Balchen {{was part of a}} mission to resupply besieged Gibraltar, although, by the time the fleet arrived, the siege had been broken. In 1728, Balchen received promotion to Rear-Admiral. In 1731, after a period in command of the 60-gun HMS Dreadnought, Balchen took over the 80-gun HMS Princess Amelia and commanded her in support of a Spanish landing at Livorno. Balchen returned in December and, in 1734, was promoted to Vice-Admiral, spending the next five years at his estates in England.|$|E
5|$|König {{remained}} in port until 21 October, {{when the ship}} was again sent to the Baltic for training. The ship returned to the fleet on 3 November. König {{and the rest of}} IIISquadron then steamed out to Horns Reef on 5–6 November. König was then assigned various tasks, including guard duty in the German Bight and convoy escort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> 1917 saw several training missions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> during 22 February– 4 March; 14–22 March and 17 May– 9 June. König then went into Wilhelmshaven for maintenance on 16 June. The installation of a new heavy foremast and other work lasted until 21 July. On 10 September, König again went into the Baltic for training maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} Preussen, Lothringen missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, though for {{different}} reasons. Preussen had been temporarily transferred to guard duties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic,</b> while Lothringen {{was in such}} poor condition that Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, removed her from the squadron. Jutland proved to Scheer that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable {{to take part in}} a major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. Lothringen became a guard ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> after she left the battle fleet. The following year she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where she was used as an exercise ship, as well as to train engineers. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in 1918.|$|E

5|$|On 17 September 1909, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{decommissioned}} {{and assigned}} to the Reserve Division <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. By that time, the new dreadnought battleships, which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete, were beginning to come into service with the fleet. In early 1910, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{assigned to the}} Training Squadron, which operated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> in April. She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September, she was placed back in reserve. More modernization work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again {{to take part in the}} autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron. She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912.|$|E
5|$|Repairs were {{completed}} by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway {{to join the}} forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the Barents Sea with the heavy cruiser , which ended with a failure to destroy the convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul {{at the end of}} 1943, after which the ship remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Russian Tsar Peter the Great had {{established}} a new capital and powerful naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. Russian naval power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> grew to challenge the interests of Sweden, the other leading power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic.</b> Swedish holdings at that time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland {{and most of the}} Baltic states, a dominion depending on, and connected by, the Baltic Sea trade routes. During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Sweden lost all its territories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states and suffered Russian raids in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos stretching from the Gulf of Finland to Stockholm. The Swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels, beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean galleys. Most of these new vessels were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war with Russia (1741–43) and the minor involvement against Prussia in the Seven Years' War (1757–62) showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E

She saw limited duty in the North Sea as a guard ship and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea against Russian forces. The threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw from the Baltic in 1916. For the remainder of the war, Schwaben served as an engineering training ship for navy cadets.
