5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of <b>excluded</b> <b>middle</b> is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds.

Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of <b>excluded</b> <b>middle</b> with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{reflexive}} clitic se does not operate in the lexicon in French reflexive and reciprocal constructions (<b>excluding</b> <b>middles</b> and anticausatives). The widely held approaches to reflexives, in which the reflexive clitic creates a oneplace reflexive verb and/or absorbs a case feature on the verb, is both semantically inadequate and syntactically too local. The reflexive clitic appears with verbs and predicates that are independently semantically reflexive; French reflexive/reciprocal constructions are semantically transitive; and case absorption {{does not account for}} causative and applicative constructions. To account for the facts, it is proposed that se is a Voice head introducing in syntax the external argument of the verb, and stating that the referent of the object is determined on the basis of that of the subject...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study intends {{to reveal the}} extent to which Larung (2001), as a recent Indonesian novel, shows postmodern features, especially in its construction, concerning the worlds under erasure and the Chinese box worlds. The theory adopted in the study is that of postmodern fiction by Brian McHale. The method employed is semiotics by Hurshovsky. The theory and method are {{based on the assumption that}} postmodern fiction is ontological in nature. This is different from modern fiction, which is epistemological in nature. According to McHale, the ontological nature comprises zones, construction, words, and groundings. This study investigates, in particular, the construction in Larung. The research findings show that in Larung there are features classified by McHale into construction, covering the worlds under erasure and the Chinese box worlds. In the former, Larung explores the features proposed by McHale, namely something always happening, something always existing, <b>excluded</b> <b>middles,</b> forking paths, and a sense of a (non) ending. In the latter Larung also explores features proposed by McHale, namely moving toward infinite regression, trompe-l’oell, strange loops, characters in search of an author, abysmal fictions, and something real. However, in terms of moving toward infinite regression Larung shows opposite features; it does not narrate things backward continuously, but it moves backward and forward to the present. Therefore, Larung can be classified as novel with a postmodern construction...|$|R

25|$|A {{major force}} behind {{intuitionism}} was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain {{the law of the}} <b>excluded</b> <b>middle</b> and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis within this framework.|$|E
25|$|One {{especially}} difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic.

To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to his critique of standard logic, such as the law of contradiction and the law of the <b>excluded</b> <b>middle.</b> Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{variation in}} {{the impact of the}} Great Recession on economic stress across income classes for a range of advanced European countries. Our analysis shows Iceland, Ireland and Greece to be quite distinctive in terms of increases in their multidimensional income, material deprivation and economic stress profiles. Between 2008 and 2012 these countries moved from being predictably located within anticipated welfare regimes to becoming clear outliers. For this set of counties, each of which was exposed to different but severe forms of economic shock, trends in income class polarisation versus middle class squeeze were variable. Each exhibited substantial increases in levels of economic stress. However, changes in the pattern of income class differentiation were somewhat different. In Iceland a form of middle class squeeze was observed. For income class polarization did not <b>exclude</b> <b>middle</b> class squeeze. Greece came closest to fitting the polarization profile. Changes in the distribution of household equivalent income had no effect on stress levels once the impact of material deprivation was taken into account. Changes in levels of material deprivation {{played a significant role in}} accounting for changing stress levels but only for the three lowest income classes. These findings bring out the extent to which the impact of the Great Recession on the distribution of economic stress across classes varied even among the hardest-hit countries. They also serve to highlight the advantages of a multidimensional approach that goes beyond reliance on income in seeking to understand the impact of such shocks...|$|R
