500|$|Character {{relationships}} form a {{core part}} of battle, and include both optional Supports conversations and story-driven character romances. Support conversations see selected {{characters in the}} home base talking with each other, and romances are triggered by the story when certain characters have joined the party during the first generation storyline. The second <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> has its class influenced by the assigned classes of its parents, in addition to stat values and personal skills. Second generation units can also form optional romantic attachments, but this only influences stats. When characters with strong Support or romantic connection are next to each other, they grant stat boosts to each other, which can improve range, attack power or agility. In addition to normal stat growth and Supports, different high-ranking units on both sides have a separate [...] "Commander" [...] rank, which grants stat boosts to all units within range, with the boost varying depending on that unit's current Command rank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Cascaded on-load {{tap changers}} (OLTC) {{are widely used}} for coarse voltage control in {{electric}} power systems. There could be an interaction between load dynamics and OLTC control under certain system operating conditions which may lead to OLTC limit cycle phenomena thereby resulting into long term voltage oscillations in the system. In the recent years, renewable and non-renewable local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> have been getting interconnected in modern power systems. The existence of OLTC limit cycles {{in the presence of}} local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> has not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, the OLTC limit cycle phenomena, which can occur due to interactions among load-voltage dynamics, OLTC controls and the local generation, has been investigated. Also, a strategy is proposed for mitigating the power system oscillations which can be induced by OLTC limit cycles, especially with local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> in the network. The proposed mitigation strategy including detailed investigations and analyses have been verified for a two-bus system, and successfully tested on a multi-bus system with local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> usin...|$|R
