The most commonly used measure of life expectancy is at birth (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. Cohort LEB is the mean length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born many decades ago, so that all their members have died. Period LEB is the mean length of life of a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, [...] to the mortality rates observed at a given year.|$|E

40|$|Object The {{annual rate}} of rupture of {{intracranial}} aneurysms is often assumed to be constant, but it is unknown whether this assumption is true. Recent case reports have suggested that aneurysms grow fast {{in a short period}} of time. The authors of the present report investigated the plausibility of a constant growth rate for intracranial aneurysms. Methods Assuming a constant aneurysm growth rate within an individual and varying rates between individuals, a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> was simulated. Individuals with high growth rates will display aneurysm formation and rupture at a young age; such persons disappear early from the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort.</b> As a result the mean lesion growth rate varies over time. In hypothetical cohorts with different initial mean growth rates, the authors calculated age-specific incidence rates (per 100, 000 person-years) of subarachnoid hemorrhage and compared these rates with population-based data on the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (per 100, 000 person-years). Results A <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> with a mean initial growth rate of 0. 18 mm/year reproduced most closely the incidence rates observed in the population. However, even for this most plausible <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort,</b> age-specific incidence rates in the model differed substantially and statistically significantly from those observed in the population. Conclusions Based on the results of this study, it is unlikely that intracranial aneurysms in general grow at a constant time-independent rate. The authors hypothesized that the actual growth process is irregular and discontinuous, which results in periods with and without aneurysm growth and with high and low risks of rupture...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{are over}} 40 000 ischaemic strokes {{annually}} in Canada, which result in significant morbidity, mortality and burden to the healthcare system. A recent, large clinical trial has evaluated {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) intravenously {{for the treatment of}} acute ischaemic stroke with promising outcomes but with an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Objective: To compare clinical and economic outcomes of intravenous t-PA therapy (0. 9 mg/kg, to a maximum of 90 mg, initiated within 3 hours of stroke onset) versus no t-PA for acute ischaemic stroke based on the outcomes achieved in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial. Design: A Markov model depicting the natural lifetime course after an initial acute ischaemic stroke. On the basis of this model, a simulated trial compared no t-PA with t-PA. Patients: A <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> of 1000 patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Study perspective: Canadian healthcare system. Outcome measures: Total acute stroke and post-stroke treatment costs and cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: For a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> of 1000 patients, the estimated lifetime stroke costs were 103 100 000 Canadian dollars ($Can) [1999 values) in the t-PA arm ($Can 103 100 per patient) compared with $Can 106 900 000 in the no t-PA arm ($Can 106 900 per patient), yielding a lifetime cost difference of $Can 3 800 000 in favour of t-PA versus no t-PA ($Can 3800 per patient). In the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort,</b> t-PA treatment resulted in 13 130 QALYs versus 9670 QALYs with no t-PA treatment. This translated into a net benefit of 3460 additional QALYs per 1000 patients (3. 46 QALYs per patient). No treatment, outcome or economic variables influenced the model outcome. Conclusion: From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with intravenous t-PA is an economically attractive strategy.

40|$|The {{management}} of asymptomatic cholelithiasis {{in patients with}} diabetes is controversial. We used decision analysis to compare expectant management to prophylactic cholecys-tectomy in asymptomatic diabetic patients. Relevant proba-bilities were derived from the literature or expert opinion. <b>Hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of patients were followed for their life-times under each strategy. Expectant management was al-most always the superior course. For example, a 30 -year-old diabetic man gains an average of 6. 1 months of life by choos-ing expectant management over prophylactic surgery. The superiority of expectant management was invariant to changes in age, sex, {{and the extent to}} which major surgical complications affect the future quality of life. Prophylactic cholecystectomy was superior only with extremely high esti-mates of the likelihood of developing symptomatic disease, the probability of requiring emergency surgery after symp-toms develop, and emergency surgical mortality rates. How-ever, no single factor had sufficient impact to alter the opti-mal decision by itself; the probabilities of several untoward events had to be increased simultaneously to favor prophy-lactic cholecystectomy.

40|$|The {{association}} between the response proportion in epidemiologic studies and nonresponse bias is complicated, because exposure prevalences and misclassification errors may vary by recruitment wave. In this paper, the authors illustrate the effect of varying degrees of wave-specific nondifferential exposure measurement error in a dichotomous exposure on the relative risk in a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> study of 5, 000 participants, by recruitment wave. The field phase of the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> study consisted of five consecutive recruitment waves. The authors assigned response proportions to each wave (wave 1 : 30 %; wave 2 : 10 %; wave 3 : 10 %; wave 4 : 30 %; wave 5 : 20 %) and studied three different wave-specific patterns of true exposure prevalence: 1) the true exposure prevalence remains the same in all waves; 2) the true exposure prevalence increases by wave; and 3) the true exposure prevalence decreases by wave. The authors assumed three corresponding patterns of nondifferential misclassification error in exposure status across waves. If the nondifferential exposure misclassification increases by wave, the cumulative relative risk estimate is increasingly biased towards the null. This bias is intensified if the true exposure prevalence increases by wave. Studies with low response proportions may be less biased than studies with high response proportions if the nondifferential misclassification error in a dichotomous exposure increases by recruitment wave. bias (epidemiology); data collection; data interpretation, statistical; epidemiologic measurement; epidemiologi...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) are now {{available}} alternatives to tuberculin skin testing (TST) for detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We compared the cost-effectiveness of TST and IGRA in dif-ferent populations and clinical situations, and with vari-ation {{of a number of}} parameters. METHODS: Markov modelling was used to compare ex-pected TB cases and costs over 20 years following screen-ing for TB with different strategies among <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of foreign-born entrants to Canada, or contacts of TB cases. The less expensive commercial IGRA, Quanti-FERON®-TB Gold (QFT), was examined. Model inputs were derived from published literature. RESULTS: For entering immigrants, screening with chest radiograph (CXR) would be the most and QFT the least cost-effective. Sequential screening with TST then QFT was more cost-effective than QFT alone in all scenarios, and more cost-effective than TST alone in selected sub-groups. Among close and casual contacts, screening with TST or QFT would be cost saving; savings with TST would be greater than with QFT, except in contacts who were bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinated after infancy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for LTBI, with TST or QFT, is cost-effective only if the risk of disease is high. The most cost-effective use of QFT is to test TST-positive persons.

The incremental cost-effectiveness of intermittent screening and treatment (ISTp) with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as an alternative strategy to IPTp-SP was estimated followed by a simulation of the effects on cost-effectiveness of decreasing efficacy of IPTp-SP due to SP resistance. The analysis was based on results from a multi-centre, non-inferiority trial conducted in West Africa. METHODS A decision tree model was analysed from a health provider perspective. Model parameters for all trial countries with appropriate ranges and distributions were used in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Simulations were performed in <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of 1000 pregnant women who received either ISTp-AL or IPTp-SP. In addition a cost-consequences analysis was conducted. Trial estimates were used to calculate disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) for low birth weight and severe/moderate anaemia (both shown to be non-inferior for ISTp-AL) and clinical malaria (inferior for ISTp-AL). Cost estimates were obtained from observational studies, health facility costings and public procurement databases. Results were calculated as incremental cost per DALY averted. Finally, the cost-effectiveness changes with decreasing SP efficacy were explored by simulation.

In the base-case analysis conducted from the societal perspective, ten-year cumulative costs for the "dialysis only," CsA, and Aza cohorts were $ 181, $ 147, and $ 138 million, respectively. Transplantation using CsA rather than Aza would cost an estimated $ 19, 800 per additional life-year and $ 9, 700 per additional graft-year; whereas from Medicare’s perspective, CsA would be less costly than Aza. This analysis suggests that under present regulations, widespread use of CsA instead of Aza for cadaveric graft recipients would result in significant cost shifting from Medicare to the private sector; but from a societal perspective, this would result in no, or at worst, relatively inconsequential, additional health expenditures.

40|$|Background: To analyse the {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of traditional}} disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) compared to biological therapies {{from the perspective}} of Chinese society. Methodology/Principal Findings: A mathematical model was developed by incorporating the clinical trial data and Chinese unit costs and treatment sequences from a lifetime perspective. <b>Hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure–quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) –was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $ 77, 357. 7, $ 26, 562. 4 and $ 57, 838. 4 per QALY and $ 66, 422. 9, $ 28, 780. 6 and $ 50, 937. 6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China.

As a result, many healthcare centers report estimated GFR (eGFR) with routine blood work. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the cost-effectiveness of automatic eGFR reporting compared with reporting sCr alone. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: AMarkov model was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reporting eGFR compared with reporting sCr alone in a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> of 60 -yr-old individuals undergoing annual blood chemistry testing over 18 yr. Paths and path probabilities were identical between the two arms, except for the sensitivity and specificity of eGFR and sCr to detect CKD. Results: eGFR reporting was dominant with a cost/effectiveness ratio of $ 16, 751 /quality-adjusted life year (QALY) versus $ 16, 779 /QALY for sCr reporting. Monte Carlo microsimulations in a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> of 10, 000 patients demonstrated that over 18 yr, an average of 13 fewer deaths, 29 fewer ESRD events, and 11, 348 more false positive CKD (FP-CKD) cases occurred with eGFR reporting. A sensitivity analysis revealed that decreasing the FP-CKD quality of life by> 2 % rendered sCr reporting more cost-effective than eGFR reporting. If FP-CKD reduced quality of life by 5 %, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sCr reporting versus eGFR reporting would be $ 4367 /QALY. Conclusion: A decision analysis suggests that reporting eGFR may be beneficial, but this limited benefit was reversed wit...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the cost-utility of screening for depression compared with no screening Design. Nonstationary Markov model. Setting and participants. <b>Hypothetical</b> <b>cohort</b> of 40 -year-old primary care patients assigned to annual screening or no screening followed by usual care. Annual screening consist-ed of a self-administered questionnaire followed by assess-ment by {{a nurse and}} primary care provider. Other screening frequencies were explored, including screening at each visit (opportunistic screening); 1 -time screening; and screening every 2, 3, or 5 years. Patients were followed until age 90 years or death. Data analysis. The Markov model included 8 major health states: (1) never depressed, (2) history of depression in remis-sion, (3) history of depression still in treatment, (4) significan...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{studied the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of tenofovir and entecavir in e antigen positive (CHBe+) and negative (CHBe-) chronic hepatitis B. Methods: Using a multicenter survey including 544 patients we measured patient {{quality of life}} and attributable costs by clinical disease stage. Natural disease progression was studied in 278 patients in a single center. A Markov model was constructed to follow <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of treated and untreated 40 -year-old CHBe+ and CHBe- patients and 50 -year-old patients with compensated cirrhosis. Results: We did not find an improvement in quality of life when viral load was reduced under treatment. Transition rates to liver cirrhosis were found to be age-dependent. Assuming equal effectiveness, tenofovir dominates the entecavir strategy because of its lower price in Belgium. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of tenofovir after 20 years is more favorable for treating Caucasian cirrhotic patients (mean ICER € 29, 000 /quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) compared with treating non-cirrhotic patients (mean ICER € 110, 000 and 131, 000 /QALY for CHB e+ and e-, respectively). Within the non-cirrhotic patients the ICER decreases with increasing cohort starting age from 30 to 50 years. Conclusions: Results of long-term models for tenofovir or entecavir treatment of CHB need to be interpreted with caution as long-term trials with hard end points are lacking. Especially the effect on HCC remains highly uncertain. Based on cost-effectiveness considerations such antiviral treatment should be targeted at patients with cirrhosis or at risk of rapid progression to this disease stage. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Primary stroke centers (PSC) have {{demonstrated}} improved survival {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating AIS patients in a PSC compared with a nonPSC hospital setting. Methods—We developed a decision analytic model to project the lifetime outcomes and costs of 2 <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of 75 AIS patients. Clinical data were derived from a recent observational study comparing PSC- and nonPSC-admitted patients, clinical trials, longitudinal cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data were based on Medicare reimbursement and other published sources. We used a healthcare payer perspective, and the primary outcomes were incremental life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years, and healthcare costs. We performed sensitivity and scenario analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. Results—Admission to a PSC resulted in a gain of 0. 22 years of life (95 % credible range [CR], 0. 12 – 0. 33) and 0. 15 quality-adjusted life years (95 % CR, 0. 08 – 0. 23) per patient, at a cost of $ 3600 (95 % CR, $ 2400 –$ 5000) per patient, compared with admission to a nonPSC hospital. The incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year gained was $ 24 000, and all probabilistic simulation results were below the $ 100 000 /quality-adjusted life year threshold. In scenario analyses accounting for as few as 7 and as many as 500 AIS patients/year per PSC, cost-effectiveness improved as the number of AIS patients admitted per year increased...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the short term}} and long term cost effectiveness, from a healthcare perspective, associated {{with the introduction of}} lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B. Design: The analysis used a 2 -step modelling approach. A decision tree was used to estimate clinical outcomes and costs after 1 year. The 1 -year results were then extrapolated to 70 years using a Markov model. Patients: The study population comprised <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cohorts</b> of patients with chronic hepatitis B, representative of those likely to receive treatment in clinical practice in Australia. Main outcome measures and results: In the short term, more patients seroconverted when lamivudine was available, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3341 Australian dollars ($A) per additional seroconversion. In the long term, the introduction of lamivudine increased life expectancy by 3. 9 years [3. 2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ] compared with when interferon-alpha was the only treatment, or 4. 6 years (3. 8 QALYs) compared with no treatment. There were reductions in lifetime risk of developing compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma of 5, 11 and 11 %, respectively, when lamivudine was available. The incremental cost of having lamivudine available, as opposed to interferon-alpha only, was $A 633 per year of life saved or $A 735 per QALY. Conclusion: The introduction of lamivudine is expected to reduce and delay the progression of chronic hepatitis B, increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of patients for a small overall increase in healthcare costs.
