40|$|Abstract: It is a {{well-known}} fact that only over some time after a system release high availability numbers are possible to achieve in practice. The main question is {{how long does it}} take to achieve these numbers. This paper makes an attempt to come up with the answers. The problem of achieving high system reliability is addressed by analyzing relationships between integrated (HW and SW) system reliability and major system parameters, such as the system introduction rate into the marketplace, the annual system production volumes, the estimated number of bugs in each software subsystem, the number of software subsystems, the error generation rate during an attempt to correct bugs, the average time to test software before its <b>final</b> <b>release,</b> the average <b>time</b> to distribute software to customers, the average time for the customer to install and use the new software release. The obtained results of system reliability prediction presented as a function of time may be used to estimate the duration of the system testing before its release as well as to find the number of support personnel required for the timely response to possible customer problems. Key-Words:- Software reliability, software, reliability prediction, reliability estimates, computer systems...|$|R
