5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{know that}} there is a real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
25|$|From being a {{supporter}} of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> believe that the United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends {{and the rest of}} the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{the clear}} {{conclusion}} {{that there is}} no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|My Lords, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the {{conclusion}} that, {{as a matter}} of law, there are sound reasons for making a limited modification to the existing rule [...] unless there are constitutional or practical reasons which outweigh them.

[...] Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, [...] "Throw up your hands; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> disarm you!" [...] Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their six-shooters. Virgil yelled: [...] "Hold! I don't mean that!" [...] or [...] "Hold on, I don't want that!" [...] The single-action revolvers carried by both groups {{had to be}} cocked before firing.|$|E

500|$|In {{a recent}} {{editorial}} written by Bannon in Curve, she discussed how her books survived despite criticisms by censors, Victorian moralists, and purveyors of literary [...] "snobbery" [...] in writing, [...] "To the persistent surprise {{of many of}} us, and of the critics who found us such an easy target years ago, the books by, of and for women found {{a life of their}} own. They—and we—may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable 'nice' literature, as it were—but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> value that historical judgment. We wrote the stories no one else could tell. And in so doing, we captured a slice of life in a particular time and place that still resonates for members of our community." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia {{around the time of the}} 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|The single's {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. It reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 26 at the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song remains, to this day, an audience favorite in live performances. It {{has earned the}} band praise from critics. Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, wrote, [...] "'Shiver' has a vocal that could be Jeff Buckley influenced, the soaring vocals are a joy over a reasonably guitar rock based instrumental track." [...] A review by David DeVoe in Hybridmagazine.com reads, [...] "'Shiver' is a delightfully laid back tune, full of that great guitar sound that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> appreciate this band for." [...] Spencer Owen of Pitchfork noted, [...] "It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's {{the only one that}} blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's 'Grace.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the Hotel de l'Epee, exulting, joyous, and {{confident}} of victory. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> confess everything to her, and {{by virtue of}} what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done that confession was rendered easy. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> said to her: [...] "The woman whom I wagered to win was not you, Roxalanne, but a certain Mademoiselle de Lavedan. Your love <b>I</b> <b>have</b> won, but that you may foster no doubts of my intentions, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> paid my wager and acknowledge defeat. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made over to Chatellerault and to his heirs for all time my estates of Bardelys." ...|$|R

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a little hard to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E
500|$|Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, in his 1897 book Forty-one Years in India, gave an {{opposing}} view; Roberts {{stated that he}} doubted [...] "whether anything would have been gained" [...] by an attempt to pursue the mutineers as the cavalry available (the 6th Dragoon Guards) {{was at that time}} composed mainly of recruits with horses that had not yet been broken and it was impractical to follow the mutineers with either infantry or artillery. Roberts went on to say [...] "after careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at Meerut, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion {{that it would have been}} futile to have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of the mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering the state of feeling throughout the Native army, no action, however prompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the Mutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the British Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of time and opportunity." [...] The actions of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry themselves were described by Major Agha Amin, writing for Defence Journal, as [...] "a coup d'état and an outstanding example of initiative and courage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to the revelation, Nation {{gathered}} several rocks – [...] "smashers", {{she called}} them – {{and proceeded to}} Dobson's Saloon on June 7. Announcing [...] "Men, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> save you from a drunkard's fate", she began to destroy the saloon's stock with her cache of rocks. After she similarly destroyed two other saloons in Kiowa, a tornado hit eastern Kansas, which she took as divine approval of her actions.|$|E

60|$|The soft, drawling voice, {{the sleepy}} smile, the {{careless}} good-will all came back, utterly transforming the man. This was the Jim Williams <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> love. With a wrench I recovered myself.|$|R
2500|$|Billy Aronson said, [...] "For the record, {{although}} I was {{ambivalent about}} Jonathan’s ideas for Rent {{when we were}} working together on it, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> love the show. And as tragic as {{it is that he}} didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was born}} in the town of Manitowoc in the state of Wisconsin, one of the United States of America ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the city of Toronto from Houston, Texas, {{for the express purpose of}} enlisting and {{entering}} the Royal Flying Corps of the Canadian Army for service overseas.

2500|$|The telling {{point is}} that the [...] "mask" [...] of coolness is worn not only in time of stress, but also of pleasure, in fields of {{expressive}} performance and the dance. Struck by the re-occurrence of this vital notion elsewhere in tropical Africa and in the Black Americas, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> term the attitude [...] "an aesthetic of the cool" [...] {{in the sense of a}} deeply and completely motivated, consciously artistic, interweaving of elements serious and pleasurable, of responsibility and play.|$|E

2500|$|The Governor's {{main problem}} {{was with his}} own {{military}} officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant. Scurvy broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send Sirius to Cape Town for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip quoted [...] "The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cross {{asks his}} {{subjects}} [...] "Tell {{me how you}} feel about having autism", he elicits responses including: [...] "I have first thought, because people don't understand me", [...] "Over the years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> accept it as a part of who I am.

2500|$|When touring Europe {{with his}} music he said, [...] "I don't use folklore, I am the folklore" [...] (Eu sou o folclore) and [...] "I {{have not come}} to learn, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> show what I have made up to now" [...] (Ich bin nicht gekommen, um zu lernen, sondern um zu zeigen, was ich bisher gemacht habe), showing that he was quite aware of his unique {{position}} among classical composers, and he made good use of his origins to publicise his own works.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back.
