5000|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>rafter</b> (angle rafter): The rafter in {{the corners}} of a hip roof. The foot of a <b>hip</b> <b>rafter</b> lands on a dragon beam.|$|E
5000|$|Jack rafter, cripple rafter, cripple-jack rafter: A {{shortened}} rafter such as {{landing on}} a <b>hip</b> <b>rafter</b> or {{interrupted by a}} dormer.|$|E
50|$|The dragon beam lies {{parallel}} to and below a <b>hip</b> <b>rafter</b> and carries the rafter. The dragon beam is {{carried by the}} wall on the outer end and by a horizontal piece between the two walls on the inside end. There are conflicting usages for this term in the U.K. and U.S.A. (see below). The most common usage seems to be combination dragon beam/cross tie.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> {{per foot}} of run. The <b>hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> also connects the ridge to the plate, but lies at a 45-degree {{angle to the}} common rafter. This number gives {{the length of the}} <b>hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> per {{seventeen}} units of run.|$|R
50|$|The wider arm, {{two inches}} wide, {{is called the}} blade; the {{narrower}} arm, {{one and a half}} inches wide, the tongue. The square has many uses, including laying out common <b>rafters,</b> <b>hip</b> <b>rafters</b> and stairs. It has a diagonal scale, board foot scale and an octagonal scale. On the newer framing squares there are degree conversions for different pitches and fractional equivalents.|$|R
50|$|In {{collaboration}} {{with the city of}} Zürich, a 60 m high scaffolding tower was erected. The southwest side <b>hip</b> <b>rafters</b> of fir wood roof of the plant had moisture damage due to leaking roof shingles. It was plated with two dry, one year stored spruce wood parts, that were cope planed, glued together and the cross-sectional dimensions of wood connected with wooden screws. In addition to the general repairs to the structural stabilization of the first stator, the fixing of the rafter positions took was effected. Collar beam and strut pairs were cut off or removed in the roof structure.|$|R
5000|$|Hip roofs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to construct than a gabled roof, requiring more complex systems of <b>rafters</b> or trusses. <b>Hip</b> roofs can be constructed {{on a wide variety of}} plan shapes. Each ridge is central over the rectangle of the building below it. The triangular faces of the roof are called the hip ends, and they are bounded by the hips themselves. The [...] "hips" [...] and <b>hip</b> <b>rafters</b> sit on an external corner of the building and rise to the ridge. Where the building has an internal corner, a valley makes the join between the sloping surfaces. They have the advantage of giving a compact, solid appearance to a structure. The roof pitch (slope) may vary.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] <b>Hip</b> and valley <b>rafters</b> use {{seventeen}} as {{the common}} reference for marking the plumb cut of a rafter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rafter</b> <b>hips</b> {{are often}} amplified by poor muscling along thighs and lower hips. Exercises to improve muscling helps the problem.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Hip</b> {{and jack}} <b>rafters</b> use twelve {{as a common}} {{reference}} while aligning the desired pitch in the side cut column.|$|R
50|$|Hip/Val {{indicate}} {{the rise in}} inches over a 17 inch run for <b>Hip</b> or Valley <b>rafters</b> from 1 inch to 30 inch.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] The {{side cut}} is the beveled {{angle of the}} <b>hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> that fits into the ridge board in this image.|$|R
50|$|Difference in lengths jacks. The jack rafters lie in {{the same}} plane as the common rafter but connect the top plate (the wall) or ridge board to the <b>hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> respectively. Since the <b>hip</b> or valley <b>rafter</b> meets the ridge board and the common rafter at angles of 45 degrees, the jack rafters will have varying lengths when they {{intersect}} the hip or valley. Depending on the spacing of the rafters, their lengths will vary by a constant factor—this number is the common difference.|$|R
50|$|Light-frame methods allow easy {{construction}} of unique roof designs; hip roofs, for example, slope toward walls {{on all sides}} and are joined at <b>hip</b> <b>rafters</b> that span from corners to a ridge. Valleys are formed when two sloping roof sections drain toward each other. Dormers are small areas in which vertical walls interrupt a roof line, and which are topped off by slopes at usually right angles to a main roof section. Gables are formed when a length-wise section of sloping roof ends to form a triangular wall section. Clerestories are formed by an interruption along the slope of a roof where a short vertical wall connects it to another roof section. Flat roofs, which usually include at least a nominal slope to shed water, are often surrounded by parapet walls with openings (called scuppers) to allow water to drain out. Sloping crickets are built into roofs to direct water away from areas of poor drainage, such as behind a chimney {{at the bottom of}} a sloping section.|$|R
50|$|The Hotel Higgins is a 2-1/2 story wood frame {{building}} with a U-shaped plan. Two major blocks face the street with deep hipped roofs, connected by a hipped block of the same height set back from the street and fronted by a one-story entrance porch. The side elevations feature small shed dormers that are almost {{as wide as the}} <b>hip</b> ridge. <b>Rafter</b> tails are exposed at the eaves. As built it had 38 rooms, with high ceilings and plaster ceiling trim. The original lap siding on the exterior has been covered by asbestos shingle siding.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} names for rafters {{depending}} on their location, shape, or size (see below). The earliest surviving roofs in Europe are of common rafters on a tie beam, this assembly is technically called a [...] "closed couple". Later principal rafters and common rafters were mixed which is called a major/minor or primary/secondary roof system.Historically many <b>rafters,</b> including <b>hip</b> <b>rafters,</b> often taper in height 1/5 to 1/6 of their width, the larger end at the foot. Architect George Woodward discusses {{the purpose of this}} in 1860: “The same amount of strength can be had with a less amount of lumber. There is an additional labor in sawing such rafters, as well as a different calculation to be made in using up a log to the best advantage. It is necessary always to order this special bill of rafters direct from the mill, and the result will be that the extra cost will, nine times out of ten, overbalance the amount saved.”. John Muller also discusses a one-sixth taper for rafters. Pieces added at the feet to create an overhang or change the roof pitch are called a sprocket or coyau in French. (The projecting piece on the gable of a building forming an overhang is called a lookout. A rafter can be reinforced with a strut, principal purlin, collar beam, or rarely an auxiliary rafter (see below).|$|R
40|$|The Housing Standards 1963, now Supplement No. 5 to the National Building Code of Canada, {{require that}} <b>hip</b> and valley <b>rafters</b> be 2 in. deeper that the {{corresponding}} common rafters and that, in addition, ridge support be {{provided in the}} hip or valley section where a tie cannot be made between opposite rafter ends. Calculations were made to check the adequacy of this requirement. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to use the}} square tool, construction calculators are also used to verify and determine roofing calculations. Some are programmed to calculate all side cuts for hip, valley and jack regular rafters to be exactly 45° for all rafter pitches. The rafter table is expressed in inches, and the higher the numerical value of the pitch, the greater the difference between side cut angles within a given pitch. Only a level roof, or a 0 pitch will require a 45° angle side cut (cheek cut) for <b>hip</b> and jack <b>rafters.</b>|$|R
