Focal hepatic accumulation of radioiodine is a rare finding and is usually regarded {{as a sign of}} liver metastasis. Further treatment with operation or radioiodine ablation therapy is usually needed. We report a case of a patient with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy and ablation therapy with high dose radioiodine. A focal, round accumulation of radioiodine in the liver was demonstrated in the whole body 131 <b>I</b> <b>scan.</b> Ultrasonography revealed a large liver cyst, which corresponded to the lesion with increased radioiodine uptake.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Follow-up of 131 <b>I</b> whole-body <b>scanning</b> after 131 <b>I</b> {{ablation}} {{is associated}} with potential stunning. Previous studies have suggested that, for <b>scanning,</b> 123 <b>I</b> is more sensitive than 131 I in identifying thyroid tissue, but its specificity when positive is less certain. AIM: The use of 123 I as an imaging agent in place of serial 131 I imaging has been evaluated in the surveillance and treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. RESULTS: A total of 186 studies in 136 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were evaluated after total or near total thyroidectomy followed by 131 I ablation. In 125 studies 123 <b>I</b> <b>scanning</b> was negative and no 131 I therapy was given; four patients were positive on 123 <b>I</b> <b>scanning</b> but for other reasons no 131 I therapy was given. In 48 / 49 patients a positive 123 <b>I</b> <b>scan</b> was followed by positive 131 I therapeutic uptake. Only one patient failed to show positive uptake of I when first treated and she subsequently demonstrated uptake on a second therapy. CONCLUSION: High-dose 123 I imaging is the correct predictor of the 131 <b>I</b> post-therapy <b>scan</b> findings in most cases, at an administered activity that avoids stunning. As a diagnostic agent it is preferable to 131 I in differentiated thyroid carcinoma...|$|R

A single-scanning technology with a scan conversion method has already been investigated by authors to realize a single display system for all existing kinds of TV image formats with different scanning-lines, indicating-channels and so on. From the researches it has been confirmed that the proposed 1000 -scanning-line double-field wobbling method can obtain a minimum deterioration of the vertical response and no degradation of the motion of an image, and that the aliasing and flickering effects caused {{by the use of}} a conventional interlaced scanning can be eliminated in the system. In this paper it has been mentioned that the same advantages due to a newly developed scan conversion, which employs a double field-rate, double scanning-line and wobbling method similarly, can be well introduced for a large-area display with higher brightness and contrast to attain a higher picture-quality of not only the 480 <b>i</b> <b>scanning</b> image source but also the 480 p and 1080 <b>i</b> <b>scanning</b> image sources whose degradation of the vertical resolution has to be brought on account of the high-density scanning system with a narrow scanning-line interval. 1...|$|R

This descriptive and prospective study was performed over 40 patients with DTC who were referred to Dr. Dabiri Nuclear Medicine Center from 2004 - 2005.
