25|$|The {{complete}} lifecycles {{of any of}} {{the species}} of Pneumocystis are not known, but presumably all resemble the others in the genus. The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than mycological terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as a protozoan parasite. It is an extracellular parasite. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be cultured ex vivo, direct observation of living Pneumocystis is difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe) which, like Pneumocystis, belong to the Taphrinomycotina branch of the fungal kingdom. The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appears amoeboid (multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within these ascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue.

40|$|Taste is a {{property}} that {{is thought to}} potentially modulate swallowing behavior. Whether such effects depend on taste, intensity remains unclear. This study explored differences in the amplitudes of tongue-palate pressures in swallowing {{as a function of}} taste stimulus concentration. Tongue-palate pressures were collected in 80 healthy women, in two age groups (under 40, over 60), stratified by <b>genetic</b> taste <b>status</b> (nontasters, supertasters). Liquids with different taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) were presented in high and low concentrations. General labeled magnitude scale ratings captured perceived taste intensity and liking/disliking of the test liquids. Path analysis explored whether factors of taste, concentration, age group, and/or <b>genetic</b> taste <b>status</b> impacted: (1) perceived intensity; (2) palatability; and (3) swallowing pressures. Higher ratings of perceived intensity were found in supertasters and with higher concentrations, which were more liked/disliked than lower concentrations. Sweet stimuli were more palatable than sour, salty, or bitter stimuli. Higher concentrations elicited stronger tongue-palate pressures independently and in association with intensity ratings. The perceived intensity of a taste stimulus varies as a function of stimulus concentration, taste quality, participant age, and <b>genetic</b> taste <b>status</b> and influences swallowing pressure amplitudes.

40|$|Abstract Background Many cancer {{clinical}} trials now specify the particular <b>status</b> of a <b>genetic</b> lesion in a patient's tumor in the inclusion or exclusion criteria for trial enrollment. To facilitate search and identification of gene-associated {{clinical trials}} by potential participants and clinicians, {{it is important}} to develop automated methods to identify genetic information from narrative trial documents. Methods We developed a two-stage classification method to identify genes and <b>genetic</b> lesion <b>statuses</b> in clinical trial documents extracted from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Physician Data Query (PDQ) cancer clinical trial database. The method consists of two steps: 1) to distinguish gene entities from non-gene entities such as English words; and 2) to determine whether and which <b>genetic</b> lesion <b>status</b> is associated with an identified gene entity. We developed and evaluated the performance of the method using a manually annotated data set containing 1, 143 instances of the eight most frequently mentioned genes in cancer clinical trials. In addition, we applied the classifier to a real-world task of cancer trial annotation and evaluated its performance using a larger sample size (4, 013 instances from 249 distinct human gene symbols detected from 250 trials). Results Our evaluation using a manually annotated data set showed that the two-stage classifier outperformed the single-stage classifier and achieved the best average accuracy of 83. 7 % for the eight most frequently mentioned genes when optimized feature sets were used. It also showed better generalizability when we applied the two-stage classifier trained on one set of genes to another independent gene. When a gene-neutral, two-stage classifier was applied to the real-world task of cancer trial annotation, it achieved a highest accuracy of 89. 8 %, demonstrating the feasibility of developing a gene-neutral classifier for this task. Conclusions We presented a machine learning-based approach to detect gene entities and the <b>genetic</b> lesion <b>statuses</b> from clinical trial documents and demonstrated its use in cancer trial annotation. Such methods would be valuable for building information retrieval tools targeting gene-associated clinical trials. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine effect {{modification}} between {{genetic susceptibility}} to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and dietary antioxidant or fish consumption on AMD risk. Design Pooled data analysis of population-based cohorts. Participants Participants from the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) and Rotterdam Study (RS). Methods Dietary intakes of antioxidants (lutein/zeaxanthin [LZ], ß-carotene, and vitamin C), long-chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and zinc were estimated from food frequency questionnaires. The AMD genetic risk was classified {{according to the}} number of risk alleles of CFH (rs 1061170) or ARMS 2 (rs 10490924) as low (no or 1 risk allele) or high (≥ 2 risk alleles). Interactions between dietary intake and genetic risk levels were assessed. Associations between dietary intake and AMD risk were assessed comparing the highest with the 2 lower intake tertiles by genetic risk subgroups using discrete logistic regression, conducted in each study separately and then using pooled data. Participants without AMD lesions at any visit were controls. We adjusted for age and sex in analyses of each cohort sample and for smoking status and study site in pooled-data analyses. Main Outcome Measures: All 15 -year incident late AMD cases were confirmed by chief investigators of the Beaver Dam Eye Study, BMES, and RS. Intergrader reproducibility was assessed in an early AMD subsample, with 86. 4 % agreement between BMES and RS graders, allowing for a 1 -step difference on a 5 -step AMD severity scale. Results: In pooled data analyses, we found significant interaction between AMD <b>genetic</b> risk <b>status</b> and LZ intake (P = 0. 0009) but nonsignificant interactions between <b>genetic</b> risk <b>status</b> and weekly fish consumption (P = 0. 05) for risk of any AMD.

No similar association was evident among participants with low genetic risk.

40|$|The proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model {{states that}} {{psychotic}} experiences {{are more likely}} to lead to impairment if their expression becomes persistent. Higher genetic risk for psychosis is known to affect proneness and persistence of subclinical positive symptoms. Less is known about potential effects of genetic risk on the course of subclinical negative symptoms, impairment, and their subsequent associations. The current study examined these issues in a large sample (n = 1131), consisting of individuals with higher genetic risk (siblings of patients with psychotic disorders, n = 703) and lower genetic risk (controls without a family member with lifetime psychosis, n = 428). Psychotic experiences were assessed with the CAPE questionnaire, at two time points three years apart. Participants were allocated to one of four groups representing developmental course: stable low, decreasing, increasing or persisting subclinical positive/negative symptoms. Lifetime clinical psychosis was an exclusion criterion at baseline. Higher <b>genetic</b> risk <b>status</b> was found to be associated with a persisting course of both subclinical positive and negative symptoms, symptom-related distress and functional impairment.
