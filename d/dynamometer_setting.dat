40|$|International audienceTen European {{laboratories}} {{worked together}} to study {{the influence of a}} lot of parameters of the measurement of light vehicle emission factors on vehicle bench, in order to improve the accuracy, reliability and representativeness of emission factors: driving patterns (driving cycles, gear choice behaviour, driver and cycle following), vehicle related parameters (technical characteristics of the vehicle, emission stability, emission degradation, fuel properties, vehicle cooling and preconditioning), vehicle sampling (method, sample size), and laboratory related parameters (ambient temperature and humidity, <b>dynamometer</b> <b>setting,</b> dilution ratio, heated line sampling temperature, PM filter preconditioning, response time, dilution air). The results are based on literature synthesis, on about 2700 specific tests with 183 vehicles and on the reprocessing of more than 900 tests. These tests concern the regulated atmospheric pollutants and pre-Euro to Euro 4 vehicles. We did not find any influence of 7 parameters, and find only a qualitative influence for 7 other parameters. 6 parameters have a clear and quantifiable influence and 5 among them allow us to design correction factors to normalise emission measurements: gearshift strategy, vehicle mileage, ambient temperature and humidity, dilution ratio. The sixth influencing parameter is the driving cycle, sometimes more significant than the fuel or the emission standard. The results allow us to design recommendations or guidelines for the emission factor measurement method...|$|E
40|$|Literature remains {{lacking in}} regards to the role that initial {{restrictive}} pressure (IRP) coupled with resistance training as it pertains to the production and accumulation of metabolic byproducts such as lactate, more specifically in women. Purpose: The present study investigates the importance of the IRP as a variable on lactate concentrations during knee extension exercise in combination with blood flow restriction in female subjects. Methods: Thirteen female volunteers (age 21 ± 1. 35) served as the test sample for this study. Initial health screening, PAR-Q, signing of the informed consent, procedural and <b>dynamometer</b> <b>setting</b> familiarization were completed on the first meeting. Prior to exercise, the participants’ maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of right leg extensors was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Participants performed knee extension exercise with IRP set randomly at either 40 - 45 mmHg or 60 - 65 mmHg on two subsequent visits separated by a minimum of 48 hours. On each visit, participants performed 4 sets (1 × 30 reps and 3 × 15 reps) of dynamic knee extension exercises with the load set at 20 % of their respective MVC. The load lifted for both visits was same and determined using pre-MVC values from the first visit. A lactate analyzer was employed to measure lactate concentration within blood sample from finger pricks. Participants washed their hands before testing started and isopropyl alcohol wipes were used to clean the puncture site before the collection of blood. Levels of lactate concentration were measured prior to exercise, between the second and third sets, and at immediately post exercise. Results: A significant main effects for time (p 0. 05) between the conditions (40 - 45 mmHg vs. 60 - 65 mmHg) over the course of dynamic knee extension exercise. Conclusion: Given that females may store more adipose tissue accumulated around their hip and thighs, magnitude of the effect of IRPs may vary within and across genders, resulting in changes in the type of muscle fibers (type I vs. type IIx) recruited, the total number of muscle fibers recruited, and the level of fatigue. More research is required to determine the impact of various IRPs on the level of byproducts production and accumulation...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the methodology and results of {{evaluation of the}} flow capacity of the fuel injectors in the automobiles, equipped with spark ignition, port fuel injection engine. Automobiles, which are designed to work with regular gasoline, can be adapted for use of blend of bioethanol and gasoline, for instance, fuel E 85. Certain components have to be evaluated for their compatibility with E 85. The fuel injectors of the adapted engine have to supply a larger amount of E 85 fuel, comparing with the operation with gasoline. The studies were conducted on two unmodified automobiles. The tests were performed on a roll type chassis <b>dynamometer,</b> <b>set</b> in constant speed mode. The measurements were done using a multichannel oscilloscope and piezoelectric microphone. Combined electrical and acoustic injector diagnostic methods were used and are thoroughly explained. The obtained results confirm the efficiency and robustness of the chosen diagnostic method.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was the further {{development}} and reconstruction of the Motor Generator <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>set</b> up. Once completed, the apparatus {{is to be used}} as a learning tool for the engineering students at Murdoch University, demonstrating key concepts of electric machines and their reactions to the change in load conditions. For the mention primary aim the design, construction and commissioning of a load bank had to be adapted to the initial setup to enable the students to alter the connected load. Measurements and control of the apparatus was achieved through National instruments NI 6014 data acquisition unit and National Instruments LabVIEW. The understanding of the project and the work that had been previously completed was the first stage of the project. Understanding the current system setup including the: • DAQ system • AC motor • DC Generator The resolution of existing problems was attempted such as overcoming the interference induced by the variable Frequency drive, accurate speed measurement of the machines and calibration of the torque measurement. As the main priority associated with the development of this project was safety for undergraduate students to perform experiments without the risk of being injured. This is why a complete reconstruction of the set up must take place further information can be found in the guidelines and design approaches that have been developed...|$|R
40|$|To measure age-related {{skeletal}} muscle changes, 30 healthy, moderately active women performed isometric and dynamic {{strength and endurance}} tests of their left quadriceps femoris muscle groups. Fifteen of the subjects were ages 20 to 29 years and 15 were ages 50 to 80 years. A Cybex ® II isokinetic dynamometer {{was used to measure}} the torque output isometrically with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion on three trials. In addition, each subject performed three trials from 90 degrees of knee flexion to full knee extension and back to 90 degrees of knee flexion with the velocity of the isokinetic <b>dynamometer</b> <b>set</b> at 10 rpms. Endurance time was calculated to be the length of time a torque output of at least 50 percent of the maximal strength could be maintained. The t tests done revealed {{a significant difference between the}} two groups on isometric and dynamic strength, while no significant difference was found on isometric or dynamic endurance. Statistically correcting for the extraneous variables, height and weight, through a partial correlation revealed a significant negative corre-lation between age and strength. The younger subjects had higher torque outputs, both isometrically and dynamically, than the older subjects. The same partial correlation between isometric endurance and age and dynamic endurance and age demonstrated no significant correlation. The fact that endurance did not change in this older population while strength did may be the result of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers changing with age...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aimed to {{standardize}} isotonic (IT) and isokinetic (IK) eccentric exercises by equalizing {{the amount of}} work and the angular velocity at two intensity levels, to be able to compare specific effects of these exercise modes on the neuromuscular system. Fourteen subjects participated in three test sessions consisting of two IT and two IK sets on a customized isokinetic <b>dynamometer.</b> IT <b>sets</b> were comprised of 8 eccentric contractions of the knee extensors at 120 % of the maximal repetition (1 RM) in the first two sessions, and 100 % in the third session. IK sets were performed at the same mean angular IT velocity and stopped when {{the amount of work}} performed corresponded to the IT set. External work, angular velocity and Root Mean Square (RMS) of electromyographic activity of three superficial muscles of the quadriceps femoris were calculated. Results showed concordance of work and angular velocity for each test session. Both modes involved the same number of repetitions at 120 % and fewer repetitions in IK mode at 100 % of 1 RM. Work and RMS values remained steady in all sets. This study allowed the standardization of isotonic and isokinetic eccentric exercises, a first step before determining their specific effects on neuromuscular function...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} concentric quadriceps muscle torque at 30 °, 60 °, and 75 ° of knee extension, 25 female university students were studied. Each subject was tested on the Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer on 2 separate days, 7 days apart. The <b>dynamometer's</b> speed was <b>set</b> at 60 °ls. Intraclass correlation coefficients for 30 °, 60 °, and 75 ° were 0. 84 (p<. 01), 0. 87 (p<. 01), and 0. 83 (p<. 01), respectively. The standard errors of the measure were 5. 92 N·m, 7. 65 N·m, and 7. 35 N·m, respectively. Based on the instrumentation and protocol used in this study, we believe angle-specific torques have good reliability. Because of the error size, clinicians using similar methodology to determine angle-specific torques should be cautious when comparing differences between angle-specific torques of less than 12 to 16 N·m...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundHand {{strength}} deficit following digital replantation {{is usually}} {{attributed to the}} mechanical deficiency of the replanted digit. Zone 1 replantation, however, should not be associated with any mechanical deficit, as the joint and tendon are intact. We evaluate short-term motor functions in patients who have undergone single-digit zone 1 replantation. MethodsA single-institution retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent zone 1 replantation. Hand and pinch strengths were evaluated using standard <b>dynamometers.</b> Each <b>set</b> of measurements was pooled according to follow-up periods (within 1 month, 1 to 2 months, 2 to 3 months, and after 3 months). The uninjured hand was used as reference for measurements. ResultsThe review identified 53 patients who had undergone zone 1 replantation and presented for follow-up visits. Compared to the uninjured hand, dynamometer measurements revealed significantly less strength for the hand with replanted digit at one month. The relative mean grip, pulp, and key pinch strength were 31 %, 46 %, and 48 % of the uninjured hand. These three strength measurements gradually increased, with relative strength measurements of 59 %, 70 %, and 78 % for 4 -month follow up. ConclusionsDespite the lack of joint or tendon injury, strength of the injured hand was significantly {{lower than that of}} the uninjured hand during the 4 months following replantation. Improved rehabilitation strategies are needed to diminish the short-term negative impact that an isolated zone 1 replantation has on the overall hand strength...|$|R
50|$|On 3 July 1938 4468 Mallard; {{the first}} of the class to enter service with the Kylchap exhaust, pulling six coaches and a <b>dynamometer</b> car, <b>set</b> a world speed record (indicated by the dynamometer) of 126 mph. However, Gresley never {{accepted}} this as the record-breaking maximum. He claimed this speed could only have been attained over a few yards, though he was comfortable that the German speed record of 124.5 mph had been surpassed. Close analysis of the dynamometer roll (currently at the NRM) of the record run confirms that Mallards speed did in fact exceed that of the German BR 05 002. The Mallard record reached its maximum speed on a downhill run and actually failed technically in due course, whereas 05 002s journey was on level grade and the engine did not yet seem to be at its limit. On the other hand, the German train was only four coaches long (197 tons), but Mallards train was seven coaches (240 tons).One fact that is often ignored when considering rival claims is that Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a 15 mph permanent way check just North of Grantham. Despite this a record was set. Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. Prior to the record run on 3 July 1938, it was calculated that 130 mi/h km/h was possible, and in fact Driver Duddington and LNER Inspector Sid Jenkins both said they might well have achieved this figure if they not had to slow for the Essendine junctions.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Recovery {{is a key}} aspect {{in sports}} performance. Self myofascial release is a {{technique}} where you massage your muscles with various tools. Previous study have showed that it can improve mobility. There {{is a lack of}} scientific studies made in this area. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of self myofascial release on maximal force in the grip after activity involving the grip until failure. Method: Eleven subjects were tested in grip strength in the right and left arm with a grip <b>dynamometer.</b> After a <b>set</b> of exhaustive activity for the grip the subjects performed self myofascial release on one arm. Grip strength was then re-tested after 5 minutes and 24 hours. Result: There was a significant decrease in strength following the exhaustive exercise. Subjects had regained their full strength after 24 hours of rest. Self myofascial release did not affect the recovery according to the result. Discussion: More research need to be done. If using a similar approach as in this study the recovery time need to be shorter so that subjects do not recover their full strength. There are indications that the dominant arm recover faster than the non-dominant arm...|$|R
40|$|Stiff knee gait (SKG) {{is one of}} a few {{classified}} walking patterns {{which people}} with cerebral palsy (pwCP) can present with. The characteristic for SKG is delayed and/or reduced peak knee flexion during swing phase, which can reduce walking ability and result in functional restrictions. Through the use of both clinical and laboratory based measures this cross-sectional study aimed to identify the factors associated with SKG, suggest possible treatment options and propose potential directions for future research. The impact of five variables on knee flexion amplitude during the swing phase of gait was assessed. Data was gathered from a group of 27 pwCP and 20 age-matched controls. Three dimensional motion analysis was used to record the kinetics and kinematics of the pelvis and lower limbs. Isometric strength of the ankle plantarflexors, knee extensors, hip flexors and hip extensors was recorded via maximal voluntary contraction using a dynamometer. Passive and stretch-mediated stiffness of the knee extensors was also recorded using a <b>dynamometer</b> with two <b>set</b> stretch speeds. The main findings highlight that several factors are correlated with SKG. The key determinants of which are a crouch positioning of the lower limb in stance phase and spasticity within the knee extensors. Additionally, secondary analysis highlighted the importance of the knee extensors inner/outer range strength ratio. Greater weakness in inner range was linked to increased spasticity, to the degree of crouch and in turn to a smaller degree of knee flexion in swing phase. This study further highlighted that both clinical and laboratory based measures may be used to determine the possible causes of SKG but that laboratory based gait analysis and outcome measures were more sensitive and had higher predictive power. The implications for treatment are to be mindful of the fact that by attempting to improve one impairment it does not have a negative effect upon another. Inter-relationships between impairments need to be looked at in more detail. Future work should evaluate treatments on SKG of strengthening the inner range quadriceps with/without a stretching programme...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{cutting process}} {{is defined as}} a process which used to change shape of a metal made product by cutting. One kind of the cutting method which usually used is lathe process, where the process is {{maintained}} toward work substance of cylindrical shape. This observation is aimed to determine the effect or response graphic of independent variable which determined (spindle rotation speed, feed motion, cutting depth and material hardness level) toward dependent variable (cutting force and surface coarseness) of dynamometer designed and built by Machine Technique of UNDIP. The <b>Dynamometer</b> is a <b>set</b> of measurement tool which used to estimate of cutting force by principle to change its tension to be cutting force. The Dynamometer which working is using principle of electric. Commonly, the resistance change which used to measure the tension of motion measurement (LVDT pick-ups, moving plate capacitance pick-ups). To gain the response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable in this observation is using two testing method, both testing with simple method and testing with Taguchi method. The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), feed motion by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). Whereas the best value on surface coarseness is yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth with level 1 (0. 5 mm), feed motion with level 1 (0. 045 mm / rev) and specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). From this observation can be concluded that the dynamometer which made and designed shows the cutting force will be greater if spindle rotation value is smaller, the value of cutting depth more bigger, feed rotation value more bigger and material coarseness level more higher. Meanwhile for the best value on surface coarseness is yielded if the spindle rotation is on low rotation, low feed motion, small cutting depth and iron specimen is DIN 34 CrNiMo 6.

40|$|Ceramic {{composites}} incorporating synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAp) particulate and thermoplastic polymer matrices {{are finding}} wide spread applications in bio-medical field. The fractured or damaged bone can be repaired or replaced by artificial bone materials. HAp {{has been tested}} many times as an artificial bone, especially as augmentation material in surgery work or as a coating material on bio-inert implants materials. It has shown excellent biocompatibility and bonding characteristics. Many implant materials used for last three decades are basically metals, alloys, ceramics and polymers etc. Most metals and ceramics are much stiffer than bone tissue resulting in mechanical mismatch (i. e. “stress shielding”) between the implant and the adjacent bone tissue. Metals are too stiff and pose other biocompatibility problems whereas ceramics are too brittle but polymers are too flexible and weak to meet the mechanical strength. However, polymers are popular due to their low density, good mechanical strength and easy formability. Therefore, polymeric bone implants are widely used. HAp particulates are mixed with polymer matrix {{through a series of}} processing stages involving melt compounding, granulating and micro-injection moulding. HAp is a suitable ceramic material for hard tissue replacement. In the present work, HAp is synthesized by wet chemical precipitation route. The mechanical properties such as tensile, compressive, flexural, impact and hardness are assessed for the composites varying HAp volume percentage in polycarbonate (PC) and polysulfone (PSU) polymers. The wear resistance of composites in abrasion, erosion, sliding and fretting mode is assessed in dry environment. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is proposed for prediction of wear behaviour of composites. The effect of drilling parameters on surface integrity of internal holes made on composite is assessed to provide insight into machinability (i. e. drilling) aspects of composites. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop material that has similar mechanical properties to that of human bone in order to achieve mechanical compatibility in the body, examine the various mechanical properties of ceramic composites, assess the performance of the ceramic composites under different wear modes and evaluate the performance of the composites in drilling operation. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared test (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-body abrasion wear behaviour of the composite is evaluated using pin-on-disc friction and wear test rig (ASTM G 99). The experiment is conducted using three different water proof silicon carbide (SiC) abrasive papers of 400, 600 and 1000 grit size. Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array is used to evaluate the tribological property with four control variables such as HAp volume percentage, load applied, sliding speed and track radius, each at three levels. The highest abrasive wear loss is noticed in the specimens worn with 400 grit size SiC paper. Erosion wear of ceramic composites is performed on air jet erosion test rig (ASTM G 76). In this study, dry silica sand (spherical) of different particle size of 300 μm, 400 μm and 500 μm are used as erodent. Taguchi’s L 27 design is used to evaluate the tribological property with three control variables such as pressure, HAp volume, and impingement angle, each at three levels. The higher erosive wear loss is noticed in the specimens worn with 500 μm erodent particle size as compared to both 300 μm and 400 μm erodent particle size. The sliding wear test of ceramic composites is performed on ball on plate wear tester (ASTM G 194). Taguchi’s L 27 design is designed to evaluate the tribological properties with three control variables such as HAp volume percentage, load applied and sliding speed, each at three levels. The fretting wear test of ceramic composites is performed on high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) testing machine (ASTM D 6079). Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array is used to evaluate the tribological properties with three control variables such as HAp volume, load applied and frequency, each at three levels. Since drilling is used to join the composite material with adjacent bone tissue in orthopaedic surgery, it is important to study drilling performance of the composite. Experiments have been conducted on a CNC milling machine using Taguchi’s L 27 design with four control variables such as HAp volume percentage, drilling speed, feed rate and drill bit diameter, each at three levels. The responses considered are circularity at entry and exit, torque and thrust force. The circularity at both entry and exit is measured using the ratio of minimum diameter (Dmin) to maximum diameter (Dmax) of the drilled hole. The torque and thrust force are measured using drill <b>dynamometer.</b> Best parametric <b>setting</b> for simultaneous optimization of multiple performance measures such as circularity at entry, circularity at exit, torque and thrust in drilling operation is suggested using principal component analysis. ...|$|R
