40|$|In {{the present}} decade along the {{increasing}} trend of using private vehicles, calming the local streets and residential areas has been important for local authorities. There are many unsuccessful experiences of traffic calming implementations because of lacking knowledge and engineered assessment before implementing them. Considering the <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of traffic, calming measure {{is an essential}} factor to employ these measures. <b>Design</b> <b>speed</b> of different size of speed humps is investigated in previous studies because of its circular shape but for speed tables it is unknown. In this research the <b>design</b> <b>speeds</b> of two common speed tables {{in the city of}} Tehran have been examined, 6. 5 and 8. 5 m speed table. For calculating the <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of the speed tables, we asked 220 drivers to participate in our experiment by installing a GPS tracker in their vehicles and encouraging them to drive normally. Crossing speeds over 6. 5 and 8. 5 m speed tables have been analysed by collecting totally 220 samples. We pick out 100 correct samples for each speed table and the 85 th percentile speed has been calculated for them, consequently the results of 85 th percentile calculation of the crossing speeds have been proposed as the <b>design</b> <b>speeds.</b> For 6. 5 m <b>speed</b> table, <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> is calculated 41. 5 km/h and for 8. 5 m <b>speed</b> table, <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> is calculated 47. 5 km/h. the comparison of recent findings and past finding of 9. 5 m speed table which is used in Denmark with a <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of 80 km/h reveals that 1 m increasing with the length of a 6. 5 speed table plateau will result 3 km/h increase in its <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b> The findings of this research can help traffic calming experts to take in consideration of the relation between speed table physical characteristics and its <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore by finding the <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of speed tables, we can choose suitable speed tables for streets with different speed limits according to the <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of speed tables...|$|R

40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Freeway ramp <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> criteria contained in current American Association of Highway and Transportation Official (AASHTO) and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) design policies have been traced through roughly 50 years of technical literature. The evolution of <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> criteria has been documented and technical rational leading to periodic changes has been included. TxDOT ramp <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> criteria are, essentially, the AASHTO criteria. The origins of driver acceleration and deceleration rates, which are built into the AASHTO criteria, are experimental studies performed during the late thirties.

A conceptual data collection plan has been designed to provide information that will answer questions regarding current criteria. Additionally, a nationwide survey of ramp design agencies indicates that (1) there is a variety of different design policies; (2) most designers have concern for entrance ramps, as opposed to exits; and (3) safety is the most commonly used evaluation measure. 17.

40|$|An aeroacoustic {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} assess the effects of adding mass flow at the trailing edges of four stators upstream of an aircraft engine simulator. By using trailing edge blowing to minimize the shed wakes of the stators, the flow into the rotor was made more uniform. In these experiments a reduced number of stators (four) was used in a 1 / 14 scale model inlet which was coupled to a 4. 1 in (10. 4 cm) turbofan engine simulator with 18 rotors and 26 downstream stators. This study is a preliminary step toward a more in depth investigation of using trailing edge blowing to reduce unsteady rotor-stator interaction. Steady-state measurements of the aerodynamic flow field and acoustic far field were made in order to evaluate the aeroacoustic performance at three simulator speeds: 40 %, 60 %, and 88 % of the <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b> The lowest test speed of 40 % <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> showed the most dramatic reduction in radiated noise. Noise reductions as large as 8. 9 dB in the blade passing tone were recorded at 40 % <b>design</b> <b>speed,</b> while a tone reduction of 5. 5 dB was recorded at 60 % <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b> At 88 % <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> a maximum tone reduction of 2. 6 dB was recorded. In addition, trailing edge blowing reduced the overall sound pressure level in every case. For both the 40 % <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> and the 60 % <b>design</b> <b>speed,</b> the fan face distortion was significantly reduced due to the trailing edge blowing. The addition of trailing edge blowing from the four upstream stators did not change the total pressure ratio, and the mass flow added by the blowing was approximately 1 %. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that blowing from the trailing edges of the stators is effective in reducing unsteady rotor-stator interaction and the subsequent forward radiated noise. ii...|$|R
