Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>we</b> take care of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
500|$|Future {{directions}} for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing {{the cognitive and}} linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies {{has the potential to}} radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; [...] however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. Natural language generation techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: [...] "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>we</b> can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".|$|E

40|$|Visual {{perception}} {{is often seen}} as an inference problem where uncertainty comes from ambiguities in the world (eg, the two 3 D interpretations of the Necker cube), noise in the world (eg, identifying a scene behind falling snowflakes), or noise in the visual system (eg, synaptic noise). Uncertainty not only influences our performance in visual perception tasks (eg, <b>how</b> <b>well</b> can <b>we</b> discriminate between two orientations) but also our confidence {{in being able to}} perform these tasks (<b>how</b> <b>well</b> can <b>we</b> predict our performance). We present here the results of three psychophysical experiments that illustrate how uncertainty weakens our perception and how it can determine our confidence in our perceptual decisions. In the first experiment on stereopsis, we show that the same level of uncertainty can lead to very different levels of performance depending on the context. In the next two experiments on orientation discrimination, we show that objective confidence judgments are correlated with discrimination performance and that these confidence judgments are not just based on some visibility cues in the stimulus. Overall, these results open the door for a thorough investigation of the processing of uncertainty by the visual system...|$|R
