40|$|Fly-by-wire {{control systems}} in {{advanced}} cockpits {{provide an opportunity}} to simplify the manual control demands on the pilot. However, this simplification may be at the expense of distancing the pilot from direct contact with important sources of information. Control loading systems provide the opportunity for enhancing the capacity of the stick as an information channel, providing the pilot with information about the critical aircraft state variables required for control. In this study parameters governing the movement of the pilot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> (i. e. the stiffness of a spring-centered stick) were dynamically adjusted to be proportional to moment-to-moment states of the simulated vehicle (i. e. roll velocity). The hypothesis was that the “feel” of the dynamically varying <b>stick</b> would provide <b>control</b> information leading to more precise control performance in a single-axis roll tracking task. RMS error results did not support this hypothesis. The result is discussed {{in the context of an}} ongoing research program to examine strategies for information integration in advanced cockpits...|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} for an active hand controller, for example, uses a <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> {{connected}} to {{and controlled by}} a motor. Electronics are provided to control the motor to eliminate oscillations due to motor torque and high gain due to breakout at the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is at about its null position. Both hardware as well as software implementations can provide position dependent dampening to the <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> such that when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is located about a null position, {{a higher rate of}} dampening is provided than when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is located outside the null position, when a lower rate of dampening is provided.

Modifications to each aircraft include {{removal of the}} aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains smoke-oil used in demonstrations, and outfitting with the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> spring system for more precise aircraft control input. The standard demonstration configuration has a spring tensioned with 40 lb of force installed on the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement.

25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: <b>control</b> <b>stick,</b> rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|R
50|$|The yoke or {{joystick}} controls {{rotation of}} the plane about the pitch and roll axes. A yoke resembles a steering wheel, and a <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is a joystick.

Three different levels of <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> force/displacement characteristics and stick electrical gain were varied to observe their influence on RMS (Root Mean Square) tracking error and RMS <b>control</b> activity (<b>stick</b> output).

50|$|Quick-draw boost. (hazushi) The most {{critical}} attack {{to learn in}} the game. This attack is a game-changer tactic used by kakutoh units, the most difficult tactic to execute, similar to the quick-draw. This tactic involves {{the addition of the}} mobile suit's thrusters (the jump foot pedal and the dash pedal), lifting the mobile suit up and away during the quick-draw, allowing the shot to miss, yet still keeping the target lock on the enemy mobile suit, allowing the enemy mobile suit to remain standing, allowing the attacking unit another quick-draw sequence. S-level pilots (very skilled and experienced players) can chain this quick-draw tactic, striking eight times or more, inflicting tremendous damage to an enemy unit before it can retaliate. Gaijin pilots, if you can master the quick-draw boost, you will gain high respect from Japanese pilots and team members. This chain attack is immediately cancelled if you get hit by enemy fire or tackle. Update 170418, version 4.0, kakutou units should equip a no-down main firing weapon (a gun that will not drop a target if fired), and also adjust speed for maximum jump or dash. hazushi action would be left <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> forward, right <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> backward, left pedal down (jump)-all at one time, before the third beam saber strike- to execute a fast jump and twist to the right, disabling target-lock, and shooting away from the target. Quickly swap <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> (left <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> backward, right <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> forward) to twist left and regain target lock. Double click beam saber attack timing is critical since your mobile suit is at point blank, in order to chain-execute another san-ren, quick-draw, or hazushi.|$|R
