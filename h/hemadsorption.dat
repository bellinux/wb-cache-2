50|$|Viral {{replication}} is initiated {{only after}} successful entry into a cell by attachment and fusion between the virus {{and the host}} cell lipid membrane. Viral RNA (vRNA) is initially associated with nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L). The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) is involved with viral attachment and thus <b>hemadsorption</b> and hemagglutination. Furthermore, the fusion (F) protein is important in aiding the fusion of the host and viral cellular membranes, eventually forming syncytia.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections is {{complicated}} by the delayed onset of symptoms and the similarity of symptoms to other pulmonary conditions. Often, M. pneumoniae infections are diagnosed as other conditions and, occasionally, non-pathogenic mycoplasmas present in the respiratory tract are mistaken for M. pneumoniae. Historically, diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections was made based on the presence of cold agglutinins and the ability of the infected material to reduce tetrazolium. Causative diagnosis is dependent upon laboratory testing, however these methods are more practical in epidemiological studies than in patient diagnosis. Culture tests are rarely used as diagnosic tools; rather immunoblotting, immunofluorescent staining, <b>hemadsorption</b> tests, tetrazolium reduction, metabolic inhibition tests, serological assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used for diagnosis and characterization of bacterial pneumonic infections. PCR is the most rapid and effective way to determine the presence of M. pneumoniae, however the procedure does not indicate the activity or viability of the cells present. EIA serological assays are the most common method of M. pneumoniae detection used in patient diagnosis due to the low cost and relatively short testing time. One drawback of serology is that viable organisms are required, which may overstate the severity of infection. Neither of these methods, along with others, has been available to medical professionals in a rapid, efficient and inexpensive enough form to be used in routine diagnosis, leading to decreased ability of physicians to diagnose M. pneumoniae infections.|$|E
40|$|Human {{influenza}} viruses {{derive their}} genes from avian viruses. The neuraminidase (NA) of the avian viruses has, {{in addition to}} the catalytic site, a separate sialic acid binding site (<b>hemadsorption</b> site) that is not present in human viruses. The biological significance of the NA <b>hemadsorption</b> activity in avian influenza viruses remained elusive. A sequence database analysis revealed that the NAs of the majority of human H 2 N 2 viruses isolated during the influenza pandemic of 1957 differ from their putative avian precursor by amino acid substitutions in the <b>hemadsorption</b> site. We found that the NA of a representative pandemic virus A/Singapore/ 1 / 57 (H 2 N 2) lacks <b>hemadsorption</b> activity and that a single reversion to the avian-virus-like sequence (N 367 S) restores <b>hemadsorption.</b> Using this hemadsorption-positive NA, we generated three NA variants with substitutions S 370 L, N 400 S and W 403 R that have been found in the <b>hemadsorption</b> site of human H 2 N 2 viruses. Each substitution abolished <b>hemadsorption</b> activity. Although, there was no correlation between <b>hemadsorption</b> activity of the NA variants and their enzymatic activity with respect to monovalent substrates, all four hemadsorption-negative NAs desialylated macromolecular substrates significantly slower than did the hemadsorption-positive counterpart. The NA of the 1918 pandemic virus A/Brevig Mission/ 1 / 18 (H 1 N 1) also differed from avian N 1 NAs by reduced <b>hemadsorption</b> activity and less efficient hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates. Our data indicate that the <b>hemadsorption</b> site serves to enhance the catalytic efficiency of NA and they suggest that, in addition to changes in the receptor-binding specificity of the hemagglutinin, alterations of the NA are needed for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen {{hemagglutinin}} (HA) of fowl plague virus (FPV) {{was expressed}} in CV- 1 cells by a simian virus 40 vector, <b>hemadsorption</b> was barely detectable, although HA was exposed at the cell surface. However, treatment of HA-expressing cells with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCNA) resulted in extensive <b>hemadsorption.</b> VCNA treatment enhanced the electrophoretic mobility of the HA 1 subunit of HA, indicating {{the removal of}} sialic acid. When two oligosaccharides {{in the vicinity of}} the receptor binding site of FPV HA were deleted by site-specific mutagenesis, VCNA treatment was not required for <b>hemadsorption.</b> Mutants which retained one of these oligosaccharides and mutants in which oligosaccharides not adjacent to the receptor binding site were deleted needed VCNA treatment to show <b>hemadsorption.</b> VCNA treatment also enhanced <b>hemadsorption</b> of vector-expressed HA of the WSN strain, which had a complex-type oligosaccharide {{in the vicinity of the}} receptor binding site, but had no effect on <b>hemadsorption</b> of Hong Kong type HA, which has a high-mannose type oligosaccharide adjacent to the receptor binding site. These results indicate that sialic acid on oligosaccharides near the receptor binding site interferes with <b>hemadsorption.</b> Thus, the neuraminidase is essential for FPV HA to show hemagglutinating activity...|$|E

The relationship between virus concentration and cells exhibiting <b>hemadsorption</b> was linear. The assay was highly precise, sensitive, and reproducible...|$|E
40|$|The N 1 and N 9 {{neuraminidase}} (NA) subtypes {{of influenza}} A viruses exhibit significant <b>hemadsorption</b> activity that localizes {{to a site}} distinct {{from that of the}} enzymatic active site. To determine the conservation of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity among different NAs, we have examined most of the NA subtypes from avian, swine, equine, and human virus isolates. All subtypes of avian virus NAs examined and one equine virus N 8 NA possessed high levels of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity. A swine virus N 1 NA exhibited only weak <b>hemadsorption</b> activity, while in human virus N 1 and N 2 NAs, the activity was detected at a much lower level than in avian virus NAs. NAs which possessed <b>hemadsorption</b> activity for chicken erythrocytes (RBCs) were similarly able to adsorb human RBCs. However, none of the hemadsorption-positive NAs could bind equine, swine, or bovine RBCs, suggesting that RBCs from these species lack molecules, recognized by the NA <b>hemadsorption</b> site, present on human and chicken RBCs. Mutagenesis of the putative <b>hemadsorption</b> site of A/duck/Hong Kong/ 7 / 75 N 2 NA abolished the high level of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity exhibited by the wild-type protein but also resulted in a 50 % reduction of the NA enzymatic activity. A transfectant virus, generated by reverse genetics, containing this mutated NA replicated 10 -fold less efficiently in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures than did a transfectant virus expressing the wild-type NA. However, both viruses replicated equally well in Peking ducks. Although conservation of NA <b>hemadsorption</b> activity among avian virus NAs suggests the maintenance of a required function of NA, loss of the activity does not preclude the replication of the virus in an avian host...|$|E
40|$|Differential {{effect of}} various {{metabolic}} inhibitors {{on the development}} of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity and virus formation in cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was investigated. It was found that, in BHK- 21 cells infected with NDV, cycloheximide did not prevent the development of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity, whereas protein synthesis and virus formation by the cell were rapidly inhibited by the drug. When the drug was added to the culture at 4. 5 h after infection or later, <b>hemadsorption</b> activity of the cell continued to develop normally for about 1 h. Similar increase in <b>hemadsorption</b> activity was found in cells which were treated with anti-NDV serum (to neutralize their <b>hemadsorption</b> activity) and then washed and incubated with cycloheximide. However, when cells were treated with the drug early in the infection (1. 5 or 3. 0 h), they did not show any detectable <b>hemadsorption</b> reaction throughout the infection. In contrast to cycloheximide, iodoacetate added to the culture together with sodium azide inhibited completely both the development of <b>hemadsorption</b> activity and the formation of progeny virus. These results suggest that the change of cell surface to become hemadsorptive may depend upon the energy generating system but not upon de novo synthesis of protein, whereas production of infectious virus may require continuous synthesis of protein...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{adherent}} mycoplasmas have developed highly complex polar structures {{that are involved}} in diverse aspects of the biology of these microorganisms and play a key role as virulence factors by promoting adhesion to host cells in the first stages of infection. Attachment activity of mycoplasma cells has been traditionally investigated by determining their <b>hemadsorption</b> ability to red blood cells and it is a distinctive trait widely examined when characterizing the different mycoplasma species. Despite the fact that protocols to qualitatively determine the <b>hemadsorption</b> or hemagglutination of mycoplasmas are straightforward, current methods when investigating <b>hemadsorption</b> at the quantitative level are expensive and poorly reproducible. By using flow cytometry, we have developed a procedure to quantify rapidly and accurately the <b>hemadsorption</b> activity of mycoplasmas in the presence of SYBR Green I, a vital fluorochrome that stains nucleic acids, allowing to resolve erythrocyte and mycoplasma cells by their different size and fluorescence. This method is very reproducible and permits the kinetic analysis of the obtained data and a precise <b>hemadsorption</b> quantification based on standard binding parameters such as the dissociation constant K d. The procedure we developed could be easily implemented in a standardized assay to test the <b>hemadsorption</b> activity of the growing number of clinical isolates and mutant strains of different mycoplasma species, providing valuable data about the virulence of these microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|We used <b>hemadsorption</b> immunosorbent {{technique}} (HIT) {{to detect}} mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody. IgM from human sera was adsorbed into anti-human IgM-coated wells in plates, and mumps-specific IgM {{was detected by}} adding mumps virus hemagglutinin and guinea pig erythrocytes consecutively. Specific IgM-positive sera showed <b>hemadsorption,</b> whereas negative sera showed hemagglutination. All 81 patients with current mumps infections tested showed mumps-specific IgM antibody, with titers ranging from 160 to 327, 680. In most cases IgM antibody was already present on day 1 or 2 after the onset of illness. IgM antibody persisted for 6 to 10 weeks. Of 57 patients with acute respiratory illnesses caused by parainfluenza virus, 5 showed cross-reactions in the <b>hemadsorption</b> immunosorbent technique assay for mumps IgM. The <b>hemadsorption</b> immunosorbent technique assay is specific for the IgM class of antibody and avoids false-positive results due to rheumatoid factor.

40|$|The direct immunofluorescent {{antibody}} {{method was}} used for the rapid diagnosis of parainfluenza 1 virus. 60 nasopharyngeal secretion specimens known to contain a respiratory virus, as determined by previous conventional isolation procedures, were inoculated onto HeLa cell monolayers on Leighton tube coverslips and onto Rhesus monkey kidney monolayers. 24 hours later, the former were checked for fluorescence and <b>hemadsorption,</b> the latter only for <b>hemadsorption.</b> Of the inoculated specimens, 35 contained parainfluenza 1 virus. In the Rhesus monkey kidney cells <b>hemadsorption</b> was detected in 60 %; in the HeLa cells, <b>hemadsorption</b> and fluorescence were obtained in 31 %. Using a high multiplicity of infection, parainfluenza 1 antigen was detected 10 hours after inoculation of the HeLa cells. These results suggest that immunofluorescence is promising in the rapid diagnosis of parainfluenza 1 virus. Further fluorescent studies should include direct smears of nasopharyngeal secretions and the use of Rhesus monkey kidney instead of HeLa cells...|$|E
40|$|Cytokine {{adsorber}} (CytoSorb) {{has been}} used successfully as adjunctive treatment for adult patients with elevated cytokine levels in the setting with severe sepsis and septic shock and to reduce blood myoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin. In this article we present {{the case of a}} nine-month-old male infant who was admitted to the NICU due to sepsis after cardiac surgery, Fallot tetralogy, and multisystem organ failure (MSOF) including liver failure and renal failure which was successfully treated by a combination of continuous hemodiafiltration (HDF) and <b>hemadsorption</b> with CytoSorb. HDF was safe and effective from the first day for urea removal, but the patient’s bilirubin levels kept increasing gradually, culminating on the 9 th day with a maximum value of 54 [*]mg/dL of total bilirubin and 31. 67 [*]mg/dL of direct bilirubin when we performed <b>hemadsorption</b> with CytoSorb. Over the 49 -hour period of <b>hemadsorption,</b> the total bilirubin value decreased from 54 to 14 [*]mg/dL, and the patient’s general status improved considerably accompanied by a rapid drop of aminotransferases.

40|$|The {{response}} of Newcastle disease virus replication to primaquine, an antimalarial drug, was examined in chicken embryo cells (CEC). Virus-induced <b>hemadsorption</b> was completely inhibited by 250 μg of primaquine per ml. At lower concentrations, <b>hemadsorption</b> inhibition was dose dependent. Primaquine retarded virus-induced redistribution of receptor {{sites on the}} host cell plasma membrane {{as shown by the}} failure of infected, drug-treated CEC to be agglutinated with concanavalin A. The production of infectious progeny virus was substantially inhibited by the addition of primaquine at various times postinfection. When the drug was added early in the virus replication cycle, viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis was inhibited; however, when the drug was added late in the cycle, stimulation of RNA synthesis was observed. Primaquine was also shown to retard the incorporation of [14 C]amino acids into proteins of virus-infected CEC. We suggest that the major role of primaquine is inhibition of protein synthesis; this results in changes in: <b>hemadsorption,</b> redistribution of lectin receptors, release of progeny, and virus-induced RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the vaccinia virus hemagglutinin and <b>hemadsorption</b> was examined. Hemagglutinin synthesis was temporally related to {{the appearance of the}} <b>hemadsorption</b> reaction. Only chicken erythrocytes, which reacted with hemagglutinin, hemadsorbed to infected cells, and both of these reactions were inhibited by Ca 2 +. The distribution of the vaccinia hemagglutinin and 5 ′-adenosine monophosphatase, a plasma membrane marker enzyme, in sucrose gradients was similar. Plasma membrane ghosts derived from infected cells hemadsorbed erythrocytes and yielded hemagglutinin upon sonic disruption.

40|$|Four {{methods for}} the assay of human {{interferon}} in Vero cells were compared {{based on the}} inhibition of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) in tubes, the inhibition of CPE in microplates, the reduction of plaques, and the inhibition of quantitative <b>hemadsorption.</b> For inhibition of CPE, Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus type 2, and vaccinia virus were used for challenge. In the plaque reduction method, Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and poliovirus were employed, and Newcastle disease virus {{was used in the}} quantitative <b>hemadsorption</b> assay. Sindbis virus was most susceptible to interferon in those tests measuring inhibition of CPE, but vesicular stomatitis virus was as sensitive in the plaque reduction method. Highest titers of interferon were recorded in microplates, especially with Sindbis virus as the challenge agent, followed by the quantitative inhibition assay. The CPE inhibition method was the simplest, and the quantitative <b>hemadsorption</b> assay was the most rapid to perform.

The former downregulate CD 46, the putative cellular receptor of MV, are positive for <b>hemadsorption,</b> and are fusogenic in HeLa cells, whereas the latter are negative for these phenotypic markers. CD 46 downregulation in particular, could have profound consequences for the immunopathology of MV infection, as this molecule protects the cell from complement lysis. Mutagenesis of two amino acids, valine and tyrosine at positions 451 and 481, respectively, in the H protein from the vaccine-like Hallé MV strain to their counterparts, glutamate and asparagine, in the H protein from the wild-type Ma 93 F MV strain (creating the V 451 E/Y 481 N double mutation) abrogated CD 46 downregulation, HeLa cell fusion, and <b>hemadsorption.</b> The converse double mutagenesis of the Ma 93 F H protein (E 451 V/N 481 Y) transferred the CD 46 -downregulating, fusogenic, and <b>hemadsorption</b> functions to this protein.

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} that allow demonstration of individual colonies carrying colonization factor antigen (CFA) I or CFA/II or E 8775 -type antigen in mixed bacterial cultures on solid media. These methods {{are based on}} mannose-resistant <b>hemadsorption</b> or CFA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on nitrocellulose replicas of the cultures allowing simultaneous analysis of up to 200 colonies per plate. The sensitivity and specificity of the CFA ELISA nitrocellulose replica method were 97 and 99 %, respectively, for CFA/I-carrying colonies and 99 and 100 % for CFA/II-positive colonies; corresponding figures for the quicker and simpler <b>hemadsorption</b> modification were somewhat lower. Both methods seem to be useful for studying excretion of CFA-carrying bacteria in feces, as indicated by studies in rabbits infected with enterotoxin-producing Escherichia coli in a nonligated-intestine model. By initially absorbing CFA-carrying bacteria on erythrocytes and then performing nitrocellulose replicas of agar colonies of the nonabsorbed bacteria, CFA-deficient mutants could be identified by the <b>hemadsorption</b> method, {{as well as by}} the CFA ELISA. Treatment of CFA-carrying bacteria with antiserum against CFA and complement also resulted in enrichment of spontaneous CFA-deficient mutants that could be identified by the replica methods.
