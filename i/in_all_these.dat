5|$|Osmium {{is found}} in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; {{especially}} the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). In nickel and copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs2); <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> compounds platinum is exchanged by {{a small amount of}} iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides {{with various}} metals.

The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E

Accounts vary of Rupert's role <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> committees of government. Samuel Pepys, no friend of Rupert's, sat on the Tangier Committee with him and later declared that all Rupert did was to laugh and swear occasionally: other records, such as those of the Foreign Affairs Committee, show him taking a full and active role in proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Sharabha as an {{incarnation}} of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one’s religious beliefs. But one common refrain <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> depictions is that Sharabha {{is a combination}} of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as Narasimha (man-lion) or Varaha (the boar).|$|E
5|$|After {{the admiral}} departed, {{the men were}} ordered to {{separate}} themselves into two groups, one for those willing to obey all orders and one for those not willing. To a man, Division Eight chose to obey all orders. Divisions Two and Four were split by the decisions of their men: Small and 43 others chose to form a group unwilling to obey every order. These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group {{failed to show up}} for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners <b>in</b> <b>all.</b> <b>These</b> 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.|$|E

The Tibet Mirror was the first Tibetan-language newspaper published in Kalimpong in 1925. while Himalayan Times was the first English to have come out from Kalimpong in the year 1947, it was closed down in the year 1962 after the Chinese aggression but was started once again and is now in regular print. It is known for its bold and aggressive stand on all local issues.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the war, Connecticut was {{assigned}} to the Cruiser and Transport Force for transport duty, and from 6 January – 22 June 1919 she made four voyages to return troops from France. On 6 January, she left Hampton Roads for Brest, France, where she embarked 1,000 troops. After bringing them to New York (arriving on 2 February), Connecticut traveled back to Brest and picked up the 53rd Pioneer Regiment, a company of Marines, and a company of military police, 1,240 troops <b>in</b> <b>all.</b> <b>These</b> men were delivered to Hampton Roads on 24 March. After two months, Connecticut made another run overseas: following a short period of liberty in Paris for her crew, she embarked 891 men variously from the 502nd Army Engineers, a medical detachment, and the Red Cross. They were dropped off in Newport News on 22 June. On 23 June 1919, after having returned over 4,800 men, Connecticut was reassigned as flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Hilary P. Jones.|$|E
5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> localities, {{it is part of}} a diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). Seorsumuscardinus occurred at the same time as the oldest known Muscardinus.|$|E

5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|No multituberculates {{are known}} to have had hypsodont teeth, none has more than two molariform (molar-like) teeth in a single toothrow, and most have large, blade-like teeth. However, the form of the remains of TNM02067's third cheektooth {{suggests}} it was not such a blade-like tooth and that at least the last three cheekteeth were likely molariform. In these respects, TNM02067 does resemble gondwanatheres in the family Sudamericidae, and Krause and colleagues tentatively identified it as representing that family, primarily {{on the basis of its}} hypsodont teeth. Krause and colleagues compared the dentary in detail to that of Sudamerica, the only other gondwanathere for which a substantial fragment of the jaw was known. Sudamerica has only four, not five, cheekteeth (all of which are molariform), a higher, narrower incisor with a root that extends further through the dentary, and a shorter diastema; <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> respects, TNM02067 is more primitive. In addition, the mental foramen of the TNM02067 is located lower and the cheekteeth vary more in size.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E

5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience.

Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
