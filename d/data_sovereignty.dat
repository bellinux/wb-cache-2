50|$|Data {{localization}} builds {{upon the}} concept of <b>data</b> <b>sovereignty</b> that regulates certain data types by the laws applicable to the data subject or processor. While, <b>data</b> <b>sovereignty</b> may require records about a nations citizens or residents follow its personal or financial data processing laws, data localization goes a step further in requiring that initial collection, processing, and storage occur first within the national boundaries. In some cases, data about a nation's citizens or residents must also be deleted from foreign systems before being removed from systems in the data subject's nation.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} track and trace {{individual}} items, especially through large-scale and distributed networks, {{is the key to}} realizing many important business applications such as supply chain management, asset tracking, and counterfeit detection. Unfortunately, enabling traceability across independent organizations still poses significant challenges in dealing with large volume of <b>data</b> and <b>sovereignty</b> of the participants. This paper describes PeerTrack, a scalable platform for efficiently and effectively tracking and tracing objects in large-scale traceability networks. With a novel data model, a DHTbased indexer, and a distributed query processor, PeerTrack provides an environment where traceability applications can share data across independent organizations in a peer-to-peer fashion. This paper presents the motivation, system design, implementation, and a proof-of-concept system of the PeerTrack platform. 1...|$|R
30|$|Some codes, we call {{emergent}} codes, {{did not fit}} {{under any}} pre-existing theme but still concerned the idea of service value overall (e.g., the use of “service level agreements” in managing services). Over time, the emergent codes were grouped under a consistent theme concerning how a service is managed by the business. We coined the theme “cloud-service governance” to cover this new theme. This new theme encompassed conversations around <b>data</b> security, migration, <b>sovereignty</b> and service level agreements. No other emergent themes concerning service value were found.|$|R
40|$|With recent {{advances}} in technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) and new standards such as the electronic product code (EPC), large-scale traceability is emerging as a key differentiator {{in a wide range}} of enterprise applications (e. g., counterfeit prevention, product recalls, and pilferage reduction). Such traceability applications often need to access data collected by individual enterprises in a distributed environment. Traditional centralized approaches (e. g., data ware-housing) are not feasible for these applications due to their unique characteristics such as large volume of <b>data</b> and <b>sovereignty</b> of the participants. In this paper, we describe an approach that enables applications to share traceability data across independent enterprises in a pure Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) fashion. Data are stored in local repositories of participants and indexed in the network based on structured P 2 P overlays. In particular, we present a generic approach for efficiently indexing and locating individual objects in large, distributed traceable networks, most notably, in the emerging environment of the Internet of Things. The results from extensive experiments show that our approach scales well in both data volume and network size. Yanbo Wu, Quan Z. Sheng and Damith Ranasingh...|$|R

50|$|Technological {{sovereignty}} {{is a political}} outlook that information and communications infrastructure and technology {{is subject to the}} laws of the country in which it is located; <b>data</b> <b>sovereignty</b> or information sovereignty sometimes overlaps with technological sovereignty, since their distinctions are not so clear cut, and also refers to subjection of information to the laws of the country in which the data subject is a citizen, or the information is stored or flows through, whatever its form, including when it has been converted and stored in binary digital form.|$|E

The paper provides insights into a previously unexamined side of the construction of race related issues, and illustrates how oppressive 'race talk' can be challenged. No Full Tex...|$|R

However, implementation of reference laboratory systems is much more complex than simply adopting new technology, especially in international settings. We describe three major areas to be considered by international organizations for successful implementation of electronic reporting systems from public health reference laboratories: benefits of electronic reporting, planning for system implementation (e. g., support, resources, <b>data</b> analysis, country <b>sovereignty),</b> and components of system initiation (e. g., authority, disease definition, feedback, site selection, assessing readiness, problem resolution). Our experience with implementation of electronic public health laboratory data management and reporting systems in the United States and working with international organizations to initiate similar efforts demonstrates that successful reference laboratory reporting can be implemented if surveillance issues and components are planned...|$|R
40|$|This paper problematizes meanings, {{governance}} implications, and metro-political shortcomings {{given the}} evolution of some smart city transitional cases in Europe. As such, current smart city projects in Europe are depicting rather complex urbanity regarding the techno-politics of data, pervasive multi-stakeholder regional configurations, and unlike one-size-fits-all extensions/replications from the metropolitan to the city-regional scale. Ongoing reforms of administrative borders and competences of local governments are increasingly leading to a trend that this paper summarizes as ‘smart devolution’. This paper will thus suggest a conceptual framework encompassing six dimensions to politicize smartness in cities and regions by blending governance with technological and territorial issues {{that sooner or later}} will require context-based and ad-hoc smart city-regional strategies stemming from technological <b>sovereignty,</b> <b>data</b> ownership, and city-regional self-government policies.

Existing cloud solutions can be considered synonymous with unknown locations and potentially hostile environments. Therefore security protection objectives can not be guaranteed in the cloud. Motivated by cloudâĂŹs potential we proposed {{a way to get}} rid of this drawback. We presented π-Cloud, a personal secure cloud, that enables users to benefit from cloud computing and retain <b>data</b> <b>sovereignty</b> by federating the users own resources. More precisely we presented the prototypic implementation of a Resource Manager for personal secure clouds. This includes the coordination of devices which form this cloud as well as the description of the services they provide and the description of external services. For this description an intermediary format, the Cloud Resource Description Language (CRDL) was developed as an extension of the Open Cloud Computing Infrastructure (OCCI). Since OCCI is currently limited to infrastructure services the approach has been extended to support PaaS and SaaS services as well. Furthermore, an architecture for the coordination and management of CRDL service descriptions and the respective services was developed. As a foundation for the π-Box the Resource Manager enables users to (re)gain their <b>data</b> <b>sovereignty</b> when going to the cloud. Scalability and usability of our prototype have been empirically demonstrated by extensive lab tests.|$|E
