40|$|One of {{the criticisms}} of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> {{accounting}} in the literature {{is that it has}} no impact on the financial statement numbers. <b>Human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting numbers, it was felt, would be insignificant. ^ Empirical studies by Elias, Hendricks, Schwan, and others emphasized the impacts <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting had on decision making. This behavioral research contended that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting does have an impact on decision making. ^ This study utilizes a sensitivity analysis on the <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> variables. This was done to determine the magnitude necessary for <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> adjusted net income to deviate significantly from conventional net income. Through this procedure, the human asset balance was also investigated to determine if the ultimate balance would differ from the presently assumed balance of zero. In so doing, if the amount of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> variables necessary for significance is adequately small (in comparison to net income), the general conclusion that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting impacts the income statement and balance sheet can be made. ^ The results were encouraging. With the exception of the short-term scenario with changing variables and net income, the magnitude of the <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> variables were small enough (generally less than ten percent of net income) for <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting to be considered significant at least at the five percent level of confidence. It can be assumed, therefore, that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting does impact the financial statements, giving credence to the previous behavioral studies and the need for <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> accounting to be incorporated into the financial statements. ...|$|R
