5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, <b>fumarase,</b> β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fumarase</b> {{deficiency}} {{is characterized}} by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities. In the newborn period, findings include severe neurologic abnormalities, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and hypotonia. <b>Fumarase</b> deficiency is suspected in infants with multiple severe neurologic abnormalities {{in the absence of}} an acute metabolic crisis. Inactivity of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of <b>fumarase</b> are potential causes. Isolated, increased concentration of fumaric acid on urine organic acid analysis is highly suggestive of <b>fumarase</b> deficiency. Molecular genetic testing for <b>fumarase</b> deficiency is currently available.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two classes}} of fumarases. Classifications depend on the {{arrangement}} of their relative subunit, their metal requirement, and their thermal stability. These include class I and class II. Class I fumarases are able to change state or become inactive when subjected to heat or radiation, are sensitive to superoxide anion, are Iron II (Fe2+) dependent, and are dimeric proteins consisting of around 120 kD. Class II fumarases, found in prokaryotes {{as well as in}} eukaryotes, are tetrameric enzymes of 200,000 D that contain three distinct segments of significantly homologous amino acids. They are also iron-independent and thermal-stable. Prokaryotes are known to have three different forms of fumarase: <b>Fumarase</b> A, <b>Fumarase</b> B, and <b>Fumarase</b> C. <b>Fumarase</b> C {{is a part of the}} class II fumarases, whereas <b>Fumarase</b> A and <b>Fumarase</b> B from Escherichia coli (E. coli) are classified as class I.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fumarase</b> is {{prevalent}} in both fetal and adult tissues. A {{large percentage of}} the enzyme is expressed in the skin, parathyroid, lymph, and colon. Mutations in the production and development of <b>fumarase</b> have led to the discovery of several fumarase-related diseases in humans. These include benign mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and <b>fumarase</b> deficiency. Germinal mutations in <b>fumarase</b> are associated with two distinct conditions. If the enzyme has missense mutation and in-frame deletions from the 3’ end, <b>fumarase</b> deficiency results. If it contains heterozygous 5’ missense mutation and deletions (ranging from one base pair to the whole gene), then leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma/Reed’s syndrome (multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis) could result.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fumarase</b> {{deficiency}} causes encephalopathy, {{severe mental}} retardation, unusual facial features, brain malformation, and epileptic seizures {{due to an}} abnormally low amount of <b>fumarase</b> in cells. It can initially present with polyhydramnios on prenatal ultrasound. Affected neonates may demonstrate nonspecific signs of poor feeding and hypotonia. Laboratory findings in neonates may indicate polycythemia, leukopenia, or neutropenia. As they age, neurological deficits begin to manifest with seizures, dystonias, and severe developmental delay.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fumarase</b> {{deficiency}} {{is caused}} by a mutation in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene in humans, which encodes the enzyme that converts fumarate to malate in the mitochondria. Other mutant alleles of the FH gene, located on human Chromosome 1 at position 1q42.1, cause multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. <b>Fumarase</b> deficiency {{is one of the few}} known deficiencies of the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, the main enzymatic pathway of cellular aerobic respiration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fumarase</b> (or fumarate hydratase) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{reversible}} hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate. <b>Fumarase</b> comes in two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic. The mitochondrial isoenzyme {{is involved in}} the Krebs Cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle TCA or the Citric Acid Cycle), and the cytosolic isoenzyme {{is involved in the}} metabolism of amino acids and fumarate. Subcellular localization is established by the presence of a signal sequence on the amino terminus in the mitochondrial form, while subcellular localization in the cytosolic form is established by the absence of the signal sequence found in the mitochondrial variety.|$|E
50|$|The glyoxylate cycle {{utilizes}} five of {{the eight}} enzymes associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle: citrate synthase, aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, <b>fumarase,</b> and malate dehydrogenase. The two cycles differ in that in the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate is converted into glyoxylate and succinate by ICL instead of into α-ketoglutarate. This bypasses the decarboxylation steps {{that take place in}} the TCA cycle, allowing simple carbon compounds {{to be used in the}} later synthesis of macromolecules, including glucose. Glyoxylate is subsequently combined with acetyl-CoA to produce malate, catalyzed by MS. Malate is also formed in parallel from succinate by the action of succinate dehydrogenase and <b>fumarase.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fumarase</b> {{deficiency}} (or fumaric aciduria), {{also known}} as [...] "Polygamist Down's", is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme fumarate hydratase, which is indicated by a buildup of fumaric acid in the urine.|$|E
50|$|Crystal {{structures}} of <b>fumarase</b> C from Escherichia coli {{have been observed}} to have two occupied dicarboxylate binding sites. These are known as the active site and the B site. The active site and B site are both identified as having areas unoccupied by a bound ligand. This so-called ‘free’ crystal structure demonstrates conservation of the active-site water. Similar orientation has been discovered in other <b>fumarase</b> C crystal structures. Crystallographic research on the B site of the enzyme has observed {{that there is a}} shift on His129. This information suggests that water is a permanent component of the active site. It also suggests that the use of an imidazole-imidazolium conversion controls access to the allosteric B site.|$|E
