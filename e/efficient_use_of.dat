5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|Besides Baldwin's own writings, {{there is}} a decretal {{collection}} known as the Collectio Wigorniensis, still extant in manuscript (MS) form. It now resides in the British Library as Royal MS 10.A.ii. This collection may have belonged to Baldwin. It was probably compiled at Worcester Cathedral before December 1184, when Baldwin went to Canterbury, and besides a basic collection of Pope Alexander III's decretals it includes a number of letters from the papacy addressed to Baldwin as Bishop of Worcester and as Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the main contents are unexceptional, the compiler of the work numbered the books and capitula into which the work was divided, an innovation that allowed for much more <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the collection. It {{is likely that the}} compiler was one of Baldwin's clerks, and that this testified to Baldwin's continuing interest in canon law. The manuscript itself was likely owned either by Baldwin himself or a member of his household.|$|E
30|$|The {{formation}} of an RTA is expected to generate various implications for agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting member countries. This is because the {{formation of}} an RTA, which promotes intra-regional increases in agricultural trade flows, would eventually magnify market competition levels. In this context, several studies (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Frankel, 1997; Perdikis, 2007) noted that reductions in regional and bilateral trade barriers would not only decrease market prices, but would also compel firms in RTAs’ member countries to upgrade their production technologies and to realize more <b>efficient</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> inputs.|$|R

This paper discusses bootstrapping {{as a creative}} financing strategy. Bootstrapping has been advocated in, and documented by, the popular business press. Two methods that broadly address bootstrapping are identified and discussed. These two methods include the acquisition and control of resources (both tangible and intangible), and the <b>efficient</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> those resources to finance the enterprise for growth. Examples of bootstrapping activities are presented to illustrate each method. The paper also provides a short-list of practical suggestions for bootstrapping start-up businesses...|$|R

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more <b>efficient</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
