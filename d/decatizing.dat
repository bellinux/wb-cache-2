50|$|There {{are several}} quite {{different}} types of wool <b>decatizing</b> machines including batch <b>decatizing</b> machines, continuous <b>decatizing</b> machines, wet decatising machines and dry <b>decatizing</b> machines.|$|E
50|$|Decatized wool {{fabric is}} {{interleaved}} with a cotton, polyester/cotton or polyester fabric and rolled up onto a perforated <b>decatizing</b> drum under controlled tension. The fabric is steamed {{for up to}} ten minutes and then cooled down by drawing ambient air through the fabric roll. The piece is then reversed and steamed again {{in order to ensure}} that an even treatment is achieved.|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, NEA {{produced}} hydraulic presses, <b>decatizing</b> rollers, reciprocating steam-powered {{engines and}} napping mills. Additionally, NEA serviced defective existing machines of customers. In 1888, the company {{moved into a}} new and larger production hall in the Clasenstra√üe, near the Aachen West railway station. In the year 1891, Oscar Peters presided as the sole owner of the machinery factory. Since then, Neuman & Esser has been owned by the Peters family.|$|E
5000|$|Decatising or <b>decatizing,</b> {{also known}} as crabbing, blowing, and decating, {{is the process of}} making {{permanent}} a textile finish on a cloth, so that it does not shrink during garment making. The word comes from the French , which means to remove the [...] or finish of the wool. Though used mainly for wool, the term is also applied to processes performed on fabrics of other fibers, such as cotton, linen or polyester. Crabbing and blowing are minor variations on the general process for wool, which is to roll the cloth onto a roller and blow steam through it.|$|E
40|$|The {{excellence}} in quality of Italian wool fabrics, which ensures a worldwide leader {{position of the}} Biella district, depends fundamentally on three factors: the design, distinctive of the "Made in Italy", the choice of very fine fibers and the adoption of particular finishing techniques, which ensure optimal physical characteristics especially for the tailorability of light fabrics with a special "hand". Among the fundamental steps of the wool textile production, finishing is certainly the one that, still nowadays, depends largely on empirical knowledge. A critical review, aimed at rationalizing the process considering both the costs and the quality guarantee, requires the realization of two preliminary conditions: understanding physicochemical parameters and laws which rule {{the process and the}} development of measuring methods which allow to objectively evaluate the influence of the controlling variables. In the majority of finishing processes, the fabric is exposed to the action of water or steam, in different conditions. The main goal of finishing is relaxation and/or stabilization of internal stresses at molecular level (the so-called "setting") generated by the complex macromolecular structure of wool fibers. This can be made by means of three basic operations: steaming, <b>decatizing</b> at atmospheric pressure and <b>decatizing</b> under pressure (KD). Actually, the last operation is the most critical one, because it is realized wrapping the textile material on a perforated drum, through which steam is fed. The whole operation is led in an autoclave, at variable temperature and pressure, depending on the textile product. A KD operation affects disulfide bonds, bringing about their redistribution, with a permanent effect. This action, called setting, is given by a fine tuning of the process variables: temperature, moisture content, treatment time and mechanical pressure. All these four variables interact reciprocally but their relationships have not been fully understood; therefore a scientific criterion is fundamental for rationalizing sequence and intensity of the operations. To reach these goals, two different approaches were adopted in the present work. The first one was based on a set of experiments on suitable bench scale equipments, carried out to monitor the process parameters (particularly temperature and moisture content) during the treatments and within the textile structure. The second approach concerns the development of theoretical models, whose application in a computer algorithm, thanks to a finite elements based simulation software, allowed to simulate the system behavio...|$|E
40|$|Polyester fibers (PET) {{are greatly}} used in {{textiles}} but depend on fossil fuel resources. Poly-(lactic acid) (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester {{that can be}} derived from 100 % renewable resources. The load-extension plot of a polylactide fiber seems to be especially compatible with that of wool. Consequently polyester/wool 55 / 45 and polylactide/wool 55 / 45 yarns were spun using the Sirospun process and plain and twill woven fabrics were industrially produced. Washed and heat set fabrics were subjected to a conventional process of dyeing and <b>decatizing.</b> Fabrics were gradually worn by abrasion using a Martindale wear and abrasion tester.; Using the bursting strength test, the viscoelastic behavior of the fabrics when multidirectional extended was simulated and modeled using a modified non-linear Maxwell model. The three steps of fiber decrimping and orientation, fiber stretching and maximum yield and breaking were analyzed. PET/wool fabrics show a more linear behavior than PLA/wool ones and the influence of weave, finishing and wearing on the viscoelastic behavior of PLA/wool fabrics were highly relevant when compared with that on PET/wool ones. It seems that when blended with PET, wool develops its felting effect during finishing and wearing, while when blended with PLA, the felting effect of wool is hardly developed due to the lower resistance of PLA to hydrolysis and its lower thermal stability. PLA fiber properties need to be improved probably through the development of new L-D lactide (PLDLA) copolymers of different ratios between components and molecular weights to reach the optimal desirable properties for the fiber.
