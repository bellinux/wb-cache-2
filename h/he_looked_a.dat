5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little soft at times".|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> {{bit like}} santa actually, but it's not him it's Jon Blund.|$|R
5000|$|Dimmy - A defender, who {{is quite}} dim, hence his name. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like Plug from the Bash Street Kids.|$|R
50|$|The {{teacher of}} the school in which Hello Kitty and her friends study. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like Anthony, the {{grandfather}} of Kitty.|$|R
2500|$|Mike Maddux {{was drafted}} in 1982. When scouts went {{to observe the}} elder Maddux, their father Dave told them, [...] "You will be back later for the little one." [...] Some {{baseball}} scouts were unimpressed by Maddux's skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, [...] "I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country if only <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> bit more physical." ...|$|E
2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I thought <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> bit weird after the show—I didn't know that he'd taken a whole bloody bottle of weird-looking {{psychiatric}} pills. It {{was a bad}} time. Ray suddenly {{announced that he was}} going to end it all ... I think he took the pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a bit crazy. I didn't know what happened—I suddenly got a phone call saying he was in the hospital. I remember going to the hospital after they'd pumped his stomach and it was bad.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show {{him with a}} goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times {{he had a big}} afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I? Not at all,' said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>an</b> astonishment at her inquiry which {{a slight}} twinkle {{of his eye}} half belied. 'But you do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't t'ink <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> {{bit like}} me," [...] said Caesar, with disgust, as he {{surveyed}} his young master {{with his new}} complexion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} at dinner-time we had better ask the man we work for. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> good-natured sort of chap. He may know of someone he could {{recommend}} us to." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the fourth Test of the series against India in 1962 that Nurse was given another {{opportunity}} at Test level. Nurse was made only one run in the first innings and in the secon innings was 46 not {{out at the end of}} the matchthe West Indies won by 7 wickets. Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the nice things claimed for him. He got himself out far too often through always being in too big a hurry to get on with the scoring, but in August <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> very fine player." [...] He was given another opportunity to succeed in the sub-continent with a Commonwealth XI tour of Pakistan in 1963. Nurse scored 369 runs in six matches on tour including 126 not out in the final match against Pakistan at Dacca Stadium.|$|E
60|$|Spencer stood {{squarely}} {{upon his}} feet. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little tired.|$|E

5000|$|Elmo is a {{deceased}} pink-skinned, non-humanoid alien with immense eyes and tentacles who can [...] "dampen" [...] the energy level of other beings. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> {{lot like the}} later member Waxworks.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the story, Roy {{is driving}} the bus and looks in the mirror to an empty seat, but when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> second time, Nathan is there smiling at him.|$|R
5000|$|Kermit the Frog: What's {{wrong with}} the drummer? <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little crazed.Zoot: Oh, he's just upset about missing the Rembrandt exhibit at The National Gallery.Animal: him in a wild, angry tone Renoir!! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little shamefaced, and {{his light}} eyes {{were full of}} {{something}} like contrition.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} clear that he was not pleased to see him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little uneasy.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused and}} looked upon her with a face of wrath, into which there stole, as <b>he</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>a</b> twinkle of humour.|$|E
6000|$|Drysdale grinned. [...] "Some big stanes fell on t' ram when Mayson was Bringing flock doon Barra ghyll. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> bit the waur o' it, but you {{can tell}} the Carlside blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The son of {{your brother}} {{who was killed}} {{with his wife in}} that dreadful Alpine accident? <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> very decided sort of young man. He's got that new look. What is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The last of {{the crew}} needs especial remark, [...] Though <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>an</b> {{incredible}} dunce: [...] He had just one idea--but, that one being [...] "Snark," [...] The good Bellman engaged him at once.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Warburton {{listened with}} interest; he seemed struck with this account of Edward Rosier. [...] "Dear me; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> well-set-up young fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|No: {{that was}} not what he was in search of. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little lower down: and read on regularly, from that point, as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speech? Great guns! I {{never made}} a speech in my life," [...] {{announced}} Tom, and {{now for the first}} time <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> bit confused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> sort of diabolically funny, [...] "the harpooneer {{is a dark}} complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don't-- he eats {{nothing but}} steaks, and he likes 'em rare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is hard to}} tell," [...] {{said the}} man thoughtfully. [...] "You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like <b>a</b> bird; and some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like <b>an</b> elephant; and some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like <b>a</b> cat. To others he appears as a {{beautiful}} fairy, or a brownie, {{or in any other}} form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|The typewritten words danced {{before his}} eyes. The {{description}} of a green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>an</b> agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter replied to it: ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he passed}} along the street, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little anxious. Sherlock Holmes--and {{possibly}} even Doctor Watson--would have deduced {{that he had}} something on his conscience.|$|E
60|$|But {{now that}} his anger was over <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little frightened. Felicity was not there. We found her in the kitchen, {{lighting}} up the fire.|$|E
60|$|Each time I saw Ellesworth <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little shabbier {{than the}} last. Then {{one day he}} called me up on the telephone, and made an appointment.|$|E
60|$|METELLUS. I should not, Caesar. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> spoilsport. There are men {{in whose}} {{presence}} {{it is impossible}} to have any fun: men who are a sort of walking conscience. He would make us all uncomfortable.|$|R
6000|$|Warming turned. [...] "And I {{have grown}} old too. I played cricket {{with him when}} I was still only <b>a</b> boy. And <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> young man still. Yellow perhaps. But that {{is a young man}} nevertheless." ...|$|R
60|$|Roy's countenance fell, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like <b>a</b> convicted culprit.|$|R
