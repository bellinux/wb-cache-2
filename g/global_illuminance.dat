40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{experimental}} validation of solar illuminance model for vertical plane surfaces against measured solar <b>global</b> <b>illuminance</b> at New Delhi. The paper also deals with computation of solar illuminance (daylight), both quantitatively and qualitatively, on four cardinal vertical surfaces at six Indian stations. The stations identified {{for the study}} are: New Delhi, Jodhpur, Pune, Kolkata, Shillong and Leh. Quantitative analysis of daily average solar illuminance shows {{that most of the}} stations under study receive maximum illuminance on north, east and west surfaces, during summer months of April–July, whereas the south surface receives maximum illuminance during winter months of November–February. Higher range of daily average solar illuminance on four vertical surfaces is evaluated as follows: 45 – 55  klx on south surface, 20 – 35  klx on west surface (all the stations except Pune), 20 – 30  klx on east (Pune) and 14 – 15  klx on north surface. Qualitative analysis shows that for the <b>global</b> <b>illuminance</b> in the range of 20 – 40  klx, for four vertical surfaces, the percentage of annual day time is: 3 – 8 % for north surface, 25 – 30 % for south surface, 20 – 30 % for west surface and 20 – 25 % for east surface...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSatellight was a 3 year-European {{research}} program (Jan. 1996 -March 1999) {{with the objective}} of making available on Internet a database of solar radiation and daylight for Western and Central Europe. The data was obtained by processing the information provided by the Meteosat satellite every 30 minutes. We first developed and validated models to derive radiation and daylight data on ground from the satellite measurements. Then, we produced two years of data: 1996 and 1997, and made it accessible via a web server (its address is www. satel-light. com). The server provides statistics on the direct, diffuse and <b>global</b> <b>illuminances</b> or irradiances, on horizontal or tilted plane, for various zones in Europe or for specific locations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed the}} Optical Light Pipe (OLP) as a feasible solution {{to solve the}} problem of insufficient daylighting in deep plan office spaces for predominantly sunny climates. It further combined the OLP with a Specular Light Shelf (SLS) to achieve uniform daylighting. This research was performed with an experimental setup of two 1 : 4 scale models of deep plan office spaces, modified from an earlier research on optical light pipe at College Station, TX. Blinds and shading devices were installed on the south fa?ade to provide daylight to the front zone of a 20 feet by 30 feet office module. The back zone was daylit by the OLP hidden in the plenum. The existing OLP design was optimized through computer aided ray-tracing. The SLS design was based on an earlier prototype designed at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL). Results were based on observations made on clear and cloudy sky days between February 3 rd and March 17 th. The OLP achieved more than 300 lux of average workplane illuminance for 7. 4 hours, when <b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> was greater than 40, 000 lux. It also achieved 200 lux of illuminance higher than an earlier prototype (Martins-Mogo, 2005) on workplane between 1000 hrs and 1630 hrs. It exhibited a glare free daylight distribution with luminance ratios well within prescribed limits on most of the vertical surfaces, with a relatively uniform illuminance distribution on back taskplane. OLP was better than windows with blinds and shading at providing diffuse daylight in backzone on a cloudy day, when <b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> was greater than 20, 000 lux. The OLP used in combination with SLS achieved more than 500 lux of average workplane illuminance for 6 hours, when <b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> was greater than 40, 000 lux. SLS also produced more uniform illuminance levels on the workplane at all times and on the leftwall at most times. However, it produced non-uniform luminance distribution on walls and ceiling and luminance ratios higher than allowable limits on the sidewall for some morning hours, and hence needed further refinement in design...|$|R
40|$|Daylight {{utilization}} is a {{key factor}} in achieving visual and thermal comfort, and energy savings in integrated building design. However, lack of measured data related to this topic has become a major challenge with the increasing need for integrating lighting concepts and simulations {{in the early stages of}} design procedures. The current paper deals with the values of daylight illuminance on horizontal and south facing vertical surfaces; the data are estimated using IESNA model and measured values of the horizontal and vertical illuminance, and a regression model with an acceptable linear correlation is obtained. The resultant illuminance frequency curves are useful for estimating daylight availability on south facing surfaces in Tehran. In addition, the relationship between indirect vertical illuminance and the corresponding <b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> is analyzed. A simple parametric equation is proposed in order to predict the vertical illumination on a shaded south facing surface. The equation correlates the ratio between the vertical and horizontal illuminance to the solar altitude and is used with another relationship for prediction of the vertical illuminance. Both equations show good agreement, which allows for calculation of indirect vertical illuminance on a south facing surface at any time throughout the year...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that environmental conditions in classrooms, and namely daylighting conditions, can influence students health, well-being and performance. In the last years several studies, dealing with the effects of environmental conditions in classrooms in the learning process, have been published (Winterbottom, & Wilkins, 2009; Barret, Zhang, Moffat, & Kobbacy, 2013). The daylight factor (DF) is the most used parameter in the characterization and quantification of daylight in buildings. The DF at a point of a plane inside a room is defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) between the daylight illuminance at that point in the interior of the room and the simultaneous exterior horizontal <b>global</b> <b>illuminance</b> due to a hemisphere of a sky of known or assumed luminance distribution (usually, a CIE overcast sky luminance distribution is considered). The DF reflects the effectiveness of daylight penetration in a particular room or space. The exterior daylight conditions may vary, but the DF remains constant, since the interior illuminances change proportionally to the simultaneous changes in the exterior daylight conditions (Santos, 2006) ...|$|E

The other four clusters (for both seasons and both types of semi-days) were characterized by fluctuations of the illuminance and an interchange of positive and negative anomalies, in different periods of the day, due to the formation and breakup of clouds. Four Clusters (Clusters 5 & 6 (Fig. 6 e, 6 f), for S-N and Clusters 2 & 4 (Fig. 8 b, 8 d), for N-S) of semi-days for summer were noteworthy for their strong negative anomalies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the lighting {{performance of a}} passive horizontal solar light pipe designed for deep floor plan buildings with open-plan configuration. The light pipe system was designed to deliver natural light {{at the back of}} deep-plan buildings (5 - 10 m from window wall) using an optimized geometry and high reflective materials. The current light pipe system was developed for latitude 30. 6 ?N in a predominantly sunny and clear sky location. A 360 ? rotating experimental room was built to test the light pipe performance at different orientations. The experimental room represents a section of a deep open plan office space of 3. 6 m high, 6. 1 m wide, 9. 1 m long, with an area of 56 m 2. Preliminary results of photometric measurements in a South-facing orientation have shown that on clear and partly cloudy days (<b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> GH, ranging 20, 000 - 120, 000 lux), the light pipe can provide at 8 m from the perimeter, between 300 to 2, 500 lux for about nine hours (9 : 00 am- 6 : 00 pm). The highest illuminance values (above 1, 000 lux) are achieved consistently between 10 : 30 am and 4 : 30 pm under clear sky conditions. Natural light is evenly distributed over the workplane; the sidelight window illuminates {{the front of the room}} and the light pipe system the back...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDesignand {{operation}} of buildings {{in view of}} optimal thermal and visual performance can benefit from deployment of appropriate simulation tools. Specifically, the design and configuration of building-integrated renewable energy systems (solar-thermal collectors and photovoltaic panels) can be effectively supported via reliable computation of incident solar radiation. Toward this end, advanced building energy and lighting simulation programs typically use high-resolution sky models. In this contest, the present contribution addresses the reliability of these models based on long-term high-resolution data collected at the observatory of the Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology at the Vienna University of Technology, Austria. This observatory is equipped with radiometric and photometric sensors to measure global and diffuses horizontal irradiance and <b>illuminance,</b> <b>global</b> vertical irradiance and illuminance of the four cardinal orientations, as well as sky radiance and luminance values for discrete sky patches. To evaluate the performance of two widely used sky models, we compared simulated and measured vertical irradiance values as well as patch radiance values.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{issues related}} to daylight in urban canyons in predominantly sunny climates. Reflected sunlight from obstructions and ground is a major contribution to the illumination of buildings in orientations and at times {{when the sun is}} behind the building. Physical measurements collected in an urban canyon in Lisbon showed a linear relationship between the <b>global</b> horizontal <b>illuminance</b> and the total vertical illuminance when the facade is not receiving direct sunlight. Further studies carried out with computer simulations with RADIANCE as well as analytical calculations confirmed this relationship, which is shown to be relatively stable throughout the year, with latitude and orientations and time of day 'when sunlight is reflected off obstructions and ground. Moreover, the slope of this linear relationship is relatively similar for different floor heights and canyon ratios. Thus, the equation is representative of the whole year condition and fairly robust for individual parameters. It may therefore be used for quick calculations in the initial design stages of the project. Daylight calculations are commonly based on the daylight factor method regardless of prevailing weather conditions. While this method may be used for overcast sky conditions, {{it can be argued that}} it is not appropriate for clear skies. A relationship emerged which forms the basis for the average total daylight factor calculation in an urban canyon, taking into consideration reflected sunlight. In a similar way to the average daylight factor it may be used as an indicator of how well lit the indoor environment is and allows for the sizing of windows under predominantly sunny climates. All the above gave the basis to the definition of guidelines for daylight and urban planning in Europe. Two different set of criteria are presented. They apply to predominantly overcast and clear sky conditions. Both, individually or combined, allow for daylight design in European climates.

40|$|AbstractSolar {{energy is}} {{abundant}} {{and capable of}} providing much of our energy needs. It has several uses: photovoltaic, biomass (wood energy, biogas, biofuel), daylighting. For each use, its potential depends on the match between the spectral response of the collector (silicon, retina photoreceptors.) and the local solar spectrum. Increasing the performance of solar technologies by {{making the most of}} its spectrum (sun plus sky), requires a better understanding of its long term variations. Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) could be used to produce routinely the spectral irradiance received in the plane of a solar collector and build this climatology, anywhere on earth. The accuracy of RTMs depends on how well daily atmospheric constituents are known at the site. This information is becoming available from satellite data. Spectral measurements are needed to validate the use of RTMs with satellite derived atmospheric information. Since 1992, ENTPE has been maintaining in Lyon, France, a measuring station specialized in daylight ([URL] This station is part of the IDMP network of the CIE (International Commission of Illumination). In 2012, we have decided to add continuous spectral measurements to our station. We chose to measure the spectral irradiance in 5 planes useful for daylight and photovoltaic applications: 1 direct (perpendicular to the sun), 4 global (horizontal, vertical north, vertical east, south inclined at 45 °). We decided to use 5 spectrometers (Ocean Optics USB 650 / 4000) coupled to optical fibers fitted with diffusers. This paper describes the measurement system, the calibration of its components, the error characterization related to the sun tracker, the optical fibers and the spectrometers. It also provides an outline of the automatic quality control which takes full benefit of the other measurements of the station (<b>global</b> <b>illuminance</b> on horizontal and vertical planes, direct normal irradiance). These measurements will be used (1) to validate atmospheric information from satellites as well as RTMs, (2) to produce long term variations of the solar spectrum in Lyon, France...|$|E
