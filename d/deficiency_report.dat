40|$|This {{study is}} {{about the quality of}} the work of {{external}} auditors as part of the broader corporate governance frame. It contributes new evidence to the U. S. ’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection research literature on the association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and audit quality, as well as between PCAOB inspection outcomes and client firms’ internal control systems and internal corporate governance. In hypothesising these relationships, agency theory and signalling theory are invoked. This study focuses on two rounds of PCAOB inspections to identify change that have occurred in these inspection outcomes and their practical implications for medium-to-small auditor firms and their business clients’ managers and investors. Three sets of hypotheses are generated in this study. A quantitative research method is applied in this study. The sample in this study consists of 806 inspection reports. They are several findings from this study. First, in relation to the association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and abnormal audit fees paid to auditors by client firms used to test the first hypothesis, the result suggests if there is an increase in abnormal audit fees then there will be an increased probability of obtaining a <b>deficiency</b> <b>report.</b> In terms of the association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and client firms’ effective internal controls used to test the second hypothesis, the result suggests if there is an improvement in client firms’ internal controls then auditors will have a decreased chance of obtaining a <b>deficiency</b> <b>report.</b> With regard to the association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and client firms’ internal corporate governance applied to test the third hypothesis in this study. This result suggests if client firms’ internal corporate governance is stronger thus client firms’ auditors are more likely to have a favourable PCAOB inspection outcome. However, the result is insignificant, while in the hypothesised direction, can not be claimed as supporting the third hypothesis. This study highlights the significant association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and positive abnormal audit fees paid to auditors by client firms and client firms’ effective internal controls as well. Finally, this study contributes to current PCAOB literature by examining the direct association between the PCAOB inspection outcomes and audit quality, client firms’ internal controls and client firms’ internal corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{describes}} Pratt & Whitney's process improvement activities on its <b>deficiency</b> <b>report</b> (DR) investigation {{process for the}} F 100 engine program between 2004 and 2006. The DR investigation process is a customer service function that addresses anomalous, "non-conforming" technical problems discovered in fielded military engines. Investigation of these problems is critical because it produces important operational information for users of the engine. In 2004 {{at the behest of}} the United States Air Force (USAF), it's largest customer, Pratt & Whitney began process improvement activity to address the growing number of overdue investigations - investigations taking longer than 120 days. Military Customer Support, an organization within Pratt & Whitney's Military Engines division, began an effort to drive down the number of overdue investigations and put in place a more robust process for managing DR investigations. In addition to providing description of and insights on DR investigation improvements, one question this case will attempt to address is: what were the mechanisms that led to improvement in the DR investigation process metrics and customer satisfaction with USAF...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of recombinant {{human growth hormone}} (GH) has resulted in investigation {{of the role of}} GH in adulthood and the effects of GH replacement in the GH-deficient adult. These studies have led to the recognition of a specific syndrome of GH-deficiency, characterized by symptoms, signs and investigative findings. Adults with long-standing growth hormone deficiency are often overweight, have altered body composition, with reduced lean body mass (LBM), increased fat mass (FM), reduced total body water and reduced bone mass. In addition, there is reduced physical and cardiac performance, altered substrate metabolism and an abnormal lipid profile predisposing to the development of cardiovascular disease. Adults with GH <b>deficiency</b> <b>report</b> reduced psychological well-being and quality of life. These changes may contribute to the morbidity and premature mortality observed in hypopituitary adults on conventional replacement therapy. GH treatment restores LBM, reduces FM, increases total body water and increases bone mass. Following GH therapy, increases are recorded in exercise capacity and protein synthesis, and "favourable" alterations occur in plasma lipids. In addition, psychological well-being and quality of life improve with replacement therapy. GH is well tolerated; adverse effects are largely related to fluid retention and respond to dose adjustment. It is likely that GH replacement will become standard therapy for the hypopituitary adult in the near future. The benefits of GH replacement in the GH-deficient adult have been unequivocally demonstrated in studies lasting up to 3 years. The results of longer term studies are awaited to determine whether these benefits are sustained over a lifetime...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceptance}} inspection of construction by Fluor Daniel Hanford (FDH) is performed to provide assurance that fabrication, construction, and installation are {{in accordance with}} approved contract documents. Approved contract documents used to perform inspections may include specifications, drawings, and contractor submittals such as fabrication drawings, procedures, etc. The amount or degree of inspection activity is tailored to the project {{as determined by the}} project team so that the effort and cost expended are commensurate with the importance of the facility in terms of function and safety. Inspections are documented to provide verification of the acceptability of the work performed. This document identifies the inspections and documentation forms to be provided. It is prepared and implemented with the understanding that the construction contractor is fully responsible for compliance with contract documents and for the quality of work performed. Inspections performed are in accordance with approved procedures. The Manager of Acceptance Inspection is responsible for the implementation of this plan and assignment of personnel for the work. Inspections are conducted by personnel who are qualified and certified, to perform their assigned task. The Acceptance Inspection Plan is organized in the Construction Specification Institute (CSI) format to cross reference design specification sections with sections of the AI Plan. In each AI Plan section the applicable specification section subject will be identified followed by the appropriate inspection requirements. General surveillances will be listed when applicable. Acceptance Inspection Reports are provided to document inspections not documented on a test report (i. e., Soil Test Data, Concrete Test Report, NDE/Weld Record, Leak/Pressure Test Certification, Backflow Device Test Report, Nonconformance Report, <b>Deficiency</b> <b>Report,</b> and/or Contractors testing forms) ...|$|E
40|$|Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is {{a chronic}} {{syndrome}} characterized by widespread pain. FMS {{is a collection}} of other symptoms and overlapping conditions contribute to complicate the diagnosis, the assessment and the treatment. Unknown etiology and none laboratory tests have been appropriately validated for the diagnosis of the disease. The comparison of protein patterns in body fluids of diseased and healthy subjects has the potential to identify new disease-specific biomarkers. Some purine nucleotide metabolism disorders such as myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) <b>deficiency</b> <b>report</b> symptoms similar to those seen in FMS. In consideration of what described above, we carried out a serum proteomic analysis of FMS patients with respect to control subjects searching potentially useful biomarkers for the disease. In addition, we evaluated serum purine metabolite concentrations in patients affected by FMS and the relationships between their levels and FMS clinical parameters. Twenty-two females affected by FMS (according to the American College of Rheumatology, 1990) and twenty-two healthy women were recruited as controls for analysis of purine metabolite. Sixteen females FMS and twelve controls were enrolled in the study for the analyses of the proteome. Proteomic analysis was performed by combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) and serum purine levels were quantified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC). In our study, using the proteomic approach, we have identified differentially expressed proteins, such as Transthyretin (TTR), Alpha- 1 Antitrypsin (A 1 AT) and Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP 4). The serum 4 concentrations of these proteins were significantly higher in FMS patients compared with healthy controls. TTR and RBP 4 are retinoid transporters, moreover retinoid dysfunction is related to oxidative stress as well as A 1 AT. These results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress could be implicated in the pathophysiology of FMS. Moreover, considerably higher serum concentration of inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine levels (p< 0. 001) and lower serum adenosine (p< 0. 05) were detected in the FMS patients when compared to healthy controls. Our data show a negative correlation between adenosine and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Our results suggest that purines, in particular adenosine and inosine, may be involved in pain transmission in fibromyalgia...|$|E

30|$|A {{recent review}} on {{secondary}} and micronutrients study in SSA indicated {{that regardless of}} their importance in increasing productivity, secondary and micronutrients were rarely studied; with macronutrients getting the most attention (Kihara et al. 2017). The review also indicated that application of S and micronutrients increased maze yield by 25 % and its agronomic efficiency improvement varied between 38 and 432  kg kg− 1 {{compared to the use}} of macronutrients alone. Though, micronutrient <b>deficiency</b> <b>reports</b> from cassava fields are very few, B, Cu, Fe, and Mn, <b>deficiencies</b> were <b>reported</b> from calcareous soils with high pH level, while Zn <b>deficiency</b> were <b>reported</b> both under acidic and alkaline soils (Howeler 2011). However, {{because of the fact that}} micronutrients deficiency and disease symptoms are most of the time similar, it is hard to detect micronutrients deficiencies in cassava fields (Hauser et al. 2014). In this research, the application of chicken manure improved all the micronutrient status in the soil, with significant improvement observed for Zn content in the soil. To the opposite, while Zn and Cu content in the soil declined, soil Mn and Fe content significantly improved with the application of mineral fertilizer, mainly at 8 and 12 MAP. A research from Malesia revealed that Cu was found to be the most limiting micronutrient for cassava production (Chew et al. 2008). In this research, the Cu released to the soil was statistically not significant following manure application—where we expect Cu release to the soil, while it was significantly reduced for the soils treated by NPK fertilizer—where we did not applied Cu. This may indicate that Cu is still important micronutrient for cassava production from this research too.|$|R
