County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex <b>electronic</b> <b>purse</b> (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integrated circuit {{cards or}} smart cards are now well-known. Applications such as <b>electronic</b> <b>purses</b> (cash units stored in cards), {{subscriber}} identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated circuit cards evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated circuit cards cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards. Operating systems based on object-oriented technologies are key components for future integrated circuit cards applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a method to}} compute with encrypted rational numbers. It is well-known that homomorphic schemes allow calculations with hidden integers, i. e. given integers x and y encrypted in E(x) and E(y), one can compute the encrypted sum E(x + y) or the encrypted product E(kx) of the encrypted integer x and a known integer k without having to decrypt the terms E(x) or E(y). Such cryptosystems {{have a lot of}} applications in electronic voting schemes, lottery or in multiparty computation since they allow to keep the privacy of the terms and return the result in encrypted form. However, from a practical point of view, it might be interesting to compute with rationals.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the impact of payment cards use on the amount of money in {{circulation}} in Belgium. In all developed countries the amout of notes and coins has decreased over the past years. Such tendency can be attributed to a slow, but continuous process of substitution of cash by other means of payment for everyday transactions. If the substitution was first due to a widespread used of cheques, more recently this was intensified by cards' diffusion. This claim is supported by several empirical studies reviewed in this paper. They confirm the role of cards, together with their infrastructure (ATMs and EFT-POS terminals), in decreasing the number of cash transactions. We study a money demand model in Belgium through a co- integration analysis, where money is a function of structural variables, as well as some variables reflecting card's use in order to account for the substitution effect. We find that cards (debit, credit and, more recently, <b>electronic</b> <b>purses)</b> significantly contributed to the long run reduction of outstanding currency in Belgium over the last forty years. We extended the long run analysis into a more general error-correction model where short run imbalances significantly adjust to the long run relationship. Currency appears to respond quite slowly to disequilibria. Finally, we examine the dynamics of the model by means of impulse response functions that forecast the future developments of money demand.

40|$|The report {{contains}} {{results from}} a project by the European Science and Technology Observatory (ESTO). It contains a series of country-specific analyses on existing payment systems and ongoing or planned initiatives, in particular for electronic money, covering ten European countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The country analysis contain information on payment cultures, national frameworks for banking and financial services, payment cards, <b>electronic</b> <b>purses,</b> Internet payment systems and electronic commerce {{in each of the}} countries. For the purposes of the report, analysis of electronic commerce is restricted to the business to consumer (B:C) segment. The country chapters are followed by a discussion of the issues raised across the countries. The final section presents a summary of the most important findings of the study. The report reveals vast national differences and peculiarities which will have great impact on the spread of electronic payment systems and electronic commerce in the individual countries. It also shows that use of electronic money is only at the experimental stage and that traditional national 'access products' are finding use on the Internet for domestic transactions. While Internet commerce at the national level is growing impressively, trans-border commerce is only just starting. Here, there will be a demand for a uniform and unambiguous framework, especially with respect to legal aspects. In addition an infrastructure is required enabling interoperability of a broad range of existing and emerging payment methods. (orig.)
