He predicted that [...] "their {{campaign against the}} film is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared {{to speak out against}} the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E

[...] Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that [...] "William Fichtner is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> actor on any show this season.

[...] Hoppus felt the band achieved the purest, cleanest sound on the record {{that they had been}} striving for. Finn felt similarly, proud of his work on the record and believing in retrospect that the album would appeal to the masses. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. [...] "The Party Song" [...] was the final song to be completed, and the three were mixing the song coincidentally when lead single [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] premiered on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., best known for his work with Beck, played keyboards for several songs on the album. After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2013, Hoppus referred to Enema of the State as [...] "the heart of Blink-182's musical sensibilities," [...] singling out [...] "its simplicity, its purity, its singularity of purpose between the three of us." [...] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.|$|E

2500|$|Like SN2 {{reaction}}s, {{there are}} quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. [...] Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. [...] The rate equation for this would be Rate=k. [...] Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group [...] "leaves" [...] determines the speed of the reaction. [...] This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. [...] A general rule for what makes a good leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. [...] In this case, halogens are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are going to be quite poor leaving groups. [...] As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. [...] Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. [...] In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. [...] It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. [...] The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. [...] It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. [...] It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.|$|E
