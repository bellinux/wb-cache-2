40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour {{of novel}} multifunctional a-hydroxymethylated nitroalkenes was studied {{with respect to}} oxidation of –OH moiety and reduction of nitro group using the cyclic voltammetric technique at glassy carbon and <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> carbon paste electrodes with sulphuric acid as the supporting electrolyte. The –OH moiety attached to the nitroalkene side chain was found to undergo irreversible four electrons electrochemical oxidation to form an acid at the glassy carbon electrode but no oxidation was observed at the <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> car-bon paste electrode. Oxidation in sulphuric acid medium becomes easier with increasing the sulphuric acid concentration. This unusual behaviour is attributed {{to the formation of}} a six-membered cyclic structure at lower concentrations of sulphuric acid due to intramolecular hy-drogen bonding.

This report contains {{the results of a}} one year study to develop improved methods of evaporation control using <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> foam. The foam used was expanded polystyrene and the wax used was paraffin with a 140 ° F melting point. The report tells of a pressure chamber that was used to <b>wax</b> <b>impregnate</b> sheets of expanded polystyrene. Based on tests made in the laboratory the pressure chamber was modified into a vacuum chamber. Problems were encountered getting the interior of the sheets impregnated using a vacuum. There was no way this problem could have been predicted based on the smaller laboratory models. The pressure method, however, was successfully used to impregnate up to 3 -inch thick sheets of expanded polystyrene. During the project {{it was found that the}} paraffin impregnated rafts worked very well until high temperatures, 100 ° F plus, are encountered Under dusty conditions. The heat causes the surface of the wax to get tacky, the dust darkens the otherwise white surface, which in turn captures more heat, and then more dust, etc. The high surface temperature caused an accelerated weathering of the material. Because of this, waxes with higher melting points were tried. Additional work is needed in this area as no satisfactory combinations were found. Two polyethylene copolymers with a melting point close to the 190 ° F destruction point of the expanded polystyrene were tested. This wax was too viscous for impregnation but provided a hard surface coating when the previously <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> expanded polystyrene is dipped into the molten polyethylene wax. This dipping might be the best method for surface protection at low cost but additional testing is needed before trying the material out on a large scale. Progress was made in the development of <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> lightweight concrete rafts. The wax impregnation of the lightweight raft solves the vapor penetration problem. This type of raft was found to resist removal by wind and weathered very well in the one year of testing. Connecting rafts with strips of sheet metal bonded to the expanded polystyrene was done on a small scale, and needs to be field tested. The PVC pipe C clamps work well on partially submerged rafts but need to be lengthened to interconnect <b>wax</b> <b>impregnated</b> rafts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{the use of a}} new class of materials for realizing soft robots. Specifically, meso-scale composites [...] composed of cellular solids impregnated with active fluids-were be designed to have controllable stiffness to {{take the form of a}} continuous body of a soft robot. This represents an improvement compared to past efforts in soft robotics, which often involved modifying the infrastructure of current, rigid robots to yield softer ones. This latter approach often faced the challenges of developing actuators that were "soft" but still discrete, and were limited in performance. In contrast, the controllable-stiffness composites proposed in this thesis eliminate the need for multiple actuators; a single structure can transition between various states to serve as both rigid, load-bearing components as well as morphable, compliant ones. While the vast range of fluid-foam combinations for such an application have yet to be explored, the work presented here focuses on a specific composite: open-cell polyurethane foam <b>impregnated</b> with <b>wax.</b> This type of composite can be thermally activated to exhibit both solid and nearly fluid states (while the wax can be melted to become a fluid, the foam holds the composite together as a pseudo-solid). This thesis discusses the research that has been conducted to 1) characterize the mechanical properties of wax-foam composites as well as 2) investigate possible ways in which the composites can be used as robotic components. by Nadia G.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} application of additive manufacturing techniques for fabricating hybrid rocket fuel grains composed of porous Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene <b>impregnated</b> with paraffin <b>wax.</b> The digitally manufactured ABS substrate provides mechanical support for the paraffin fuel material and serves as an additional fuel component. The embedded paraffin provides an enhanced fuel regression rate while having no detrimental effect on the thermodynamic burn properties of the fuel grain. Multiple fuel grains with various ABS-to-Paraffin mass ratios were fabricated and burned with nitrous oxide. Analytical predictions for end-to-end motor performance and fuel regression are compared against static test results. Baseline fuel grain regression calculations use an enthalpy balance energy analysis with the material and thermodynamic properties based on the mean paraffin/ABS mass fractions within the fuel grain. In support of these analytical comparisons, a novel method for propagating the fuel port burn surface was developed. In this modeling approach the fuel cross section grid is modeled as an image with white pixels representing the fuel and black pixels representing empty or burned grid cells. (80 pages...|$|R

A laboratory no-choice test with Reticulitermes banyulensis Clément {{was carried out in}} Valencia (Spain) under Mediterranean conditions for eight weeks. Scots pine sapwood (Pinus sylvestris L.) fully <b>impregnated</b> with distinct <b>waxes</b> was used. Two field trials were conducted with Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt) and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt in northern Queensland (Australia) with wax-impregnated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for 16 weeks. All three subterranean termites are of major economic importance in their respective regions. The results indicated that feeding pressure by the termites was sufficient within all trials for a valid test. Wax-impregnated Scots pine sapwood was classified as durable. No termites survived the test. The results showed an aging process under submersion conditions, which lead to a classification of moderately durable. The paraffin treatment showed good termite resistance under both test procedures, and was classified as durable. The Australian field trials showed a decreased mass loss of wax-treated beech, in which an amide wax showed excellent termite resistance.

Bacterial cellulose was converted into carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) {{with a novel}} three-dimensional web built of entangled and interconnected cellulose ribbons when the carbonization temperature was below 1, 200 °C; the web-like structure was destroyed at a temperature of 1, 400 °C. Composites of CBC <b>impregnated</b> with paraffin <b>wax</b> exhibited high complex permittivity over a frequency range of 2 to 18 GHz, depending on the carbonization temperature. Both real and imaginary parts were the highest for CBC pyrolyzed at 1, 200 °C. The complex permittivity also strongly depended on CBC loadings. For 7.5 wt.% loading, the real and imaginary permittivities were about 12 and 4.3, respectively, and the minimum reflection loss was - 39 dB at 10.9 GHz. For 30 wt.% loading, the real and imaginary permittivities were about 45 and 80, respectively, and the shielding efficiency was more than 24 dB in the measured frequency range and could be up to 39 dB at 18 GHz. The electromagnetic properties were assumed to correlate with both the dielectric relaxation and the novel web-like structure.|$|R

The {{activity of the}} free and immobilized enzymes {{as a function of}} pH, temperature, storage stability, kinetic parameters and periodic use were compared. The immobilized enzyme showed good storage stability. After repeated use, the alginate beads turned brown and deteriorated, hence the storage stability was not good. The paraffin films were preserved dry because during wet preservation, the film slightly softened and the protein leached out slightly. The alginate beads had moderate mechanical stability. The lac films were tougher than the paraffin wax films in terms of mechanical stability. The K m and V max values were altered after immobilization. The K m values for calcium alginate and lac were low, while it was larger in paraffin film as compared to the free enzyme. This {{may be due to the}} fact that immobilization on calcium alginate and lac in presence of CaCl 2 and methanol exposed certain active sites of the urease.

The morphology was studied using {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transformation-Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrometer and the thermal properties were measured using laser flash analyser (LFA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermal cycling. LFA showed a 101. 2 % and 94. 5 % increase in the thermal conductivity of P-GONP compared to pure paraffin (P) in solid and liquid state respectively.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die für den radialen Stofftransport durch die Wurzel Höherer Pflanzen wichtigen apoplastischen Barrieren der Wurzeln von sieben Pflanzenarten (Vicia faba L.; Typha glauca Godr.; Ricinus communis L.; Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.; Fagus sylvatica L.; Picea abies (L.) Karst.; Zea mays L.) mikroskopisch charakterisiert und chemisch analysiert. Nach enyzmatischer Isolation der Gewebe wurde die Biopolymerzusammensetzung von Suberin und Lignin der isolierten Zellwände nach Depolymerisierung durch Umesterungsreaktion (Abbau von Suberin) oder Thioacidolyse (Abbau von Lignin) mittels Gaschromatographie und Massenspektroskopie aufgeklärt. Außerdem wurde Sprossknollenperiderm der Kartoffel (Solanum tuberosum L.) verschiedener {{post harvest}} Luftfeuchtebedingungen, sowie neugeformtes Wundperiderm chemisch-analytisch und auf die Permeabilität für Wasser hin untersucht. Zusätzlich zu den mikroskopischen und chemischen Analysen wurden die hydraulischen Leitfähigkeiten von Maiswurzeln verschiedener Kulturbedingungen und die Aufnahme von Rubidium-Ionen über die Maiswurzeln untersucht. Dabei wurde die Auswirkung von Salzstress (100 mM NaCl), und eine Applikation des Phytohormons Abscisinsäure (10 µM ABA) bei der Aufzucht der Pflanzen auf apoplastische Barrieren untersucht. Auch die Rubidiumaufnahme von bei Nitratmangel (0. 00 M NO 3 -) aufgewachsenen Rizinuspflanzen wurde ermittelt und mit der chemischen Zusammensetzung der apoplastischen Barrieren korreliert. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit zeigen, dass: -monocotyle Pflanzen wesentlich höhere Aromatenanteile im Suberin apoplastischer Barrieren besitzen als dicotyle Pflanzen; -bei der Bewertung des Suberingehaltes apoplastischer Barrieren histochemische Methoden unzureichend sind; -die Flächenbelegung mit Suberin auch innerhalb gleicher Entwicklungsstadien bei verschiedenen Pflanzen stark unterschiedlich sein kann; -der Verknüpfungsgrad der Monomeren im Suberin stark unterschiedlich sein kann; -Suberin keine 100 %ige Barriere für Wasser und Ionen darstellt; -Suberin auch eine Barriere gegen unkontrollierte Gasdiffusion darstellen kann; -der Stofftransport (z. B. Rb-Ionen) durch zusätzliche Suberinmengen verlangsamt werden kann, geringere Suberinmengen den Stofffluss aber nicht signifikant erhöhen wie bei Nitratmangelpflanzen gezeigt wurde; -eine direkte Ableitung der Funktion für den Wasser und Stofftransport aus dem Suberingehalt nicht ohne eine Extraktanalyse der Gewebe möglich ist, und in jedem Fall die Notwendigkeit besteht eine Flächenbelegung mit Suberin oder Wachsen zu ermitteln; -die Variabilität von Pflanzen verschiedenen Genotyps und die Entwicklung vieler verschiedener Anpassungsstrategien zum Schutz vor Stress eine Abschätzung funktioneller Aspekte aus monokausaler Sichtweise (z. B. : Suberingehalt) unmöglich macht. Um der Vielfältigkeit pflanzlicher Strategien gerecht zu werden, ist daher die Integration vieler unterschiedlicher Untersuchungsmethoden in interdisziplinärer Arbeitsweise notwendig. The {{aim of this}} thesis {{was to examine the}} {{chemical}} composition of suberised apoplastic barriers in roots of higher plants and to relate the obtained results to the function of these barrier tissues for the diffusive transport of ions and water. For the analysis of the chemical composition (mainly suberin and also lignin), the roots were digested enzymatically, and the remaining material was separated in two fractions: one fraction consisting of rhizodermal and hypodermal cell walls (RHCW) and the second one of endodermal cell walls (ECW). Xylem vessels were not analised. Suberin content of the isolated cell walls was determined after transesterification and GC/FID and GC/MS analysis of the monomers. Prior to the chemical analysis, the anatomical structures of the roots were thoroughly examined with light microscopy using histochemical dyes and UV-light as well as scanning electron microscopy. Analysis were performed on the roots of several species: Vicia faba L., Typha glauca Godr., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Fagus sylvatica L., Picea abies (L.) Karst., Rhicinus communis L. and Zea mays L. To reveal functional aspects for the transport of water through suberised barriers, potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum L.) skin was used as a model system because it is easy to obtain and consists to more than 20 % of suberin. Additionally it is <b>impregnated</b> with aliphatic <b>wax</b> like materials. Experiments with freshly harvested potatoes showed, that suberin and wax content increased in the first days after cutting the tubers from the stele, but no additional cell layers were build. As the content of aliphatic components increased in the peridermal cell walls, the water permeability decreased. Removal of the waxes increased the water permeability of potato periderm to more than a 100 fold from 5. 4 &# 8729; 10 - 11 m s- 1 to 8. 0 &# 8729; 10 - 9 m s- 1 for the extracted ones. Surprisingly, {{there was no significant difference}} in the water permeability of periderms with different suberin content. 28 day old periderms had approx. twice as much as the suberin from freshly harvested ones, but the difference in permeability was smaller than 0. 4 units. These results are showing, that suberin is not a water tight barrier as it is discussed in common text books, but to a certain extend it controls the water flux. Suberin amounts and permeabilities where used to estimate hypothetical transport data for root tissues, but the calculated values were only roughly in the range of measured root hydraulic permeabilities obtained from pressure probe experiments. Pressure probe experiments with roots of 8 day old maize seedlings showed, that a higher suberin content in the exodermis significantly reduces the radial water flow through the roots. Even the ion flux in maize roots is reduced, when barrier tissues contained more suberin. These results were obtained in experiments with rubidium-ions as a tracer for potassium-ions in maize seedlings. Apoplastic root barrier tissues, especially the endodermis were strongly enhanced, when the plants were grown under 100 mM NaCl or with 10 µM of the stress-hormone abscisic acid in the hydroponic growth-solution. On the other hand, it was shown that plants of the same species but with different genotypes responded each in a different way to stress situations. For example, whilest maize genotype Pioneer 3906 was able to cope with high salt concentrations, without altering apoplastic barriers, the genotype Across 8023 showed strong enhancement with high suberin amounts of the endodermal cell walls at the same salt concentrations. Lack of nutrients (e. g. : nitrate) in castor bean hydroponic culture leads to low suberin content in the endodermis but the uptake ability for rubidium-ions was not affected at all. Analysis of broad bean root nodules showed the relevance of high suberin amounts as a barrier for water and solutes as well as for gases. Suberin content in nodules were much higher than in the root apoplastic barriers, for that it would concluded, that the uncontrolled diffusion of oxygen into the infected zone of the nodule was inhibited by large amounts of suberin in the nodule endodermis. Another hint to this idea was the analysis of Typha glauca roots and rhizomes, which had more suberin in the exodermis than in the endodermis (in maize it was vice versa), because the submerged tissues are full of air-filled intercellular spaces and the function of higher suberin amounts in the exodermis may be to prevent oxygen loss. The results of this thesis are showing that suberin is a variable material with several functions, not only as a transport barrier for water, ions and gases which controls to a certain extend the fluxes in and out of the apoplast, but also as a barrier against pathogens with high contents of aromatic materials...|$|R
