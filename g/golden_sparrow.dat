5|$|Hartlaub {{considered}} the chestnut sparrow's colouration and morphology to be distinct enough to allocate {{it to its}} own monotypic genus, Sorella. Although a few authors have followed Hartlaub's treatment, it is usually placed in the genus Passer. It {{is very similar to}} the two golden sparrows, from which it may have once been only clinally different. The male Arabian <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow</b> is almost entirely gold-coloured, the male chestnut sparrow is mostly chestnut, and the male Sudan <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow</b> is intermediate between the two. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen {{considered the}}se three species to be conspecific; however, the range of the Sudan <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow</b> overlaps with that of the chestnut sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Sudan. These species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males quiver their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in a clump of trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow</b> have been reported.|$|E
500|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow (Passer eminibey) is {{a species}} of passerine bird in the sparrow family Passeridae. It is the smallest member of the sparrow family, at about [...] long. The breeding male has deep chestnut plumage and the female and juvenile are coloured a duller grey with some chestnut markings. Like its closest relatives in the genus Passer, the Arabian <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the Sudan <b>golden</b> <b>sparrow,</b> it is gregarious and found in arid areas. Ranging through the east of Africa from Darfur in Sudan to Tanzania, it is found in dry savanna, papyrus swamps, and near human habitation. Adults and juveniles both feed mostly on grass seeds, and fly in flocks, often with other species of birds, to find food. It nests in trees, building its own domed nests, and also usurping the more elaborate nests of weavers.|$|E

5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the <b>golden</b> <b>sparrows,</b> it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the <b>golden</b> <b>sparrows,</b> it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|R
50|$|Grain-eating species, in {{particular}} the house and Sudan <b>golden</b> <b>sparrows,</b> can be significant agricultural pests. Sparrows can be beneficial to humans as well, especially by eating insect pests. Attempts at the large-scale control of sparrows have failed to affect sparrow populations significantly, or have been accompanied by major increases in insect attacks probably resulting from a reduction of sparrows, as in the Great Sparrow Campaign in 1950s China.|$|R

40|$|The Red-billed Quelea (Quelga quelaa), {{because of}} its {{widespread}} destruction of grain crops throughout its range in Africa, {{is one of the}} most studied and written about granivorous bird species. Less publicized are more local bird pests in Africa which may be equally Important. The Village Weaver, (Ploceus cucullatus), for example, is a pest in many countries, while some other Ploecids with limited destructive habits create local problems. Significant crop losses also occur where there are large populations of <b>Golden</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Passer luteus), House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), Red Bishops (Euplectes oryx), Doves (Streptopelia spp.), Glossy Starlings (Lamprotornis chalybaeus), Parakeets (Psittacula spp.), and some waterfowl (Mackworth-Praed and Grant, 1952; Pans Manual No. 3, 1974; Park, 1974). Crop losses from local bird pests were reported in early February 1975 to the Sudan Plant Protection Bird Control Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. A mechanized farm scheme in Khartoum North had large concentrations of Red Bishops roosting in maize and feeding on an early-maturing wheat variety (Mexicana). Small flocks of <b>Golden</b> <b>Sparrows</b> and House Sparrows also were present. Bird damage was clearly visible, especially at the corners and along the edges of the ripening wheatfields. Ground spraying with Queletox (60 % a. 1. Fenthion) on roosts of the <b>Golden</b> and House <b>Sparrows</b> was conducted along hedge rows of acacia (Acacia mellifera) located at the north end of the farm. Although the spray killed large numbers of roosting birds, damage con- tinued as the wheat matured. Pilot field trials were thus organized to test the effectiveness of other crop protection techniques. Because birds fed throughout many blocks of wheat which matured at different periods, it was felt that several different experiments could be conducted without Interfering with each other. The control techniques Included an acoustical repellent, a chemical repellent, a chemical frightening agent, and a trap. The experiments, conducted from February 7 through February 23, 1975, were not designed as an integrated control operation...|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} {{granivorous}} birds {{are responsible for}} damage to cereal crops in Senegal. Palearctic migrants, such as ruffs (Philomachus pugnax), godwits (Limosa limosa), and waterfowl damage newly sown rice seed or germinating plants. The main pests to ripening cereals are the red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), black-headed weavers (Ploceus melanocephalus), village weavers (P. cucullatus), and <b>golden</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer luteus). Starlings (Lamprotornis chalybaeus), bishops (Euplectes spp.), parakeets (Psittacula kramerii), and doves (Streptopelia spp.), are often locally abundant pests. The communal roosting and nesting habits of only two of these approximately 10 species, quelea and <b>golden</b> <b>sparrows,</b> makes them susceptible to the mass destruction techniques almost universally employed by regional and national African bird control organizations. Such techniques may be applicable to large bird concentrations but usually are not economical for protecting small cereal schemes nor ecologically advisable when these bird concentrations install in marshes. Therefore, a main emphasis of the UNDP/FAO Quelea Project research has been to evaluate alternate methods of protecting cereal crops, one method {{of which is the}} use of chemical repellents. This paper summarizes the results of work conducted in Senegal between 1975 and 1977 in which the chemical methiocarb (3, 5 dimethyl- 4 -(methylthio) - phenol methylcarbamate; Mesurol), was applied as a seed dressing immediately prior to sowing and to the heads of maturing cereals. Some of the results reported herein have previously been published and are cited when appropriate in the text but are included for completeness. Methiocarb has been an effective, broad-spectrum, and non-lethal repellent to many bird pests in several countries (Guarino 1972; Crase and DeHaven 1976; Calvi et al. 1976. ...|$|R
