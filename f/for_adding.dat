5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often {{juxtaposed}} picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more sensitive playing and was known <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him {{play a key}} role in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{second term}} also saw his first speeches in Congress on the country's {{financial}} situation, {{which had been}} harmed by the Panic of 1857. Citing the need to pare unnecessary expenditures in light of diminished revenue, Sherman especially criticized Southern senators <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> appropriations to the House's bills. His speech attracted attention and {{was the start of}} Sherman's focus on financial matters, which would continue throughout his long political career.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} construction cost did {{not include}} the R$38.1million required <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> temporary bleachers, which were removed after the World Cup was over. They were set on one of the sides and on the north and south ends. The addition of the bleachers would raise the stadium's capacity up to 72,000 seats, but would necessitate the relocation of VIP areas and television equipment reducing capacity. Corinthians paid for additional temporary infrastructure required exclusively for the World Cup, which was estimated to cost between R$60million and 100million.|$|E

5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that {{this could have been}} done without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E
5|$|From January 11, 1785, to {{the fall}} of 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall. Federal Hall was also the site of where the United States Supreme Court {{met for the first}} time, the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified, and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, {{establishing}} measures <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> new states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 2008, a {{bond issue}} {{for a new}} $95 million high school was passed. Groundbreaking for the new high school took place on September 23, 2009, and {{construction}} was completed on April 1, 2012 at $7 million under budget. As a result, the school board approved construction of a $975,000 ticket/concession/restroom and storage building. This also allowed the asphalt parking to be changed to concrete and <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> artificial turf to the football field, which saves on future maintenance costs. Installation of the football field's turf was completed in September 2011. In early 2012, the Board of Education approved a 1-1 initiative, providing every student with an iPad. In 2012, GCHS was selected as one of 314 Blue Ribbon Schools nationwide. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes {{public and private schools}} which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements. In addition, principal James Mireles was honored with the Terrel H. Bell Award for Outstanding Leadership.|$|E

5|$|Penn National wanted Rosecroft {{to begin}} {{simulcasting}} races in late August 2011. Disputes between tracks and simulcasters about revenues, however, {{led to a}} delay in reaching new agreements on broadcast rights. In the 2011, the Maryland legislature passed a bill that required all parties to enter into mediation. If mediation was not successful by October 1, 2011, then an arbitrator was required to help. To resolve a conflict of interest, Penn National sold its financial stake in the Maryland Jockey Club's in July 2011. In August 2011, Rosecroft made public its plans <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> a casino at Rosecroft. It planned to destroy the grandstand and build a casino with approximately 4,700 slot machines alongside the track.|$|E
5|$|In late 1977, the CPO {{made plans}} to push <b>for</b> <b>adding</b> SR117 to the Interstate Highway System, to obtain {{additional}} federal funding. By 1979, both San Diego city and county had allocated $6million to construct a temporary way to access the border crossing along Otay Mesa and Harvest Roads. Two years later, the City of San Diego indicated that the upgrade of Otay Mesa Road to a four-lane road would be the preferred option; the state agreed to allocate $2million towards the $10million project, with the city contributing $6.4million and the county adding $2.3million. The Federal Highway Administration approved the continuous roadway via SR117 and SR125 from I-5 to the border at Otay Mesa as a non-chargeable (not eligible for federal Interstate Highway construction dollars) part of the Interstate Highway System in October1984. The Otay Mesa border crossing opened on January 24, 1985. The route number was legislatively changed to 905 in 1986, and signs were updated in 1988. This change was to apply for other federal funding. The original piece of SR117, west of I-5, also became SR905 {{with the rest of}} SR117, but Caltrans has not constructed it.|$|E
