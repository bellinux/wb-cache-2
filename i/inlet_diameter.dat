To investigate whether the current 37 -mm inlet cap can be redesigned to better meet the IPM sampling criterion, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed, and particle sampling efficiencies associated with various modifications to the CFC inlet cap were determined.

40|$|Abstract — Vortices can be {{produced}} and ingested into the intake of a jet engine during high power operation {{in the vicinity of}} solid surfaces causing Foreign Object Damage (FOD) or compressor stall and engine surge problems. This can occur when the engine is mounted on the wing of a plane during take-off and engine ground runs or when the engine is placed inside a test cell for testing after an engine overhaul and prior to reinstallation onto the aircraft. In order to prevent such vortices from forming, especially in the test cells, it is necessary to be able to predict the onset of the vortex or understand the factors affecting the formation of such vortices. Ho and Jermy [TD 1 DT] investigated vortex formation using a suction tube in a open-end box model simulating an engine in a test cell scenario and found that 3 distinct regimes of flow (regular vortex, deformed vortex and no vortex) exists as the ratio of suction inlet velocity to upstream average velocity (Vi/Vo) varies. The effect of the upstream velocity gradient and suction <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> on the threshold is considered. The results show that the as the size of the suction <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> is increased, the range of conditions over which a vortex forms also increases. This is in line with earlier findings [TD 2 DT] in the take-off and engine run scenarios. The threshold for all three regimes appears to shift to a lower Vi/Vo for a given ratio of height over <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> (H/Di). This indicates that in order to accommodate a larger engine, it is necessary to increase the size of the test cell by more than the ratio of engine diameters if the same margin of safety (with respect to vortex formation) are to be maintained...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the Reynolds {{number at}} mean flow was <[*] 1760 and was >[*] 2000 at peak flow under intubation. Therefore, gas flow became {{turbulent}} at peak flow and then decelerated markedly to a laminar flow, regardless of tube size, because the lower critical Reynolds number is approximately 1760, below which turbulent structures cannot be sustained by any induced disturbance [25]. The pressure gradient of turbulent flow produces fluid flow less efficiently {{than that of}} laminar flow [26 – 28], which may have affected WOB and pressure parameters. The upper critical value of the Reynolds number for transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow cannot be generalized even when at 2000 in clinical practice. Hof et al. [28] reported that “Most pipe flows are turbulent in practice even at modest flow rates”. The <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> of ASL 5000 ™ was sufficiently large, such that inspiratory flow constantly remained laminar {{with an increase in}} respiratory rate because the Reynolds number was constantly <[*] 1760.

An experimental design was out, which consists of the creation of a structure that allowed precise displacements of the probe. Different configurations were made in which different volumes, <b>inlet</b> <b>diameters</b> and heights of water were used. Data acquisition consisted in the measurements in a series of points of the tank. From the program of the probe, called HorizonADV, the data acquisition was made later data were filtered by an specific program called WinADV. Calculations were made using a spreadsheet to find the resist tank coefficient. The comparison of the obtained results has indicated that there are in the different points a the tank. With these velocities, has been found the integrated velocity of the tank and its respective resist tank coefficient. Tank coefficients, were very similar. This gives to understand, that resist tank coefficient was stable and that it can be very useful in order to obtain the desired velocities self-cleaning, within a safe range for fish of velocities...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the swirling flame flow field and gasification/ combustion dynamics at thermo-chemical conversion of biomass pellets has experimentally been studied using a pilot device, which combines a biomass gasifier and combustor by varying the inlet conditions of the fuel-air mixture into the combustor. Experimental modelling {{of the formation of}} the cold nonreacting swirling airflow field above the inlet nozzle of the combustor and the upstream flow formation below the inlet nozzle has been carried out to assess the influence of the <b>inlet</b> nozzle <b>diameter,</b> as well primary and secondary air supply rates on the upstream flow formation and air swirl intensity, which is highly responsible for the formation of fuel-air mixture entering the combustor and the {{development of}} combustion dynamics downstream of the combustor. The research results demonstrate that at equal primary axial and secondary swirling air supply into the device a decrease in the <b>inlet</b> nozzle <b>diameter</b> enhances the upstream air swirl formation by increasing swirl intensity below the inlet nozzle of the combustor. This leads to the enhanced mixing of the combustible volatiles with the air swirl below the inlet nozzle of the combustor providing a more complete combustion of volatiles and an increase in the heat output of the device...|$|R
