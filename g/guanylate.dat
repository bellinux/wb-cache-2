5|$|Tbr1 forms {{a complex}} with CASK and regulates gene {{expression}} in cortical development. Tbr1 binds to the <b>guanylate</b> kinase (GK) domain of CASK. It {{was determined that}} the C-terminal domain of Tbr1 in crucial and solely capable of this process. Through luciferase reporter assays of neurons in the hippocampus, {{it was found that}} increased Tbr1/CASK complex expression results in enhanced promoter activity in genes downstream of TBR1 such as NMDAR subunit 2b (NMDAR2b), glycine transporter, interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and OX-2 genes. NMDAR2b experienced the greatest change in activity.|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide is a {{compound}} produced by many {{cells of the}} body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic <b>guanylate</b> cyclase, activating <b>guanylate</b> cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body.|$|E
25|$|Connector {{enhancer}} of kinase suppressor of ras 2, {{also known}} as CNK homolog protein 2 (CNK2) or maguin (membrane-associated <b>guanylate</b> kinase-interacting protein), is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CNKSR2 gene.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a theory}} that, in some nerve cell synapses, when {{long-term}} memories are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells {{have been shown to}} contain <b>guanylate</b> cyclase, an enzyme that is activated by carbon monoxide.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase, activation of the soluble <b>guanylate</b> cyclase, ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation, and iron regulatory factor activation. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that NO acts through the {{stimulation}} of the soluble <b>guanylate</b> cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates protein kinase G, which causes reuptake of Ca2+ {{and the opening of}} calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca2+ ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.|$|E
25|$|The interactome {{of class}} III β-tubulin {{comprises}} the GTPase GBP1 (<b>guanylate</b> binding protein 1) and {{a panel of}} an additional 19 kinases having prosurvival activity including PIM1 (Proviral Integration Site 1) and NEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6). Incorporation of these kinases into the cytoskeleton via the GBP-1/ class III β-tubulin interaction protects kinases from rapid degradation. Other pro-survival factors interacting with class III β-tubulin enabling cellular adaptation to oxidative stress include the molecular chaperone HSP70/GRP75. FMO4 (vimentin/dimethylalanine monooxygenase 4) and GSTM4 (glutathione transferase M4).|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil protects cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to <b>guanylate</b> cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|E6 {{can also}} bind to PDZ-domains, short {{sequences}} {{which are often}} found in signaling proteins. E6's structural motif allows for interaction with PDZ domains on DLG (discs large) and hDLG (Drosophila large) tumor suppressor genes. Binding at these locations causes transformation of the DLG protein and disruption of its suppressor function. E6 proteins also interact with the MAGUK (membrane-associated <b>guanylate</b> kinase family) proteins. These proteins, including MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3 are usually structural proteins, and can help with signaling. More significantly, they {{are believed to be}} involved with DLG's suppression activity. When E6 complexes with the PDZ domains on the MAGI proteins, it distorts their shape and thereby impedes their function. Overall, the E6 protein serves to impede normal protein activity {{in such a way as}} to allow a cell to grow and multiply at the increased rate characteristic of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{erythrocyte}} it {{interacts with}} band 4.1 (an 80-kDa protein) and p55 (a palmitoylated peripheral membrane phosphoprotein {{and a member}} of the membrane-associated <b>guanylate</b> kinase family) to form a ternary complex that is critical for the shape and stability of erythrocytes. The major attachment sites between the erythrocyte spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer are glycophorin C and band 3. The interaction with band 4.1 and p55 is mediated by the N terminal 30 kD domain of band 4.1 binding to a 16 amino acid segment (residues 82-98: residues 61-77 of glycophorin D) within the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C and to a positively charged 39 amino acid motif in p55. The majority of protein 4.1 is bound to glycophorin C. The magnitude of the strength of the interaction between glycophorin C and band 4.1 has been estimated to be 6.9 microNewtons per meter, a figure typical of proteinprotein interactions.|$|E
2500|$|... eNOS has a {{protective}} {{function in the}} cardiovascular system, which is attributed to NO production. Regulation of the vascular tone {{is one of the}} best known roles of NO in the cardiovascular system. Once produced in endothelial cells, NO diffuses across the vascular smooth muscle cell membranes and activates the enzyme soluble <b>guanylate</b> cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which promotes multiple phosphorylation of cellular targets lowering cellular Ca2+ concentrations and promoting vascular relaxation.|$|E
2500|$|MSG is one {{of several}} forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is {{pervasive}} in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term [...] "spices and flavorings". The ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate and disodium <b>guanylate</b> are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term [...] "natural flavor" [...] is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion).

2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} occurs due {{to chronic}} inflammation. [...] The principal {{cause of the}} chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). [...] In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to {{the cells of the}} lower esophagus. Recently, bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [...] and the protein kinase enzyme Akt. This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex NF-κB (NFKB1), and ultimately activation of the homeobox gene CDX2, which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as <b>guanylate</b> cyclase 2C. This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.|$|E
