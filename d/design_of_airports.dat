40|$|International audienceThis {{article focuses}} {{on the process of}} the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> and how in {{particular}} the urban context has shaped their specific histories. Far from being merely pure technical or functional equipment, they have been mirrors for contemporary expectations, just as they informed the modern urban imaginary. According to this perspective, an urban history of airports can be traced from the first aerodromes dedicated to large urban publics to the development of spectacular airports driven by the massive recent routinization of air transport so intricately bound up with globalization. Based on research on specific cases of the design and building of New York and Paris airports, this article aims to resist the temptations to dehistoricize the airport topic, and to introduce a narrative mode of thinking about these specific and concrete spaces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} reach an optimum {{analysis}} and design for airport aprons variables such as the area and dimensions of the apron considering the passenger and cargo, the number and dimensions of the gates depending on the different type of aircraft, parking configuration and the arrangement of aircraft in different time periods at the airport has been looked into carefully. In this research a mathematical model for the optimum analysis and <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> aprons based on minimum transportation cost has been developed. The main parameters considered for transportation cost are user capital and operational costs. Based on these parameters, a mathematical model as well as computerized simulation software have been developed taking into consideration the actual variables <b>of</b> <b>design</b> and analysis <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> aprons. The results obtained from the computerized simulation software indicate that the policies <b>of</b> the <b>airport</b> authorities and air carriers {{within the context of}} flight scheduling, gate use strategy, planning and analyzing the operational condition of the aircraft fleet {{have a significant impact on}} the planning and <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> aprons...|$|R
40|$|Part VI: Services, Supply Chains and OperationsInternational audienceOur {{purpose of}} this study is {{evaluating}} preferences for air travel services connected between the east and west central cities in Japan, Tokyo and Osaka, to consider the appropriate re-allocation <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> in Japan. We employ a choice experiment and recruit more than 500 respondents in east and west areas in Japan and investigate their preferences. Our results are as follows. The existing airline connected west hub airport, Itami, in Osaka and east hub airport, Haneda, in Tokyo is much preferred to the other lines connected cities surrounding Osaka and Tokyo. Kobe and Kansai international airports are preferable to Itami airport, while Haneda is the much preferable to Ibaraki and Narita international airports. Increasing the mileage program and the availability of web check-in have positive significant effects but these impacts are small. These results imply that the most important factor for using air travel services is convenience for traveling by using the nearest airports. In this meaning, if the new airlines can be connected to Haneda, the government’s re-allocation plan from Itami airport to Kobe and Kansai international airports has a chance to succeed to minimize the economic efficiency loss for the people traveling between east and west areas in Japan...|$|E
40|$|Today, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> - {{and their}} success - is {{conventionally}} measured by its efficiency; by {{its ability to}} manage the arrival and departure of planes on time for the minimum of passenger effort. Airports such as London Heathrow - the “gateway” into the UK - has seen extensive renovation over its years to facilitate the growing demand of air travel, where the passenger spends {{most of the time}} battling the queues. The focus of this research project is the design of an airport terminal which invokes “gateway”, as a way of reflecting a nation’s unique identity. The selected context for this project is Fiji Islands, a holiday destination sought by many across the globe for its unique culture, climate and tourism attractions. The project begins by investigating the historical context of travel, highlighting interesting facts, discoveries and achievements made through the evolution of transport, such as the emergence of the Stagecoach era in the 18 th century, to the first international flight from London to Paris in 1919. The focus is then shifted towards the architecture of early airport terminals precedents, from the expressionism of Eero Saarinen’s TWA Terminal in 1962, to the celebration of regional characteristics in Norman Foster’s Beijing Airport, begun 2003. The study of precedents are of particular significance to the topic of this research, ultimately informing strategies for design. The intention is to prepare, or perhaps re-configure, the normal processes of an airport terminal as a series of experiences which reflect and instigate the imagery and presence of Fiji...|$|E
40|$|Stockholms first land airport opened 1936 in Bromma, to day {{a suburb}} 7 km west of Stockholm City Center. The final {{organization}} {{and design of}} the airport buildings {{was the result of}} an invited architectural competition. The airport is still operating and in 2012 it was Sweden's fourth airport in number of passengers. The air station building of 1936 and the first hangar are still in use as airport buildings and were declared national historic buildings in 2000. In connection with a study 1 on the planning- and construction process of the Stockholm-Bromma Airport, which included the aforementioned architectural competition, a number of issues have arissen. 9 ̆ 5 Did there exist any internationally accepted recommendations or models for the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> and their buildings, that would have been possible and suitable to use for the programming and planning of the Bromma Airport? 9 ̆ 5 Did the solutions presented in the Bromma competition represent best practice or did they represent a new, inovative way of designing a civil airport for the future? 9 ̆ 5 Were architectural competitions appropriate methods to obtain the best solutions for the still uncertain future of aviation and airports? To deepen the understanding of what was the the background and role models for the solutions chosen for Bromma Airport, this paper describes different activities in Northern Europe and in the USA 1920 - 1940, to improve the state of knowledge in terms of airport design. Two talked about idea competitions for airports and some ordinary architectural competitions in Europe are reviewed. The paper also gives a detailed review of the Bromma Airport competition and concludes with a discussion about architectural competitions as a tool to develop expertise in airport planning...|$|E

A new set of level-of-service (LOS) standards for orientation has been proposed based on the visibility indices of the terminal facilities.

50|$|Robert Sommer {{studied the}} <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> seating and {{concluded}} that the arrangement of chairs in rigid lines bolted to the floor was deliberately sociofugal — discouraging social interaction such as conversation and encouraging the sitters to go to commercial locations such as shops and cafes. The provision of arms on the chairs increased the usage of the chairs, as compared with bench seats without arms. Strangers are more comfortable sitting adjacent each other if there is an arm to mark their personal space. The parallel orientation of the modular seat units also minimises face-to-face contact and this is less threatening for strangers.|$|R

In addition, the stress relaxation was considered in the drying shrinkage.
