Satisfactory silage was prepared from corn plants, taro leaves, taro stems, unused leaves of cabbage, the rind of egg plants, green pods of pea, <b>hairy</b> <b>vetches,</b> chickweeds, stems and leaves of horse bean, mugworts, stems and leaves of radish, and sweet potato vines. These silages have generally been found to be favourite feeds with livestocks. Digestion experiments of the silage of unused leaves of cabbage on guinea pigs have resulted in satisfactory coefficients of digestibility. When the material containing a large quantity of moisture is used, close attention should be paid to the preparation of silage.

40|$|To measure UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: beta-galactose beta 1, 4 -N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (beta 1, 4 -GalNActransferase) in crude {{cell and}} tissue {{extracts}} we designed an assay containing UDP-[3 H]N-acetylgalactosamine as donor and biotinylated human glycophorin A as an acceptor. After incubation the labelled acceptor was separated {{by the use}} of avidin-agarose from extract-derived endogenous acceptors. This assay permitted one to measure specifically the beta 1, 4 -GalNActransferase in crude extracts. This glycosyltransferase has previously been shown {{to be involved in the}} biosynthesis of Vicia villosa (<b>hairy</b> winter <b>vetch)</b> -lectin (VV) -binding sites of the murine cytotoxic T-cell line B 6. 1. Since VV-binding sites are a distinct marker for the cytotoxic subclass of murine T-lymphocytes, we used this assay to determine enzyme levels in a panel of functionally defined murine T-cell clones. Non-cytolytic T-cell lines generally have low activity, whereas most cytotoxic lines have high levels of activity. However, one cytotoxic T-cell line does not express the enzyme, although it has large numbers of VV-binding sites. This suggests the existence of another type of VV-binding sites which is independent of the beta 1, 4 -GalNActransferase in some cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte lines. The enzyme was also assayed in a variety of other tissues and found to have a very high activity in the intestine but a low activity in most other tissues. This was in considerable contrast with the ubiquitously high expression of UDP-GalNAc:peptide alpha 1 -GalNActransferase. Therefore, the beta 1, 4 -GalNActransferase seems to be regulated during differentiation...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{different}} organic and chemical fertilizers on weed biomass and some characteristics of safflower, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replications was done at the Urmia University Reaearch Farm in 2013. Treatments consisted of growing of cover crops (red clover, grass pea, <b>hairy,</b> bitter <b>vetch)</b> along with the safflower rows and two weed control treatments (with and without weed) as a first factor and application of organic manure (cattle manure+biofertilizer) and the different nitrogen and phosphuros fertilizer levels (100 % of recommended chemical fertilizer, 67 and 63 % of recommended N and P, 50 and 40 % of recommended N and P) as second factor. Results showed that the biomass yield of broad and narrow leaf weeds affected by the combined treatments of cover crops and use of fertilizers. The biomass yield of broad and narrow leaf weeds were redused by 74. 78, 82. 22 % under vetch cover crop when 50 and 40 % of recommended N and P fertilizers were used, in comparison with sole culture of safflower and use of 100 % of recommended chemical fertilizers. The maximum of seed yield (3431 kg. ha- 1) and biological yield (8239 kg. ha- 1) of safflower obtained from using 100 % of recommended chemical fertilizers and without growing cover crops.

40|$|Corn stalk rot – CSR is {{a complex}} disease caused by many organisms, among fungi and bacteria, due to {{interactions}} between soil- or residue-borne organisms and environmental stresses acting on the plant. Studies have been done to understand this complex {{to find ways to}} minimize losses due to the disease. The main objective of this work was to assess CSR incidence after different winter crop rotations under conventional and no tillage conditions. A winter crop rotation experiment under no till and conventional tillage has been carried out at Pato Branco Iapar Exp. Sta. since 1986, and corn hybrid DKB 240 PRO was planted in all plots at Spring. There were 10 winter alternatives and fallow and clean fallow, totaling 12 treatments, planted in conventional and no tillage stripes, with randomized rotations within the stripes, and 3 reps. Plots were 20 m long by 6 m for each planting system. Only half of plots had N dressing. CSR was assessed in 20 random plants per rotation, planting system and N dressing, using finger pressure at the third internode above soil level. Separate statistical analyses were done using SAS procedures for CSR incidence with and without N dressing. There was no CSR incidence difference within cropping systems. Rotation including leguminous crops (lupine, <b>hairy,</b> or common <b>vetch)</b> decreased CSR incidence, whereas those with grass crops (wheat, rye, ryegrass, or oats) favored the disease.

50|$|Organic gardeners often plant <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a {{companion}} plant to tomatoes, {{as an alternative}} to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> {{is widely}} used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of {{atmospheric}} nitrogen. [...] Disadvantages of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> in production agriculture {{are related to the}} crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season - leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production.|$|E
50|$|Vicia villosa, {{known as}} the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch,</b> fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure.|$|E
50|$|Various {{legume crops}} benefit from being commingled with a grassy nurse crop. For example, common vetch or <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> is planted {{together}} with rye or winter wheat {{to make a}} good cover crop or green manure (or both).|$|E
50|$|The bitter vetch, too, {{is grown}} {{extensively}} for forage and fodder, as are <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> (V. villosa, also called fodder vetch), bard vetch (V. articulata), French vetch (V. serratifolia) and Narbon bean (V. narbonensis). V. benghalensis and Hungarian vetch (V. pannonica) are cultivated for forage and green manure.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} fast-growing and flowers prolifically, sending out 10 to 40 flowered one-sided racemes {{cascading}} pea-flower shaped purple to violet flowers from the leaf axil during its late spring to late summer flowering period. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees; when the flowers drop off and tiny bright green seed pods 10-20 mm long, start to form. Cow vetch {{is very similar}} to <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa), but is distinguished from the latter by its smooth stem.|$|E
50|$|The vetches {{grown as}} forage are {{generally}} toxic to non-ruminants (such as humans), {{at least if}} eaten in quantity. Cattle and horses have been poisoned by V. villosa and V. benghalensis, two species that contain canavanine in their seeds. Canavanine, a toxic analogue of the amino acid arginine, has been identified in <b>Hairy</b> <b>Vetch</b> as an appetite suppressant for monogastric animals, while Narbon bean contains the quicker-acting but weaker γ-glutamyl-S-ethenylcysteine. In common vetch, γ-glutamyl-β-cyanoalanine has been found. The active part of this molecule is β-cyanoalanine. It inhibits {{the conversion of the}} sulfur amino acid methionine to cysteine.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to competition-based or physical weed suppression, certain cover crops {{are known to}} suppress weeds through allelopathy (Creamer et al. 1996, Singh et al. 2003). This occurs when certain biochemical cover crop compounds are degraded that happen to be toxic to, or inhibit seed germination of, other plant species. Some well known examples of allelopathic cover crops are Secale cereale (rye), Vicia villosa (<b>hairy</b> <b>vetch),</b> Trifolium pratense (red clover), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum-sudangrass), and species in the Brassicaceae family, particularly mustards (Haramoto and Gallandt 2004). In one study, rye cover crop residues {{were found to have}} provided between 80% and 95% control of early season broadleaf weeds when used as a mulch during the production of different cash crops such as soybean, tobacco, corn, and sunflower (Nagabhushana et al. 2001).|$|E
50|$|The vetches {{also have}} a broad variety of other purposes. The <b>Hairy</b> <b>Vetch</b> has {{well-established}} uses as a green manure and as an allelopathic cover crop. As regards the broad bean, it is known to accumulate aluminum in its tissue; in polluted soils {{it may be useful}} in phytoremediation, but with one permil of aluminum in the dry plant (possibly more in the seeds), it might not be edible anymore. The robust plants are useful as a beetle bank to provide habitat and shelter for carnivorous beetles and other arthropods to keep down pest invertebrates. When the root nodules of broad bean are inoculated with the rhodospirillacean bacterium Azospirillum brasilense and the glomeracean fungus Glomus clarum, the species can also be productively grown in salty soils. In the 1980s, the auxin 4-Cl-IAA was studied in V. amurensis and the broad bean, and since 1990, the antibacterial γ-thionins fabatin-1 and -2 have been isolated from the latter species.|$|E
50|$|Ascochyta blight of pea {{is caused}} by Ascomycete fugi. This fungus has an {{anamorphic}} (asexual) stage and a telemorphic (sexual) stage. Ascochyta fungal pathogens are heterothallic, meaning they require two compatible hyphae strains to form their sexual stage. Pycnidia of Ascochyta spp. can overwinter in soil, seeds, or infected plant debris. They release pycnidiospores that {{come into contact with}} host tissue and germinate- as the primary inoculum- penetrating through stomatal openings in the Spring. Lesions soon become visible on the leaves. Next, the fungal hyphae grows and produces pear-shaped pycnidia, eventually releasing pycnidiospores that can reinfect plants or seeds via rain splashes- these are considered the secondary inoculum. Compatible hyphae may also fuse to form dikaryotic mycelium, that produce asci-bearing pseudothecia. These can also overwinter in infected plant debris and release their ascospores in the spring to infect new hosts as primary inoculum via wind. The presence of two mating types contributes to genetic variation via recombination. This has helped the pathogen to create outbreaks in previously resistant varieties of plants. Usually, Ascochyta species are host specific: A. fabae, A. lentis, A. pisi, and A. viciae-villosae infect the faba bean, lentil, pea, and <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> respectively. That is, each species only causes symptoms on their respective hosts and not on another. The pea died.|$|E

This two-year field experiment was conducted on a sandy Acrisol (FAO soil classification) or Argissolo Vermelho distrófico arênico (Brazilian Soil Classification), at a mean annual temperature of 18 ºC and mean annual rainfall of 1686 mm. The experiment was arranged in a double split-plot factorial design with three replications. Two levels of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> residue (50 and 100 % of the aboveground biomass production) were distributed {{on the surface of}} the main plots (5 x 12 m). Maize in the sub-plots (5 x 4 m) was fertilized with three N rates (0, 60, and 120 kg ha- 1 N), with urea as N source. The hairy vetch-derived N recovered by maize was evaluated in microplots (1. 8 x 2. 2 m). The BFN of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> was on average 72. 4 %, which represents an annual input of 130 kg ha- 1 of atmospheric N.

The nitrate nitrogen concentration in irrigated water ranged between 0. 17 and 0. 37 ppm and did not show much difference among the treatments until the end of June, but the maximum difference detected was in the duck-rice plot in July, 0. 11 ppm, compared to the hairy plot and duck-rice + <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> plot, 0. 08 ppm and 0. 09 ppm respectively. But the concentration of ammonium nitrogen at the end of July reached 4. 07 ppm in the plot of duck-rice, but it was 2. 83 ppm in the plot of duck-rice + <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> and 2. 12 ppm in the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> plot respectively. The bio-mass of weed showed the lowest in the plot of duck rice + <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> and highest in <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> plot among the treatments. The plot of duck-rice shows the water contamination in terms of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen in the irrigation outlet and strong odor of duck dung even in the neighboring or surrounding field were detected due to high number of ducks introduced in the duck-rice system, 300 ducklings/ha.

In our study, we investigated the bottom-up effects of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> seeding methods (i. e., control of seeding timing and density) on the B. anurus density to develop a field production method for B. anurus. The average densities of H. postica and B. anurus were significantly higher with early timing and a higher seeding density compared with early timing and a lower seeding density, late timing and a higher seeding density and late timing, and a lower seeding density. This confirmed that the densities of H. postica and B. anurus could be adjusted by the bottom-up effect of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> seeding methods. During the tri-trophic interaction among <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch,</b> H. postica, and B. anurus, {{the interaction between the}} <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> weight and H. postica densities was high, whereas the interaction between the H. postica and B. anurus densities was very high.

40|$|Legume <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> and non-legume barley {{mixtures}} are broadly cultivated {{to improve}} the value of cover crops in mono-rice paddies. Nevertheless, the effects of mixing conditions of the two cover crops on biomass and nutrient productivities and on the yield characteristics of subsequent rice crops have not been well studied. To evaluate the effects of mix-seeding legume and non-legume cover crops {{on the value of}} green manure in paddy soil, barley and <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> were sown at the rice harvesting stage as pure crops at the recommended rates (180 kg ha− 1 of barley, B 100; 90 kg ha− 1 of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch,</b> V 100), and as mixtures, in which the two cover crops were mix-seeded with varying seed ratios according to the replacement principle. The mixed seeding of the two crops significantly increased the cover crop biomass and nutrient productivities compared with the single barley and <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> cultivation. Biomass productivity linearly increased with increasing barley seeding level, but it was not affected by the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> seeding rate. The total N content of the barley biomass clearly increased as the proportion of the total biomass accounted for by <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> was increased, and this significantly improved the value of the green manure of cover crop biomass. In contrast, the total N content of the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> biomass was not affected by changes in the barley proportion. Biomass produced in the pure barley seeding could not produce the nutrients required by the recommended chemical fertilization level (N–P 2 O 5 –K 2 O = 90 – 45 – 57 kg ha− 1) for rice, but the biomass increase caused by mixed seeding of the two cover crops resulted in enough nutrients to satisfy the recommended fertilization level. The highest biomass and nutrient yields were observed for the mixed seeding of barley and <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> at 25 and 75 % (B 75 V 25) of their respective recommended seeding rates. This increased nutrient input stimulated the rice plant growth and significantly improved the rice yields. The highest yields were achieved with the B 75 V 25 treatment. In conclusion, mixed seeding of legume <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> and non-legume barley could be a very useful agronomic practice for increasing the cover crop biomass and its nutrient productivity and {{to improve the}} productivity of subsequent rice crops in temperate rice paddies...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{nitrogen}} (N) supply from <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> grown as winter green manure on white cabbage was investigated in field trials performed on an organic farm in north-west Germany over two years. <b>Hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> was either used as green manure or harvested. One of two bare-soil fallow treatments was supplied with <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> shoot mass to serve as reference. In 2002 and 2003, <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> and weeds accumulated 136 and 178 kg ha- 1 of shoot N and yielded 3. 79 and 4. 72 t ha- 1, respectively. After ploughing and planting white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata var. capitata f. alba) for sauerkraut production {{at the beginning of}} June, the amount of soil mineral N (SMN) of the topsoil layer was biweekly investigated until canopy for about 6 - 8 weeks. In 2002, already within 2 weeks a maximum of 121 kg SMN ha- 1 for the green manure <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> treatment was reached, whereas in 2003 a maximum of only 60 kg SMN ha- 1 was observed due to an exceptionally dry and warm season. In 2002, white cabbage shoot yielded an average 4. 4 t DM ha- 1 (range 3. 9 - 5. 1 t ha- 1 DM) and had accumulated on average 153 kg N ha- 1 (range 129 - 178 kg N ha- 1). Mean fresh matter yield (FM) of a single head was only 1. 2 kg (range 1. 1 - 1. 3 kg head- 1) due to severe pest damage. In the following year, the mean head yield was 5. 1 kg FM (range 3. 4 - 6. 4 kg) and head yield per hectare was 5. 8 t DM (range 4. 6 - 7. 5 t DM ha- 1) with a mean head N uptake of 182 kg ha- 1 (range 136 - 237 kg N ha- 1). The relationship between the weighted arithmetic daily mean of SMN for the first 6 - 8 weeks after the <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> harvest date and the N uptake of cabbage at two sampling dates was significant, as were most correlations between presented core parameters. Although N of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> used as green manure calculatively recovered on average only about 27...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa Roth.) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as {{a good candidate for}} weed suppressive mulch in organic no-till cropping systems. In our study, the allelopathic potential of <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch,</b> fall rye (Secale cereale L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (extracted species) were eva-luated at both vegetative and reproductive developmental stages (extract stage) based on the germination and radicle elongation of five response species using aqueous extracts in soil micro-cosms. Our study found <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> shoot extract to have little allelopathic potential compared to fall rye or winter wheat, both species for which the allelopathic potential is well documented. In-terestingly, <b>hairy</b> <b>vetch</b> was the only extracted species to increase in allelopathic suppression of radicle elongation at the reproductive stage when plant biomass is near maximum. This result was conceivably due to the increased concentration of the putative allelochemical cyanamide in re-productive tissue. Chemical inhibition of radicle elongation in this extract, however, was only ob-served in the domesticated response species wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.). The allelopathic effect on germination varied and depended on extracted species, ex-tract stage, and response species; whereas the effect on radicle elongation was similar among ex...|$|E
