5000|$|Bounded by {{impoundment}}s (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use [...] "local materials" [...] {{including the}} tailings themselves, {{and may be}} considered embankment dams. Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was {{to deal with a}} tailings slurry. This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge. The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. <b>dry</b> <b>stacking,</b> see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances. Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.Tailing ponds are areas of refused mining tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a pond to allow the sedimentation (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams. It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world. The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as bentonite to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.|$|E

To encourage further debate, the paper develops a set of sustainable development principles for the disposal of mining and mineral processing wastes, and discusses the implications for current and future practise. In practise, the principles can guide waste disposal decisions through the consideration of what risk and magnitude, in any given local context, a particular management solution poses to their application. The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses. Future trends in mining and processing may compound the challenges of waste management, as lower ore grades increase the ratio of waste produced for a given unit of resource, and emphasise the urgency and need for the industry to adopt new approaches.

40|$|Alcoa World Alumina Australia is the world’s leading {{producer}} of aluminium and alumina, with three alumina refineries in Western Australia and a further six refineries located in Europe, the Caribbean, North and South America. During the refining process, an alkaline residue is produced and is deposited in lined storage areas {{designed to protect}} ground and surface waters. As early as 1977, Alcoa recognised the need to investigate alternative residue management strategies. The company made a significant commitment to continuous improvement in tailings management through {{the establishment of a}} focussed research and development group charged with the responsibility of “establishing Alcoa’s reputation as a leading company in the management of bauxite tailings”. Through ongoing research and field trials, a range of significant improvements to residue storage methods have been developed and implemented. Recent work has focussed on investigating ways to modify the residue, in particular decreasing its alkalinity to further lessen its potential environmental impact. Residue carbonation has been developed and tested at the Kwinana refinery and is currently being expanded to a full scale operation. It is a process which is easily integrated with the current thickening and <b>dry</b> <b>stacking</b> process, offering a range of operational and environmental benefits. The potential to progressively implement the process at Alcoa’s other refineries worldwide is currently being evaluated. It is anticipated that residue carbonation will become the alumina industry’s best practice benchmark for residue treatment and storage worldwide. Alcoa has also been focussed on potential re-use opportunities for the residue. A number of potential uses have been progressed through to pilot and demonstration phase, opening the way for the re-use of considerable volumes of residue.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the response of}} a full-scale dry-stack masonry structure subject to earthquake loads. The following earthquakes were applied {{to the base of}} the structure: (a) North Ridge, (b) Llolleo, (c) El Centro and (d) Llolleo for the second time. The earthquake displacement signals had to be filtered by removing the slow-varying frequency components so that the available servo-hydraulic test machine could be used. The filtering produced acceptably low error when comparing the applied histories with the real earthquake histories. A 4 x 4 m structure was constructed on a 1 o of freedom shake table out of mortarless interlocking bricks with minimum reinforcement. A 2 560 kg mass was superimposed on the structure to model the roof. The test structure was instrumented with accelerometers and LVDTs. The results showed that the simulated Llolleo earthquakes caused the most damage. This damage was minor: several bricks cracked, other bricks shifted, vertical gaps opened up between the bricks, and the skim plaster spalled in several places. The Llolleo earthquake damage was estimated to be Grade 2 on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS). During the earthquake simulations the walls deflected up to 42 mm. However, the maximum permanent deformation recorded due to bricks shifting was only 4, 6 mm - a small fraction of the wall thickness. Although the peak ground acceleration (PGA) was 0, 7 g, the maximum acceleration experienced by the structure at a door opening was 3, 4 g. The tests were concluded by applying two harmonic base excitations. The first 5 Hz harmonic test, which corresponded to the undamaged structure's resonant frequency, produced less damage than the Llolleo earthquake. The second 15 s, 3 Hz sinusoidal base motion, which corresponded to the damaged structure's resonant frequency, caused major damage (EMS Grade 4). Despite major cracks in two walls forming the characteristic "X" failure, the structure continued to support the roof mass. Video analysis clearly demonstrated that <b>dry</b> <b>stacking</b> can result in large brick movements when the base is excited. The ability of the test structure to withstand the applied earthquakes and base harmonic motions is attributed to energy absorption and dissipation due to inter-brick friction and bricks cracking and crushing...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the addition of organic wastes (biosolids and poultry manure), in the presence or absence of added residue mud, would affect the properties of the residue sand and its suitability for revegetation. Materials and methods: Samples of freshly deposited residue sand were collected from Alcoa's Kwinana refinery. Samples were treated with phosphogypsum (2 % v/v), incubated, and leached. A laboratory experiment was then set up in which the two organic wastes were applied at 0 or the equivalent to 60 tones ha(- 1) in combination with residue mud added at rates of 0 %, 10 % and 20 % v/v. Samples were incubated for 8 weeks, after which, key chemical, physical and microbial properties of the residue sand were measured along with seed germination. Results and discussion: Additions of residue mud increased exchangeable Na(+), ESP and the pH, and HCO (3) (-) and Na(+) concentrations in saturation paste extracts. Additions of biosolids and poultry manure increased concentrations of extractable P, NH (4) (+), K, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe. Addition of residue mud, in combination with organic wastes, caused a marked decrease in macroporosity and a concomitant increase in mesoporosity, available water holding capacity and the quantity of water held at field capacity. With increasing residue mud additions, the percentage of sample present as sand particles (2 mm diameter) increased; greatest aggregation occurred where a combination of residue mud and poultry manure were added. Stability of aggregates, as measured by wet sieving, was greatest where poultry manure was applied. Although total organic C and soluble organic C were greater in biosolids than poultry manure treatments, the reverse was the case for microbial biomass C and basal respiration. In the biosolids and poultry manure treatments, increasing residue mud additions tended to increase soluble C, microbial biomass C and basal respiration. Germination index of watercress was highest in control samples and reduced by additions of biosolids and poultry manure which was attributed to the high EC and possibly high extractable P and NH (4) (+). Conclusions: The concurrent addition of residue mud and organic wastes can improve chemical, microbial and particularly physical properties of residue sand. Future research should include neutralisation of the mud (e. g. with gypsum) and subsequent leaching to remove salts originating from both the mud and organic wastes...|$|E

40|$|Student Number : 0100677 A - PhD thesis - School of Civil and Environmental Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThis thesis {{presents}} the findings on empirical study of dry-stack masonry. Dry-stack masonry {{refers to a}} method of building masonry walls, {{where most of the}} masonry units are laid without mortar in the joints. Of late (since mid eighties) in modern construction, dry-stacking or mortarless technology is increasingly becoming popular because of its advantages. The construction industry is acknowledging the need to accelerate the masonry construction process, as the traditional method is labour intensive and hence slower due to the presence {{of a large number of}} mortar joints. Early attempts were made to increase the size of masonry units (block instead of brick), thereby reducing the number of mortar joints, wherein the use of bedding mortar imposed constraints on the number of courses to be constructed in a day. Elimination of bedding mortar accelerates construction; thereby reducing cost, variation due to workmanship and generally small pool of skilled labour is required in <b>dry</b> <b>stacking.</b> Dry-stack masonry is a relatively new technology not yet regulated in the code of practice and therefore very limited information on the structural behaviour of the masonry is available. This project is based on the investigation of the HYDRAFORM dry-stack system, which utilises compressed soil-cement interlocking, blocks. The system is now widely used in Africa, Asia and South America. The main objective of the project was to establish through physical testing the capacity of the system to resist lateral load (e. g. wind load), vertical load and dynamic load such as earthquake loading. In the first phase of the project investigations were conducted under static loading where series of full-scale wall panels were constructed in the laboratory and tested under lateral loading, and others were tested under vertical loading to establish the mode of failure and load capacity of the system. Series of control tests were also conducted by testing series of wallettes to establish failure mechanism of the units and to establish the flexural strength of the system. Finally the test results were used for modelling, where load prediction models for the system under vertical loading and under lateral loading were developed. The theoretical load prediction models were tested against the test results and show good agreement. After the load capacity was established the next step in the study was to further improve the system for increased capacity particularly under dynamic loading. The normal Hydraform system was modified by introducing a conduit, which allows introduction of reinforcements. Series of dry-stack seismic systems were constructed and initially tested under static lateral loading to establish the lateral load capacity. The second Phase of the project was to investigate the structural behaviour and performance of the Hydraform system under seismic loading. A shaking table of 20 tonnes payload, (4 m x 4 m) in plan was designed and fabricated. A full-scale plain dry-stack masonry house was constructed on the shaking table and subjected to seismic base motions. The shaking table test was performed using sine wave signals excitations starting from low to very severe intensity. A conventional masonry test structure of similar parameters was also constructed on the table and tested in a similar manner for comparison. The tests were conducted using a frequency range of 1 Hz to 12 Hz and the specimens were monitored for peak accelerations and displacements. For both specimens the initial base motion was 0. 05 g. The study established the mode of failure of the system; the structural weak points of unreinforced dry-stack masonry, the general structural response of the system under seismic condition and the failure load. The plain dry-stack masonry failed at 0. 3 g and the conventional masonry failed at 0. 6 g. Finally recommendations for further strengthening of system to improve its lateral capacity were proposed...|$|E
40|$|Bauxite {{mining and}} alumina {{processing}} in Gove, northern Australia, produces residues that contain significant quantities of sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium aluminate, making the material highly alkaline, saline, and sodic. In an untreated condition these residues {{are incapable of}} supporting plant growth, and if left exposed and unstabilised they are highly susceptible to wind and water erosion, presenting a hazard to both man and the environment. Covering these wastes, preferably with vegetation that is native to the area, is therefore considered desirable. The current method of <b>dry</b> <b>stacking</b> bauxite residue necessitates separation into fine grained red mud (RM) and coarse grained residue sand (RS). Adverse chemical properties of RM inhibit plant growth, but moderately successful plant growth has been obtained in ameliorated (seawater neutralised/freshwater leached) RS, where the limitations are largely associated with water stress during the post-monsoon dry season. The water storage capacity of RS can be improved by increasing its fines content, but this can have a detrimental impact on other physical properties of the bauxite residue that are important for vegetative growth. This project aims to determine what effect increasing the fines content of RS has on the physical properties of bauxite residues, by assessing the suitability of various mixtures of RS and RM for supporting plant growth. Two distinctly different textured bauxite residues dominated by silt (RMsilt) and clay (RMclay) particles, were separated from RM by sedimentation and then ameliorated to reduce pH 1 : 5 to 8. 8, electrical conductivity 1 : 5 < 412 µScm- 1, and Na + < 28 cmolckg- 1. The RMsilt and RMclay materials were then added to RS at different ratios to create a range of clay (RS/RMclay) dominated mixtures; silt (RS/RMsilt) dominated mixtures; plus an equivalently textured RM. The effect of texture and structure on plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and penetration resistance (Pr) was assessed. Structure of puddled mixtures was altered using both crushing (< 2 mm) to simulate thorough tillage, and wetting and drying cycles for consolidation. The PAWC of bauxite residue was not significantly improved until fines content (silt + clay) was increased from 6 % in RS, to 39 % and 62 % in the RS/RMclay and RS/RMsilt mixtures respectively. Increasing the fines content of RS altered the void ratios of the mixtures, changing the pore size distribution from being dominated by large micro-pores in coarse mixtures {{to be dominated by}} smaller micro-pores in finer mixtures, which resulted in negligible change in PAWC of coarser textures. Crushing and consolidation increased water storage at potentials of - 0. 1 to - 10 kPa, with negligible effect on PAWC and water storage at lower water potentials. The PAWC of puddled RM was not greater than that of RS, but in crushed RM the PAWC was twice that of RS. The Ksat of mixtures tended to decrease as fines content increased, but increased with level of disturbance. In puddled mixtures Ksat was lowest (mean 0. 52 mmh- 1) and whilst not shown to be significant, Ksat seemed to be closely associated to packing density and void characteristics of the mixtures. Subjecting puddled materials to successive weathering cycles caused the samples to expand and crack increasing the Ksat of over half the textures by more than an order of magnitude. Crushing increased Ksat of all samples as water movement was no longer restricted to smaller inter-particle voids, but instead capable of moving through larger cracks and around secondary particles and aggregates. Wetting and drying of these crushed samples caused consolidation of particles, reducing Ksat due to the increased tortuousity. A quantitative measure of Ksat after wetting and drying cycles was not able to be attained in these experiments due to insufficient sample size. In puddled mixtures the penetrability at field capacity and wilting point was affected by packing of particles, wherein Pr increased with decreasing void ratio. Increasing the fines content of RS by only a small amount (13 - 15 %) resulted in a more than 6 fold increase in Pr of puddled mixtures. The Pr of all puddled mixtures other than RS was much higher than the penetrability considered highly restrictive to root elongation (2. 0 MPa). This was substantially lower (up to 96 %) in the crushed treatments, regardless of texture, and considered favorable to root growth, which suggests that a vital criterion for successful vegetation growth in neutralised bauxite residues is the breaking up of the massive structure. This work concluded that through drying and crushing is a prerequisite for plant growth in bauxite residues and that improvements in soil water availability are only identifiable in the RS when the fines content is increased substantially. To achieve successful plant establishment and sustainable vegetation cover it is recommended that deep ripping and thorough cultivation of puddled bauxite residues be carried out initially prior to propagation in order to improve water infiltration, reduce erodability, and facilitate root elongation...|$|E

Even once in place, cracking can often occur due to foundation movements. This thesis outlines an analysis of the <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> block method. ...|$|R

This {{new type}} of masonry block uses special {{curvature}} to allow the masonry block to stabilize through self weight when constructed as a panel. The principal practice of this panel is to help dissipate external energy, primarily due to seismic loadings. The basic concept is to generate friction between each element of the panel through movements to dissipate energy. SIM blocks were created by Dr Yuri Totoev from University of Newcastle, first introduced in print in 2011 in the Advance Material Research Journal. This theory was based on principles of <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> masonry wall construction, where energy dissipation depends significantly on the textural arrangement of the stones. The idea of SIM panel is to improve on the traditional reinforced masonry. The design principal is to allow construction without the requirements of traditional reinforced masonry.|$|R

The voles begin to construct the stacks around August, and by the winter, they may have reached considerable size, with piles of up to 50 cm in height having been reported. The piles {{are a source of}} nutritious food through the winter, although they are liable to be raided by other animals.|$|R

Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is {{expensive}} to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive.|$|R
