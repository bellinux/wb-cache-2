Alex Woolf {{suggested that}} Flann <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had come close to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to that created by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Only</b> after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E

Olds became an ace on both of his combat tours and was twice awarded the Silver Star, for the mission of August 25 and for the achievements of himself and his squadron during his combined tours.|$|E

5|$|As the First Baltic {{began moving}} towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, {{it became clear}} that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan's forces near Daugavpils, as he had {{previously}} predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so. Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E

5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E
5|$|From 1785 to 1799, Garrard {{served as}} a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University). In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal {{trustees}} united against the orthodox Presbyterian {{members of the board}} to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian minister from England. Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.|$|E

5|$|In France {{the battle}} was {{represented}} as a victory, largely based on a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley {{on the strength of}} a letter written by Captain Troude, which claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore by 07:00, but that he had then waited nearby until 10:00 in the hope of resuming the action. In reward for his services as represented, Troude was promoted and highly praised, later holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|One of Koniecpolski's {{greatest}} victories {{occurred during}} a winter 1644 campaign against Tatars. With a large army of some 19,000 soldiers (60% of them, magnates' private armies; Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200) he dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey's forces near Ochmatów on 30 January 1644. Many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice {{over the water}} gave way. The Battle of Ochmatów, the Commonwealth's greatest victory over the Tatars {{in the first half}} of the 17th century, brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> predicted the time and place of their attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual tactic of splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (czambuls).|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Toulmin's resignation, James Garrard, a Baptist {{minister}} who had supported Toulmin as {{a trustee of}} Transylvania, was elected governor of Kentucky. At first, Garrard elected to re-appoint sitting Secretary of State James Brown, but when Brown retired in October 1796, Garrard appointed Toulmin as his replacement. He served in this capacity from 1796 to 1804, spanning both of Garrard's consecutive terms as governor. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and his associate Augustine Eastin <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them as well.

5|$|The Bulgarian forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. In their attempts to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the point that}} the recapture of Kharkov was important politically, Hitler returned to the front on 10 March. Manstein carefully assembled his available forces along a wide front to prevent their encirclement and recaptured Kharkov on 14 March, after bloody street fighting in the Third Battle of Kharkov. For this accomplishment, he received the Oak Leaves for the Knight's Cross. Hausser's II SS Panzer Corps captured Belgorod on 18 March. Manstein's counteroffensive <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> prevented the disintegration of the entire front, it had regained substantial territory and resulted in the destruction of three Soviet armies and the retreat of three others. Soviet casualties for the preceding month in that sector had been 46,000 dead and 14,000 taken prisoner. Captured or destroyed were 600 tanks and 1,200 pieces of artillery. The spring thaw began by 23 March, ending operations in the area for the time being. Planning was then undertaken to eliminate the enemy salient at Kursk.|$|E
