McKinley Noble of GamePro also made mention of the impressive water dynamics, adding that the game's challenge rooms extend gameplay. Joystiq, however, was not impressed with the effects, stating [...] "the water isn't even as impressive as you might expect." [...] Peter Eykemans of TeamXbox stated that the dynamic water made each enemy confrontation unique, allowing the player to dispatch enemies in a variety of ways. Official Xbox Magazines staff praised the dynamic and emergent gameplay, stating [...] "the more you experiment with them, the more <b>Hydrophobia's</b> dynamic environments come to life".|$|R

500|$|Rabies is {{an often}} fatal disease {{caused by the}} {{infection}} of mammals with rabies virus. In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as [...] foxes and bats, {{but it is one}} of the oldest known virus diseases: rabies is a Sanskrit word (rabhas) that dates from 3000 BC, [...] which means [...] "madness" [...] or [...] "rage", and the disease has been known for over 4000years. Descriptions of rabies can be found in [...] Mesopotamian texts, and the ancient Greeks called it [...] "lyssa" [...] or [...] "lytta", meaning [...] "madness". [...] References to rabies can be found in the Laws of Eshnunna, which date from 2300BC. Aristotle (384–322 BC) wrote one of the earliest undisputed descriptions of the disease and how it was passed to humans. Celsus, in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called [...] and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison– to describe this he invented the [...] word [...] "virus". Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, <b>hydrophobia</b> and death.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its great}} {{hardness}} and strong molecular bonding, a cut diamond's facets and facet edges appear the flattest and sharpest. A curious {{side effect of}} diamond's surface perfection is <b>hydrophobia</b> combined with lipophilia. The former property means {{a drop of water}} placed on a diamond will form a coherent droplet, whereas in most other minerals the water would spread out to cover the surface. Similarly, diamond is unusually lipophilic, meaning grease and oil readily collect on a diamond's surface. Whereas on other minerals oil would form coherent drops, on a diamond the oil would spread. This property is exploited in the use of so-called [...] "grease pens," [...] which apply a line of grease to the surface of a suspect diamond simulant. Diamond surfaces are hydrophobic when the surface carbon atoms terminate with a hydrogen atom and hydrophilic when the surface atoms terminate with an oxygen atom or hydroxyl radical. Treatment with gases or plasmas containing the appropriate gas, at temperatures of 450°C or higher, can change the surface property completely. Naturally occurring diamonds have a surface with less than a half monolayer coverage of oxygen, the balance being hydrogen and the behavior is moderately hydrophobic. This allows for separation from other minerals at the mine using the so-called [...] "grease-belt".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Britain, Ninnis {{qualified}} in January 1867 {{for the title of}} Surgeon in the Royal Navy by passing examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons; the following month he was appointed to the Royal Hospital in Greenwich, where he remained until 1869. On 21 December 1874 he was promoted to Staff-Surgeon Second Class. In May 1875 he was appointed to HMS Discovery, one of two ships—the other HMS Alert—which comprised the British Arctic Expedition, led by Captain Sir George Nares. The expedition aimed {{to be the first to}} reach the North Pole, pushing north through Smith Sound, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. The two ships made slow progress up the sound, repeatedly halted by dense pack ice. During August of the first year, the expedition's Greenland Dogs began to show signs of disease; the dogs experienced fits and [...] "madness", owing, it was assumed, [...] "to close confinement, wet decks, and want of natural exercise." [...] Ninnis and Fleet-Surgeon Thomas Colon of the Alert were charged with investigating the disease. Ninnis' report to Nares noted the disease's similarity to rabies, [...] "but there is no instance recorded in Greenland of human beings who have been bitten having suffered from <b>hydrophobia</b> , and the recovery of the animals in some instances is entirely opposed to the recorded experience of true rabies." ...|$|E

[...] Eurogamer Italy's Davide Persiani also scored the updated game a [...] 7/10 and stated that though <b>Hydrophobia</b> Pure was not [...] "an absolute masterpiece, this new version of <b>Hydrophobia</b> surely deserves a look."

2500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} the harsh feedback and reviews the developers revisited core gameplay mechanics and issues addressed by both reviewers and <b>Hydrophobia</b> 's community. In an interview with gamesTM, Senior Creative Designer Rob Hewson discussed the process for addressing issues found.

[...] "Once we had analysed the data, we set about improving every single element of the game according to that data," [...] The subsequent updates were released in a title update dubbed <b>Hydrophobia</b> Pure on December 21, 2010. The 4 megabyte update contains various graphic and physics enhancements, remapped controls, overhauled camera and map systems, improved gameplay mechanics, additional HUD information and removal or shortening of dialogue and cutscenes.

2500|$|The HydroEngine is a {{video game}} engine created by Dark Energy Digital for <b>Hydrophobia.</b> Developed over three years, the engine has a unique {{capability}} to model flowing water and other liquids with a realism unprecedented in video games, according to the developers. It is entirely dynamic, which means the effect is not repeated and thus allowing different effects each time. InfiniteWorlds is Dark Energy's development platform, which interfaces directly with the HydroEngine. According to the developers, it is [...] "an underlying architecture, which can interface with bespoke editors tailored to individual game projects." [...] InfiniteWorlds was in development for five years.|$|E
2500|$|After its release, <b>Hydrophobia</b> {{received}} poor {{reviews from}} some media outlets, prompting contention between the developer and some reviewers. Pete Jones, Joint Design Director for Dark Energy Digital {{spoke of the}} difficulties experienced {{in an interview with}} GamingNexus. [...] "Criticism can be hard. You make games because you love games, perhaps on occasions we may have seemed a little too defensive and disappointed. Pride can be a big virtue as well because you need to be intensely proud of something you're creating in any endeavor." [...] Jones further stated that it was difficult to accept that some consumers and critics disliked the game. He conceded that [...] "if the community doesnt like it we try and change it no matter whose toes we tread on." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1UP.com's Matt Clark criticised {{the degree}} of {{repetition}} in the game. He stated that while using one of many varied ways to dispatch an enemy is fun the first time, the enjoyment loses its luster as the player repeats these actions. He further stated that [...] "without the dynamic water effects, <b>Hydrophobia</b> is just a passable Live Arcade title." [...] Edge also panned most of the core gameplay, saying [...] "the lacklustre combat, the imprecise platforming, the lack of meaningful feedback, the repetitive hunting for keys to locked doors, the over-fussy map, the intolerable cover system and the poor signposting that will leave even the most attentive player floundering for direction and purpose. These factors frustrate, pulling the game time and again under the high mark established by its water." [...] GamePros McKinley Noble cited stiff gameplay controls, awkward action sequences, and dated visuals adding that these weaknesses [...] "do enough harm to sabotage a unique idea." [...] Noble further stated that the game [...] "drowns under a sea of irritating technical flaws." [...] TeamXbox's Peter Eykemans criticised the game's pacing, stating [...] "when you're forced to kill with just your stun rounds or aren't quite sure where to head next, the entire experience slows down." ...|$|E
