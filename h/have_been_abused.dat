5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have {{different}} abuse potential; the more rapid {{the increase in}} the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E
25|$|While the genders {{engage in}} IPV at about equal rates, females {{are more likely}} to use less {{dangerous}} forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males {{are more likely to}} punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males {{are also more likely to}} use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|E

25|$|Since then, the {{government}} has expropriated other valuable land, mostly the homes of poor and middle-class Equatoguineans. Thousands {{of people have been}} the victims of these seizures, for which very few of them are compensated and in response to which they have no legal recourse. Many of those who have protested these expropriations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> and intimidated by soldiers or police. Officially, these lands are seized for public purposes, but in fact they have ended {{up in the hands of}} members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, who have built homes or businesses on the properties. In 2003, for example, Le Temps (Geneva) reported on a village in which 75 people lived in abject poverty having been uprooted by the regime from their homes, which had been used to construct a methanol factory without compensation or apology. A 2013 Amnesty report stated that over 1,000 families in the country had been forcibly removed from their homes so that {{the government}} could build roads, luxury homes and hotels, and shopping centers. Many of the homes demolished were in perfect shape, with the vast majority of those living there holding land titles. Despite promises from the government to relocate victims to new homes, to date no one has been compensated in any way.|$|E
2500|$|There {{continues}} to be some debate regarding gender differences with relation to domestic violence. Limitations of methodology that fail to capture context (e.g., conflict tactics scale), disparate sampling procedures, respondent reluctance to self-report, and differences in operationalization all pose challenges to existing research. [...] Normalization of domestic violence in those who experience covert forms of abuse, or <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> by multiple partners, {{for long periods of}} time, reduces the likelihood of recognizing, and therefore reporting domestic violence.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has often}} been assumed that a {{preference}} for BDSM {{is a consequence of}} childhood abuse. Research indicates that there is no evidence for this claim. [...] Some reports suggest that people abused as children may have more BDSM injuries and have difficulty with safe words being recognized as meaning stop the previously consensual behavior, thus, it is possible that people choosing BDSM as part of their lifestyle, who also were previously abused, may have had more police or hospital reports of injuries.

2500|$|For Ridley, {{on matters}} of indifference, one must defer {{conscience}} to the authorities of the church, or else [...] "thou showest thyself a disordered person, disobedient, as [...] contemner of lawful authority, and a wounder of thy weak brother his conscience."

2500|$|Societies {{in which}} [...] "family honor" [...] is {{considered}} highly important generally place a correspondingly {{high degree of}} restriction {{of the freedom of}} women. In these cultures, a family may defend its honor, or may seek reparation or revenge if the family honor is perceived to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> or treated with disrespect. In Ancient Rome, sexual activity of married women outside of their marriage was seen as dishonor to the family and it was legal for men to kill their wives or married daughters that shamed the family through adultery. Reasoning for the designation of women to private and/or nonmale areas comes from the ancient tradition of a woman's place in the world. Women are not seen as independent individuals, but rather extensions of their male counterparts' identity and honor.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that {{disabled}} people are disproportionately affected by disability abuse and bullying, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime. The bullying {{is not limited to}} those who are visibly disabled – such as wheelchair-users or individuals with physical deformities (e.g., cleft lip) – but also those with learning disabilities such as autism and developmental coordination disorder. In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an ignorant physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which the disabled <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> by staff of a [...] "care institution", such as the case revealed in a BBC Panorama programme on a Castlebeck care home (Winterbourne View) near Bristol, leading to its closure and suspension or firing of staff members.|$|E
2500|$|Petty's only {{statistical}} {{technique is}} the use of simple averages. He would not be a statistician by today's standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data. Because obtaining census data was difficult, if not impossible, especially for Ireland, he applied methods of estimation. The way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of London. He would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths. His method of using exports is by considering that a 30 percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population. The way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by 30 – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year. To obtain the population of all of England he would multiply the population of London by 8. Such a simple use of estimation could have easily <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abused</b> and Petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the Crown. (Henry Spiegel) ...|$|E
