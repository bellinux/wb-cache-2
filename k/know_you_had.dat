500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis {{indicated}} that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to The Getaway. Kiedis [...] "I think it's good {{to work with the}} same guy again to um, you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with this guy and see what we can accomplish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> this Meader {{business}} in mind," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> fanciful notions about--some things. Never told you I didn't want you here, did I?" ...|$|R
