25|$|The use of {{quotation}} marks, {{also called}} <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> or speech marks, {{is complicated by}} the fact that there are two kinds: single quotation marks (') and double quotation marks ("). British usage, at one stage in the recent past, preferred single quotation marks for ordinary use, but double quotation marks are again now increasingly common; American usage has always preferred double quotation marks, as does Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand English. It is the practice to alternate the type of quotation marks used where there is a quotation within a quotation.|$|E

Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense."

Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he {{recovered}} to continue his innings.

Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64.

He described [...] "The 'Sweetest Girl'" [...] as [...] "the tendency for things to fall apart in the light of political awareness", or as he put it more directly in another interview, [...] "It's got {{a lot to do with}} the promise and the myth and the cliché of the sweetest girl", or how the male idealised vision of the perfect girl was a myth, hence the <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> around the song's title (a subject and a grammatical trick he would later return to on the 1986 hit single [...] "The Word 'Girl'").

Appropriate fixation of glenoid component of scapula {{is essential to}} evade loosening which is the common indication for revision surgery. The glenoid cavity is small and allows only a restricted spot for limited fixation devices. For this reason, knowledge of the morphology of glenoid cavity is important.

50|$|This {{situation}} {{persists in}} many languages. Despite efforts at reform by local academies, the general conservative resistance to orthographic change {{has led to}} varying results in Polynesian languages, and several writing variants co-exist. The most common method, however, uses a macron to indicate a long vowel, while a vowel without that diacritical mark is short, for example, ā versus a. Sometimes, a long vowel is written double, e.g. Maaori. The glottal stop (not present in all Polynesian languages, but where present {{is one of the}} most common consonants) is indicated by an apostrophe, for example, a versus a. This is somewhat of an anomaly as the apostrophe is most often used to represent letters that have been omitted, while the glottal stop is rather a consonant that is not written. The problem can somewhat be alleviated by changing the simple apostrophe for a curly one, taking a normal apostrophe for the elision and the <b>inverted</b> <b>comma</b> for the glottal stop. The latter method has come into common use in Polynesian languages.|$|R
40|$|Background: The lateral {{angle of}} scapula becomes {{truncated}} and broadened and form the glenoid cavity which shows variable morphology. There is a notch present on its anterosuperior part which gives its different shape. When this glenoid notch is indistinct its shape is piriform, {{when it is}} distinct it looks like <b>inverted</b> <b>comma</b> shape {{and when it is}} absent its oval shape. The shoulder joint is one among the most commonly dislocated joints in the body. The fracture of glenoid with dislocations is very common in the trauma. The detail knowledge about variation in anatomy of glenoid cavity like different shape, size and dimensions are important during designing and fitting of glenoid component for total shoulder arthroplasty. The objective of present study was to obtain anthropometric data of scapulae and the glenoid cavity specifically the diameters and various shape of glenoid belongs to population of Bihar and compare it to findings from other races of the world. Methods: The present study was a cross sectional study which has been carried out on 228 undamaged dry adult human scapulae in which 126 belongs to right side and 102 belongs to left side. The age and gender of the bones used in the study was not predetermined. Results: The most common shape of glenoid cavity recorded {{in the present study was}} pear shape (50. 44 %) followed by <b>inverted</b> <b>comma</b> shape (35. 96 %). The least common shape was oval (13. 6 %). The mean length of scapula was observed as 135. 07 +/- 14. 23 mm, the mean breadth of scapula was 97. 55 +/- 9. 63 mm, the mean supero inferior glenoid diameter was 35. 80 +/- 3. 14 mm, the mean antero posterior glenoid diameter 1 was 23. 63 +/- 2. 50 mm, and the mean antero posterior glenoid diameter 2 was 16. 17 +/- 2. 24 mm and mean glenoid cavity index was 66. 40 +/- 8. 14 %. In all the above measurements bilateral differences was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The knowledge about the different shape and dimensions of glenoid are very important during designing and fitting of glenoid component for total shoulder arthroplasty. It is also helpful during evaluation of different pathological conditions like rotator cuff disease, osteochondral defects and Bankart lesion. Since the present study is conducted on a limited number of scapulae further cadaveric, radiological and clinical studies are indicated. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (7. 000) : 2770 - 2776...|$|R
