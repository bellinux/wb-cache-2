500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{relocated}} to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired {{over a period}} of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging". Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station's Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland. Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge. Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.|$|E

500|$|After the 1997 provincial election, Klein {{appointed}} Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development. While he {{held this}} office, his department encouraged {{the establishment of}} feedlots. The opposition parties charged {{that the government was}} not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them. On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces. Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature. [...] 1997's Meat Inspection Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case. It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol [...] "a really good bill". The Livestock and Livestock Products Amendment Act of the same year eliminated government guarantee of the Livestock Patrons' Assurance Fund, designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers, in favour of leaving the Fund entirely {{in the hands of the}} industry. It too was supported by the Liberals, with Nicol calling it [...] "very <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to accept". [...] In 1998, Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes (Penalties) Amendment Act, which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes, setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis. It also passed with Liberal support, as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it [...] "really makes a lot of sense". Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act, which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans, and was supported by the opposition. [...] Finally, Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes (Livestock Identification) Amendment Act, which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry. The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading, but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading.|$|E

Or, [...] say, 'I don't like you.'" [...] She added, [...] "But I've always thought that, deep inside, Tony loves Ziva and Ziva loves Tony, but she's almost ashamed of saying it because he's so stupid. In the best of ways.

2500|$|However, Anne Rice has {{consistently}} and aggressively prevented fan fiction based {{on any of}} her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles). She, along with Anne McCaffrey (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and Raymond Feist, have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net. George R.R. Martin, who was selected by Time magazine {{as one of the}} [...] "2011 Time 100" [...] and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe, Lee saying that [...] "Nobody else is going to get it right.

2500|$|The Nottingham preview was the {{production}} reviewed in The Guardian on 28 September 1954, {{rather than the}} later West End opening. The critic was not over-enthusiastic, calling it, [...] "Confusing" [...] and stating, [...] "The piece hardly calls for moralising, though {{there will always be}} people who find it hard to laugh at jokes about the disposal of corpses. Yet it is as comedy, rather than mystery, that it must stand or fall. Miss Lockwood, though born to be sincere, has the job here of hauling rather substantial red herrings all over the stage to try and give us the impression that she is a sly minx who has either done the deed herself or else is shielding her neurotic little stepdaughter. Tonight's audience evidently fell deeply for the wiles of Miss Lockwood. Artful finger on chin, or fluttering hand emphasising some particularly disingenuous point, she earns every word of the police inspector's tribute when he says: 'You haven't made things <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> with your tall stories.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Truffaut premiered The Green Room in the US at the 1978 New York Film Festival {{where its}} {{reception}} was again ill-fated. Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave the film a mixed review and criticized Truffaut's performance, saying that [...] "Truffaut {{does not make}} it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to respond to Davenne". Canby goes on to call the film [...] " [...] a most demanding, original work and one must meet it on its own terms, without expectations of casual pleasures." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader said that the film [...] "dead-ends in sheer neurosis" [...] while praising the cinematography. A negative review from Time Out blamed the film's [...] "failure" [...] on [...] "Truffaut's lack of range as an actor [...] is not helped by the script's purple prose." [...] Truffaut himself eventually reflected on the reception of The Green Room as a case where he was able to [...] "get out of trouble", rather than simply assert [...] "I succeeded", in relation to the commercial failure but general critical success of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys jingling.). Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and I think we just figured that we had exhausted that sound. It was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to replicate, it was easy for other bands to replicate, and we just needed to move on." ...|$|E
