As a small child, Durova learned all the standard marching commands and her favorite toy was an unloaded gun.|$|E

Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E

25|$|Franchise was off Curaçao on 24 April 1805 {{when she}} sighted a {{schooner}} that anchored under the guns {{of the fort}} of Port Maria.

The schooner had a crew of a lieutenant and 35 men, but a number escaped ashore, leaving behind 24 of their wounded compatriots, as well as the surgeon and the lieutenant. Franchise had one man seriously wounded and two men slightly wounded. The schooner was carrying lumber and rice.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs {{supplies}} placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death twice. Twelve tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, remain after the first day. Katniss tries {{to stay away from the}} others, but Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait <b>her</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of tracker jackers, genetically modified poisonous wasps. Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest despite being stung; it falls on the sleeping Careers. Peeta, Marvel, Cato, and Clove escape, but Glimmer succumbs to the venom. Disoriented, Katniss flees from the site.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull <b>her</b> <b>out</b> (<b>the</b> Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} {{in charge of}} the Phoenix VA facility, who had been on administrative leave for almost seven months, was fired. While on administrative leave, she was paid over $90,000. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, said that the payments were [...] "a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans." [...] Dr. Sam Foote said that the firing was [...] "a good first step" [...] and that [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of others who need to follow <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door." ...|$|E

David did find out the name of the building where she worked at and staked <b>her</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> names {{of the people in the}} title of the law firm are friends Larry David made at college.|$|E
500|$|Just after Day's 21st {{birthday}} in June 1769, he and John Bicknell travelled to the Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital {{to choose the}} first girl for his experiment. Sabrina was 12 {{years old at the}} time, described as [...] "a clear auburn brunette, with darker eyes more glowing bloom and chestnut tresses". She was slender, and had long eyelashes and a pleasant voice. Day was struggling to choose a girl for the experiment, and Bicknell quickly picked <b>her</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> pair did not tell the orphanage secretary, Samuel Magee, about the planned experiment. Instead they told him that she was to be indentured as a servant at Edgeworth's country house in Berkshire, waiving the £4 (...) fee they would have received for the apprenticeship. In line with the orphanage's requirements that responsibility be held by a married man, Edgeworth would be legally accountable for Sabrina, despite him not being present nor even aware of the arrangement.|$|E

500|$|The Haunting {{is notable}} for its lesbian character, Theodora. Although the character's {{lesbianism}} is subtly {{mentioned in the}} novel, the film makes it explicit. The film {{is also one of}} the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory. Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator. Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: [...] "I hate you" [...] is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit. According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, 10 November, Charteris {{attacked}} and raped Bond. There were no witnesses, and Charteris' servants {{in the next}} room later testified that they heard nothing. When Bond told Charteris she was going to the authorities over the crime, he ordered servants to whip her and take her belongings and throw <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door, telling them that she had stolen money from him. [...] With assistance from Mary Parsons, perhaps a former employer, Bond brought a complaint for the misdemeanour of [...] "assault with intent to commit rape." [...] The Middlesex grand jury originally found grounds to proceed with this charge but later upgraded the charge to the capital felony of rape.|$|E

Now, the two are second-year high school students, but Hotaru is {{anything}} but innocent. Yuma gets her first boyfriend and is nervous about it, so a more experienced Hotaru suggests a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] to help <b>her</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> helping out later on leads to a deep kiss with Hotaru, who says that Yuma now knows how to kiss a guy. This leaves her thinking about how much better this kiss was than {{the one she had}} shared with her boyfriend. As time goes on, Yuma worries that her boyfriend will find out what is going on between her and Hotaru. She also cannot explain these [...] "strange" [...] feelings she has when she is with her.|$|E
2500|$|However, on 9 July Duncan spotted {{an enemy}} {{merchant}} vessel, and her escorts, two gunboats, each {{armed with a}} 24-pounder gun, all sailing along the coast. Porcupine was becalmed off Monte Circello, Romania so Duncan sent in her boats. After rowing eight hours in the heat, the boats succeeded in driving the merchant vessel on shore and the gunboats to take shelter under the guns of two shore batteries at Port d'Anzo (Anzio). Three more French vessels arrived and succeeded in getting into the harbour. One of the vessels was a large polacca of six guns, and she anchored a little further out than the other vessels. That evening Duncan sent in the boats again to cut <b>her</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> polacca, which had a crew of some 20-30 men, was expecting an attack and had tied her to the beach. French soldiers were on the beach, and the polacca was within close range of the batteries, a tower, and the gunboats. Still, the British succeeded in capturing her and getting her out to sea, though it took them {{about an hour and}} twenty minutes to do so. The polacca had been sailing from Hieres Bay to Naples with a cargo of salt. In the attack, the British suffered eight men wounded, including Lieutenant Price, who was severely injured in his head and leg. He received a promotion to commander for this and earlier achievements in some 30 boat actions. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "10 July Boat Service 1808" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
