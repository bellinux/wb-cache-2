5|$|Veronica {{connects the}} five {{people who were}} framed to an {{incident}} where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> the names of a company's shareholders. Veronica believes that one of the lab assistants was paid off to forge the results. The previous summer, Logan was involved with an arson crime. Logan sunbathes with Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver (Kyle Gallner) poolside, and they ogle at the brothers's stepmother, Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter). Veronica sets up the parents and has Principal Clemmons listen in, and it is revealed that Duncan is now dating Veronica. In a flashback, Veronica breaks up with Logan.

25|$|Stroke is {{diagnosed}} through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with {{assistance from the}} imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> the likely cause of stroke.|$|E
25|$|Since grade-crossing {{accidents}} {{typically do}} {{not lead to}} fatalities on board the train, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were particularly interested in determining why the fatalities occurred. They believed that fuel from the SUV may have combined with sparks from the dislodged third rail to cause a fire on board the train. They were interested <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> how the SUV driver got into the position she did in the first place; the detour caused by the earlier road accident may also have played a role.|$|E

To avoid capture, Billy determines to cross to Mexico, and Bridge elects to come along.|$|R
25|$|Vascular {{anomalies}} – vascular malformations, hemangiomas, {{and rare}} vascular tumors. Not only do vascular anomalies have often prominent interior bodily effects; they manifest themselves physically as well. For this reason, {{the involvement of}} multiple specialties in coordinating care is of utmost importance. Specialists involve in vascular anomalies and hemangioma care often hail from the disciplines of general surgery, vascular anomalies research, plastic surgery, dermatology, cardiology, hematology/oncology, neurology/neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, and otolaryngology. The child needs treatment not only to minimize the physical side effects of a hemangioma or vascular anomalies, but also help <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> why the tumor is present (if {{it is in fact}} a tumor), and developing a course of treatment if necessary.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1982, Janet Harduvel (Laura Dern) is {{devastated by}} {{the news of the}} death of her husband Ted (Vincent Spano) who flew as a United States Air Force pilot in one of the world's most {{sophisticated}} fighter aircraft, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. She is stymied <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> the truth behind his crash in Korea and takes on the US military and General Dynamics, maker of the F-16. With the help of her lawyer, Leo Morrone (Robert Loggia), and her sister Mary (Welker White), Harduvel begins the long process of unraveling the lies and deception that are behind a joint military and General Dynamics cover-up that blames the accident on pilot error. Despite setbacks, she proves to be unwavering in her search for the truth to clear his name and uncover the deadly secret buried in the F-16.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1985, Ballard was {{aboard the}} French {{research}} ship Le Suroît, which {{was using the}} side scan sonar SAR {{to search for the}} Titanics wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS Scorpion and the USS Thresher, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the Titanic. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the Argo, and his search for the Titanic. The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that Argo was their best chance to do so. The Navy agreed it would finance his Titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines, and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time, and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the Titanic.|$|E

Frank appears naive, but his character is a complex as Miranda's. Graphic scenes of sex and seduction illustrate Frank's fantasy and unrealistic love for Miranda. She suddenly disappears, and he tracks her down <b>in</b> London, <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> that she is actually a con artist. He leaves her, returning to Northern England.|$|R
25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E

500|$|Francis Galton (1822–1911) was {{a pioneer}} in {{investigating}} both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book Hereditary Genius, writing before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose near' genius or genius" [...] as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term [...] "genius" [...] as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, Wechsler specifically commented that [...] "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score." ...|$|E

500|$|Tina Charles of TV Guide {{feels that}} Bobby [...] "totally rocks", and [...] "wouldn't mind him in every [...] OK, every other one". She pointed out Beaver's {{chemistry}} with Ackles, and wrote, [...] "I have always loved any scene {{we get that}} involves —they're unexpectedly emotional. When Bobby finally realized he wasn't talking to a Dean shapeshifter or revenant , {{that this was the}} real deal, it was just awesome." [...] Charles was surprised by Bobby's paralysis storyline, but became [...] "really interested" [...] <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> how it would affect him. However, she posited, [...] "The guy's a spitfire...and it probably won't change him much." [...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them that there is more to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done an outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby has run the gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E
500|$|Screen Rant's Kevin Yeoman, gave much praise in the episode. Like Paste {{magazine}} {{and other critics}} reviews, Yeoman claimed that [...] "there was certainly disappointment <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> that Awake wouldn't see a second season, and would instead be looked at as a 13-episode miniseries". He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points {{that are similar to}} [...] "That's Not My Penguin" [...] and [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend". Again, Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review. He called it [...] "promising". He noted that he could see [...] "why Awake was canceled". He blessed [...] "the show for at least trying". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "original". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fascinating", [...] "puzzling" [...] and [...] "moving". Carl Cortez of Assignment X, again, enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "B+" [...] grade review, he noted that [...] "you can view it as another missed opportunity". He claimed that parts of the episode were [...] "confusing". He stated that he would [...] "prefer to have more questions than answers". He argued that the episode felt more like a [...] "Series Finale, than Season Finale", which he called [...] "a good thing", [...] "Too many good shows go off into the sunset without a single resolution and this one at least strives for something more". He also argued that NBC should have [...] "put a little more promotional push". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
2500|$|Bowlby was {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> {{the patterns of}} family interaction involved in both healthy and pathological development. He focused on how attachment difficulties were transmitted {{from one generation to}} the next. In his development of attachment theory, he proposed the idea that attachment behaviour was an evolutionary survival strategy for protecting the infant from predators. Mary Ainsworth, a student of Bowlby's, further extended and tested his ideas. [...] She played the primary role in suggesting that several attachment styles existed.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the BMJ, Wessely indicated that although viruses and other infections are clearly involved in triggering the onset of CFS, he would not endlessly investigate for infective causes, using the analogy of a hit and run accident <b>in</b> which <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> the make or number plate of the car that hits you doesn't help the doctor trying to mend the injury, repeating that we are [...] "in the business of rehabilitation".|$|R
50|$|In October 1789 Penn met a Frenchman named Benoit Vial de St. Bel who was <b>in</b> England <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> about {{agriculture}} and thoroughbred horses. He had trained and qualified at the French veterinary {{school and was}} also trying, unsuccessfully, to interest the English in establishing a veterinary school in England. The combined efforts of Penn and St Bel resulted in a plan for an English school and, for the first time, someone who could provide the teaching experience required.|$|R
6000|$|Some persons {{appear to}} have the knack of getting their wishes granted. Jack is one of that ilk. Just as he made the remark, Davenport sauntered <b>in</b> and, <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> what was going on, volunteered to tell a ghost story himself--something that had {{happened}} to his grandmother, or maybe it was his great-aunt; I forget which. It was a very good ghost story as ghost stories go, and Davenport told it well. Even Jack admitted that, but he said: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next month}} {{she was called}} into her supervisor's supervisor's office, and told {{to go to an}} {{employee}} counseling service, an act she knew to be punitive, [...] "because you look stressed". The therapist who spoke with her seemed to Francis to be more interested <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> what she knew about the Lazarus case and who she might have shared it with. After two sessions in which she declined to share that information, she was again called into her supervisor's office and told she was not cooperating and needed to [...] "talk this out". She told the therapist she was getting a lawyer, after which further sessions were canceled as a [...] "mistake".|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{producers}} from E! started managing Hank, and soon he was being offered various paying gigs to make appearances at bachelor parties, bars, strip clubs, etc. [...] His manager related {{in an interview that}} [...] "Hank was diligent <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> every fine detail about his appearances and treated them with the utmost professionalism." [...] Hank would be hired to sing karaoke, bartend, or hurl insults. [...] He also started [...] merchandising a line of T-shirts and key chains. Hank, once dependent on disability checks, was now making $5,000–7,000 per month. [...] He had bought himself a new stereo, and was most excited about almost being out of credit card debt.|$|E
2500|$|The February Revolution caught Smochină {{behind the}} Caucasian Front. He was {{appointed}} military delegate by a Congress of Peoples in Tbilisi, sent over to Petrograd for {{negotiations with the}} Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (summer 1917). As he later noted, he happened to hear a speech given by Vladimir Lenin, leader of the ultra-revolutionary Bolshevik faction, who was working to topple the Russian Provisional Government. Smochină was intrigued by Lenin's promise of self-determination for all of Russia's minorities: [...] "As a Moldavian, I found this issue {{to be one of}} greatest interest". Smochină was interested <b>in</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> Lenin's level of commitment in this respect, and was received for an interview (as he recalled, this was only possible because one of Lenin's bodyguards was originally from Mahala).|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic (4.5/5) - {{states that}} [...] "not {{only does the}} music {{stand on its own}} (there's a reason why {{thousands}} of young DJs and vinyl hounds collapsed <b>in</b> confoundment upon <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> that these rare gems were being issued together), but the liner notes provide a story behind each song, only adding to the mystique." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ninufa is the pet of Itsushi and {{the guardians}} of the Rose Cards. He was {{responsible}} for knocking off Aníse's choker, resulting <b>in</b> him <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> {{that she was the}} missing Rose Princess. Ninufa has an appearance of a bat, though he can also transform into a dragon. The creature tends to talk in a slang style with the words [...] "da" [...] used regularly and is unusually seen eating at least once per chapter. Among the four current Rose Knights, he is personally closer to Seiran.|$|R
