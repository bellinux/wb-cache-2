5|$|Bauer met {{fellow student}} Ester Ellqvist at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Ellqvist {{studied at the}} {{separate}} department for women, since women {{were not allowed to}} attend the same classes as the men and their education was conducted in a different manner. So, while Ellqvist was talented and ambitious, she did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> opportunity as her male colleagues to develop her artistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E
5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} voting is the winner.|$|E

30|$|Random {{sampling}} is {{the simplest}} and widely used sampling technique. In random sampling, each item or element of the population <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> chance of being selected at each draw. A sample is random if the method for obtaining the sample meets the criterion of randomness (each element <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> chance at each draw).

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully {{in the life of}} their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> say in lawmaking.|$|E
25|$|Controlling abusers may use {{multiple}} {{tactics to}} exert {{power and control}} over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.

25|$|New liberals {{began to}} adapt the old {{language}} of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> opportunity of success.|$|E

25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, neuroticism {{has been}} shown to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal,</b> if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.|$|E
25|$|As an adolescent, Rankin cleaned, sewed, {{and helped}} {{care for her}} younger siblings, in {{addition}} to sharing in the outdoor work and daily farm chores.

25|$|Two full decks are dealt between eight players, forming four teams. Team {{members are}} spaced {{so that they}} are not able to see any other hands.

There is an increased possibility that when one team declares trump another team may <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> number of trump also, which may lead to an interesting game. An optional scoring rule rewards 1,000 points for a quadruple pinochle—four jacks of diamonds and four queens of spades in a meld.|$|E
