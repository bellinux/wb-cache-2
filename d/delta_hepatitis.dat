40|$|<b>Delta</b> <b>{{hepatitis}}</b> or hepatitis D {{leads to}} acute and chronic liver disease in humans. The causative agent, the {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV), is a defective virus which leads to hepatitis in humans {{in the presence of}} the hepatitis B virus. This helper function of HBV is required for transmission and propagation of HDV infection but not for replication. HDV RNA replication occurs through the double-rolling circle model and does not possess a reverse transcription step. Hepatitis D-induced liver disease is immune-mediated and occurs either as co-infection of both viruses or as superinfection of a hepatitis B carrier with hepatitis D. Based on a sequence variation of 19 - 38 &#x 0025;, to date seven genotypes of HDV have been described. HDV infection has declined significantly in many endemic areas in the last decades, however, due to migration to industrialized countries, this decline appears to have reached a plateau in western countries. The clinical course of <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in general is associated with rapid progression. <b>Delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> may be an additional risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The only established management for <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> consists of treatment with interferon for a period of at least one year.

40|$|SUMMARY Infection {{with the}} delta agent can only {{occur in the}} context of coexistent {{hepatitis}} B virus infection. We describe a patient in whom the clinical features of acute <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> developed when seroconversion from hepatitis B surface antigen to antibody had already occurred and diagnosis of recent acute hepatitis B was based on high titre IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. We discuss the significance of such a serological profile, not previously described. Rizzetto and colleagues ' first recognised the existence of the delta agent in 1977 while staining liver tissue by immunofluorescence for hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). An early observation was that delta antigen was only present in the livers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Infectivity studies in chimpanzees showed that delta infection could occur with both acute and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection. 2 In contrast, <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> could not be induced in HBsAg negative animals with circulating antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Seroepidemiological investiga-tions confirmed that the delta antigen-antibody system was only detectable in HBsAg carriers, except in rare individuals recently recovered from acute HBV and delta infection. 3 We describe a patient with acute <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> who at presentation had serological evidence of recent HBV infection but was HBsAg negative.

40|$|The large <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> antigen (HDAg) {{has been}} found to be {{essential}} for the assembly of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> virion. Furthermore, in a cotransfection experiment, the large HDAg itself, without the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> virus (HDV) genome and small HDAg, could be packaged into hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles. By deletion analysis, it was shown that the amino-terminal leucine zipper domain was dispensable for packaging. The large HDAg could also help in copackaging of the small HDAg into HBsAg particles without the need for HDV RNA. This process was probably mediated through direct interaction of the two HDAgs as a mutated large HDAg whose leucine zipper domain was deleted such that it could not help in copackaging of the small HDAg. This mutated large HDAg did not suppress HDV replication, suggesting that this effect is probably also via protein interaction. These results indicated that functional domains of the large HDAg responsible for packaging with HBsAg particles and for the trans-negative effect on HDV replication can be separated. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> virus (HDV) is a satellite of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (17, 18) and possesses a unique, single-stranded circular RNA genome (6, 21).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{a paucity}} of data {{available}} on the exact prevalence of <b>delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> among HBsAg positive carriers in Saudi Arabia. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the exact prevalence of delta antibody in HBsAg positive carriers in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 1997 the serum of 19, 250 patients was tested for HBsAg. HBsAg positive sera were subsequently tested for delta antibody. In addition, 3147 healthy blood donors underwent HBsAg testing. Those who were HBsAg positive had delta antibody testing using the ELISA method. RESULTS: Among 19, 250 patients, 780 (4. 1 &#x 0025;) were HBsAg positive, of which 67 (8. 6 &#x 0025;) patients were anti-delta positive and 2 (0. 25 &#x 0025;) were anti-delta borderline.

40|$|<b>Delta</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{virus is}} a new human {{pathogen}} always found associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) causing both fulminant hepatitis and the accelerated progression of pre-existing HBV hepatitis. The virus is coated in HBsAg and contains circular single stranded RNA genome with very high intramolecular base-pairing, similar to the genomes of plant viroids, and the HDV antigen, a specific marker of HDV infection {{also found in the}} nuclei of infected hepatocytes. The genome is about 1700 nucleotides long and of minus polarity with a major constant antigenomic Open Reading Frame (ORF) which codes for the antigen. Replication of viral RNA appears to proceed by a rolling circle mechanism and specific self-cleavage and self-ligation of both genomic and antigenomic HDV RNA strands has been demonstrated in vitro. HDV appears to require HBsAg for its propagation and hepatotropism but not to depend on H BV for replication. In 1977 Rizzetto et al. 1 reported the observation of a new viral antigen present in the nuclei of hepatocytes in patients infected with hepatitis B virus. Subsequent studies confirmed the original observation and revealed that the new antigen was related to a new agent, later termed hepatitis delta virus or HDV. <b>DELTA</b> <b>HEPATITIS</b> Natural history and epidemiology The new defective virus has an RNA genome, is coated in hepatitis B virus surface antigen and is dependent on pre-existing or concomitant HBV infection for propagation. 2 In the former case...|$|E
