500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it was like, when are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best {{to take care of}} the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. [...] Now let’s play breaking up.' That will be different." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 28 May 2009, Sigur Rós {{announced}} that they had almost completed recording their latest album.

5000|$|He {{was drafted}} in the 14th round by the Minnesota Twins in 1989. He made his major league debut for the Twins in 1992, with the team in a pennant race. He went 3-2 with a 3.30 ERA in 46 innings, which earned him the team's Rookie of the Year Award. Trombley played with many {{well-known}} players in 1993, including Kirby Puckett, Rick Aguilera and Dave Winfield. Early in his career, Trombley contributed to Indians designated hitter Eddie Murray's 3000th hit on June 30, 1995. He was sent to AAA for a short time, which drove him to start using a split finger fastball. In 1996, Trombley was recalled from AAA Salt Lake City to the Twins in 1996, and {{would be one of}} the most prominent relief pitchers in the league. He finished in the top six in appearances from 1998 through 2000. In 1999, when he was a free agent, Trombley posted 24 saves, which led to him signing a three-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles for $7.75 million. His departure left the Twins looking for a closer. The team had hoped to keep Trombley; Twins general manager Terry Ryan said, [...] "That certainly puts a hole in the back end of our bullpen, so we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> making alternative plans.". Trombley pitched 634 innings for the Twins and ended his Twins career with 30 wins, 34 losses, and 34 saves.|$|E

5000|$|The Gifted was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 15 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Besides being solidly built and not overstuffed at 16 tracks long, The Gifted is the fascinating sound {{of the life of the}} party growing up, and that's as in [...] "in the process," [...] because there are still plenty of club bangers, strip-club jams, and irresponsible moments, and all of them are welcome." [...] Eric Diep of XXL gave the album an XL, saying [...] "Matching his lyrical abilities with polished production and radio-ready hooks, The Gifted sees Wale inching towards hip-hop’s upper echelon, while still exhibiting the hunger of a young MC on the rise. “Born to lose, built to win,” he claims on “Heaven’s Afternoon.” Started from that bottom, but now he’s got it." [...] Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "When he plays to his strengths on The Gifted, the results are impressive, but more mass-market tracks leave him sounding unoriginal and anonymous." [...] Miles Raymer of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 5.1 out of ten, saying [...] "What seems to be the main purpose of the record is to elevate Wale beyond the level of Rick Ross’ reliable second-stringer, a guy who’s capable of dropping the occasional strip club anthem in between a steady string of unremarkable features on pop songs. “Clappers” proves that when he embraces that job he’s actually really good at it. But if he wants to be taken as a serious artist like the ones he spends most of the record emulating, he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> taking some real chances and get real far out of the box, out to place where people are known to wear kilts." ...|$|E

I wish we could've seen what would've happened {{when we got to the}} start-finish line. I felt like I maybe had (winner Denny Hamlin) squared up a little bit off turn 11 and maybe could've drag raced him to the line. It'd have been fun to see, but it was all not to be with getting hit in the left rear. It's unfortunate, but it was hard racing at the end, all of us going for a win and all of us locked in the Chase. I guess (Keselowski) kind of races with that mentality, that 'Hey, it doesn't really matter where we finish or if we finish,' so I just have to be mindful of that when we're around him for the rest of the time."

[...] "Our last corner there, racing with Kyle I just… I can’t sorry enough ," [...] Allmendinger said after the race. [...] "It doesn’t help the case, I spun him out. I didn’t mean to spin him out. The No. 78 was spinning and I was starting to get my nose under Kyle to try to drag race him to the checkered. He was turning to come back down, but it was my fault. For fourth place it would be different if we were battling for the win, but I just hate it for him. It’s not going to help to say sorry, I know, I would be pissed off. He should be. I was going to be okay with that until that." [...] Larson responded by saying Allmendinger [...] "had already ran me down to the front stretch wall once with about 15 to go or so. Pretty dumb move right there too, but I was the smarter one racing for points, lifted, could have wrecked him, but didn’t. I don’t know. I don’t know. He wrecked me earlier in the year at Vegas.
