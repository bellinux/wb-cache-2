500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out {{and went into}} a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

After a while, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> {{thinking}} that way, and it just seemed natural to do {{the opposite of what}} I had done before. [...] I like making music with other people. I can still make music by myself too.".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike many of The Cars' album covers, {{the cover}} for The Cars was {{designed}} by the record company, rather than drummer David Robinson. The cover was not well liked {{by the members of}} the band, however. Robinson said, [...] "I thought that when the Elektra came out it was way too slick. The pictures of us I didn't like." [...] Guitarist Elliot Easton expressed dislike for [...] "that big grinning face," [...] saying, [...] "Man, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> that cover." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in {{his senior}} year of high school, Fabolous began to pursue a career in hip hop music. He was invited to rap live on American record {{producer}} and music executive DJ Clue's radio show, then on New York City radio station Hot 97. DJ Clue subsequently signed Fabolous to his record label, Desert Storm Records. Fabolous was then featured on several DJ Clue mixtapes, as well as mixtapes with Roc-A-Fella artists. This earned Fabolous and Desert Storm a distribution deal with Elektra Records. In a September 6, 2001 interview with Hot104.com, Fabolous said he never planned on becoming a rapper and told the website: [...] "I was just trying to make some money, ya know? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being broke. This was something where I could make some money. It just happened for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rex told me {{that even}} in 1939 Wolfe was irked by the FBI's {{consuming}} curiosity about the private business of law-abiding citizens. In consequence, Wolfe felt under no constraint {{to tell the truth}} about himself when interrogated by Stahl. There was, however, another reason for Wolfe's contradictory statements about his place of origin. Rex explained: [...] "Editors and publishers are responsible for the discrepancy. … In the original draft of Over My Dead Body Nero was a Montenegrin by birth, and it all fitted previous hints as to his background; but violent protests from The American Magazine, supported by Farrar & Rinehart, caused his cradle to be transported five thousand miles. … <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> all the yapping, and besides it seemed highly improbable that anyone would give a damn, or even, for that matter, ever notice it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gutteridge did not {{particularly}} like {{being associated with}} the Dunedin Sound. He stated, [...] "People didn't think about the sound of things, people put on guitars and then clanged out stuff. <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> a guitar sound that wasn't thought about. I had my own personal style. I mean, I wrote Clean's Point That Thing Else' at 17." ...|$|R

[...] "I wasn’t doing horror movies when I was in Hollywood, I was just going out for TV and other auditions and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> so <b>I</b> gave it up; I focused on doing theatre and even sang in a band." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited {{personal}} {{reasons for his}} move. He {{was asked if he}} made the move because God had called him to proselytize and convert the Native Americans. To this Mullins responded, [...] "No. I think <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> a White, Evangelical, middle class perspective on God, and I thought I would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos.

500|$|<b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> {{making movies}} where all I did was {{walk across the}} screen and look pretty. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it.

6000|$|... "I so dislike {{people who}} do that," [...] said the Woman of the World. [...] "Emily never would speak to George; she would come and {{complain}} about him to me, as if I were responsible for him: I wasn't even his mother.

[...] I shook my head, and then he led the way out to the veranda, stopping to get his pipe and tobacco from the mantel on the way. But when we sat down in the early falling September twilight outside, he did not light his pipe, letting me smoke my cigarette alone.|$|R

5000|$|When {{asked by}} Blistering.com about what {{happened}} with his former band Motograter, Five Finger Death Punch's vocalist Ivan Moody said: [...] "Well it was a domino effect in Motograter {{and there were a}} lot of things that went wrong. Our manager and good friend Steve Richards passed away, then Elektra folded so our label collapsed and then there were a lot of politics involved. It just got to the point where we didn't enjoy what we were doing anymore. There was no love for the music and no love for being on stage with one another, so it just seemed like we were constantly battling one another for different things. We all took time off hoping that would help resolve the issues and then after a year went by <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> sitting on my ass." ...|$|R
