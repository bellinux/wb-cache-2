5|$|In 1855, {{entrepreneur}} James Mason Hutchings, artist Thomas Ayres and {{two others}} {{were the first to}} tour the area. Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, writing articles and special magazine <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> the Valley. Ayres' style in art was highly detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of the}} Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E

5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950. In the appeal they raised <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> the use of informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|The library {{houses the}} village's {{recreation}} department, which has four employees and a six-member advisory committee, and provides recreation programming for the village. This includes regular programs and special {{events at the}} pool, parks, and sports fields and courts. It <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> 1,400 pool permits annually and manages about 400 summer camp registrations each year. The department has operated the recreation center on Macy Road since 1980, and also runs a youth center on Van Lu Van Road. Its 2017–18 operating budget is $1,432,116.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E

5|$|Hinde was {{an active}} businessman, {{pursuing}} real estate, construction, and publishing opportunities in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. In his early years, Hinde publicly opposed slavery. He also used his newspaper, The Fredonian, in Chillicothe, Ohio between 1806 and 1808, to highlight <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> Indian treaties and the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. He served in the War of 1812. In later years he was {{a pioneer in the}} settlement of Indiana and Illinois, and the expansion of the Methodist Church in these areas. He contributed to the Madoc Tradition and was a noted historian and biographer. Hinde cofounded the Wabash Navigation Company, which engaged in real estate speculation and dam construction. The company dammed the Wabash River next to Hinde's property, creating the Grand Rapids Dam. The dam was abandoned by the Federal government in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the country into a full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

25|$|A Pew Research poll {{conducted}} August 14–17 among 1,000 adults, found stark racial and political divisions in {{reactions to the}} shooting. By about four-to-one, African Americans (80% to 18%) said the shooting raised important <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> race, while whites, by 47% to 37%, said {{the issue of race}} is getting more attention than it deserves. The divide in public opinion was also observed across partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats (including 62% of white Democrats) believing the incident raises important <b>issues</b> <b>about</b> race that merit discussion, compared with 40% of Independents and 22% of Republicans. Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to view the police response as appropriate (43%), compared with 21% of Democrats; 65% of Republicans expressed confidence in the investigations into the incident, compared with 38% of Democrats.|$|E
