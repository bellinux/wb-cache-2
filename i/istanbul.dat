5|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{cultural}} reemergence was {{the establishment of}} the <b>Istanbul</b> Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International <b>Istanbul</b> Film Festival and the <b>Istanbul</b> International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the <b>Istanbul</b> Festival has been known as the <b>Istanbul</b> International Music Festival since 1994. The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original <b>Istanbul</b> Festival is the <b>Istanbul</b> Biennial, held every two years since 1987. Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, the {{municipal}} boundaries of <b>Istanbul</b> have been coincident with {{the boundaries of}} its province. The city, considered capital of <b>Istanbul</b> Province, {{is administered by the}} <b>Istanbul</b> Metropolitan Municipality (MMI), which oversees the 39 districts of the city-province.|$|E
5|$|Between 2005 and 2011, <b>Istanbul</b> Park racing circuit {{hosted the}} annual Formula One Turkish Grand Prix. <b>Istanbul</b> Park {{was also a}} venue of the World Touring Car Championship and the European Le Mans Series in 2005 and 2006, but the track has not seen either of these {{competitions}} since then. It also hosted the Turkish Motorcycle Grand Prix between 2005 and 2007. <b>Istanbul</b> was occasionally a venue of the F1 Powerboat World Championship, with the last race on the Bosphorus strait on August 12–13, 2000. The last race of the Powerboat P1 World Championship on the Bosphorus took place on June 19–21, 2009. <b>Istanbul</b> Sailing Club, established in 1952, hosts races and other sailing events on the waterways in and around <b>Istanbul</b> each year. Turkish Offshore Racing Club also hosts major yacht races, such as the annual Naval Forces Trophy.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, <b>Istanbul</b> had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, <b>Istanbul</b> had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in <b>Istanbul</b> during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including <b>İstanbul</b> Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the <b>Istanbul</b> Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E
5|$|Ganguli {{founded and}} {{directed}} a major festival of cultural diplomacy and international arts in <b>Istanbul</b> in July 2010 {{under the title}} 'Istancool'. Liberatum claimed the festival's aim was to showcase all that is contemporary about <b>Istanbul</b> as a great world city while celebrating its past and heritage. Istancool brought together leading fashion, arts and cultural figures from Milan, London, Paris and New York City including Terence Koh, Daphne Guinness, Leigh Lezark, The Misshapes, Michael Nyman, Gareth Pugh, Gore Vidal, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Lily Cole, Zaha Hadid, Philip Treacy, Sir VS Naipaul, Franca Sozzani, Lee Daniels, Waris Ahluwalia and Jefferson Hack. The festival celebrated Istanbul's status as the 2010 European Capital of Culture. It aimed to showcase the great talents of Turkey and connect them with leading global figures. Istancool sponsors and partners consisted of Turkish Airlines, <b>Istanbul</b> 74, Vakko, Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, AnOther Magazine, Vogue Turkiye, Harper's Bazaar, <b>Istanbul</b> 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency, Sakip Sabanci Museum, Turkish Airlines, Pera Museum and <b>Istanbul</b> Modern.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, <b>Istanbul</b> was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, <b>Istanbul</b> underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of <b>Istanbul</b> began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of <b>Istanbul.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Istanbul</b> {{is home to}} Borsa <b>Istanbul,</b> {{the sole}} {{exchange}} entity of Turkey, which combined the former <b>Istanbul</b> Stock Exchange, the <b>Istanbul</b> Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former <b>Istanbul</b> Stock Exchange was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the <b>Istanbul</b> Stock Exchange (now Borsa <b>Istanbul)</b> moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the Sarıyer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataşehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.|$|E
5|$|Small {{settlements}} {{adjacent to}} major population centers in Turkey, including <b>Istanbul,</b> were merged into their respective primary cities {{during the early}} 1980s, resulting in metropolitan municipalities. The main decision-making body of the <b>Istanbul</b> Metropolitan Municipality is the Municipal Council, with members drawn from district councils.|$|E
5|$|TRT-Children is {{the only}} TRT {{television}} station based in <b>Istanbul.</b> <b>Istanbul</b> {{is home to the}} headquarters of several Turkish stations and regional headquarters of international media outlets. Istanbul-based Star TV was the first private television network to be established following the end of the TRT monopoly; Star TV and Show TV (also based in <b>Istanbul)</b> remain highly popular throughout the country, airing Turkish and American series. Kanal D and ATV are other stations in <b>Istanbul</b> that offer a mix of news and series; NTV (partnered with U.S. media outlet MSNBC) and Sky Turk—both based in the city—are mainly just known for their news coverage in Turkish. The BBC has a regional office in <b>Istanbul,</b> assisting its Turkish-language news operations, and the American news channel CNN established the Turkish-language CNN Türk there in 1999. The Istanbul-based business and entertainment channel CNBC-e began broadcasting in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Today, <b>Istanbul</b> hosts a {{wide variety}} of periodicals. Most {{nationwide}} newspapers are based in <b>Istanbul,</b> with simultaneous Ankara and İzmir editions. Hürriyet, Sabah, Posta and Sözcü, the country's top four papers, are all headquartered in <b>Istanbul,</b> boasting more than 275,000 weekly sales each. Hürriyets English-language edition, Hürriyet Daily News, has been printed since 1961, but the English-language Daily Sabah, first published by Sabah in 2014, has overtaken it in circulation. Several smaller newspapers, including popular publications like Habertürk and Milliyet, are also based in <b>Istanbul.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the <b>Istanbul</b> Metropolitan Municipality and <b>Istanbul</b> Province having {{equivalent}} jurisdictions, few responsibilities {{remain for}} the provincial government. Similar to the MMI, the <b>Istanbul</b> Special Provincial Administration has a governor, a democratically elected decision-making body—the Provincial Parliament—and an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring {{the executive committee}} at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament. The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, {{and the promotion of}} arts, culture, and nature conservation. Hüseyin Avni Mutlu has been Governor of <b>Istanbul</b> Province since May 2010.|$|E

5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by {{the authorities}} to {{have participated in the}} looting of an Istanbul-bound caravan from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in <b>Istanbul.</b> However, Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived safely in <b>Istanbul</b> and that the commander of the caravan, Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to <b>Istanbul.</b> About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Istanbul</b> University, {{founded in}} 1453, {{is the oldest}} Turkish {{educational}} institution in the city. Although originally an Islamic school, the university established law, medicine, and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after {{the founding of the}} Turkish Republic. <b>Istanbul</b> Technical University, founded in 1773, is the world's third-oldest university dedicated entirely to engineering sciences. These public universities are two of just eight across the city; other prominent state universities in <b>Istanbul</b> include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, which served as Turkey's primary institution of art until the 1970s, and Marmara University, the country's third-largest institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|<b>Istanbul</b> {{has some}} of Turkey's oldest sports clubs. Beşiktaş J.K., {{established}} in 1903, is considered the oldest of these sports clubs. Due to its initial status as Turkey's only club, Beşiktaş occasionally represented the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic in international sports competitions, earning the right to place the Turkish flag inside its team logo. Its football team has seen several periods of dominance in national competition. Galatasaray S.K. and Fenerbahçe S.K. have fared better in international competition and share the honor of winning the most Süper Lig championships: 20 and 19 times, respectively. Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe have a long-standing rivalry, with Galatasaray based in the European part and Fenerbahçe based in the Anatolian part of the city. <b>Istanbul</b> has seven basketball teams—Anadolu Efes, Beşiktaş, Darüşşafaka, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, <b>İstanbul</b> Büyükşehir Belediyespor and Büyükçekmece—that play in the premier-level Turkish Basketball Super League.|$|E

5|$|<b>Istanbul</b> {{has voted}} for the winning party in general {{elections}} since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The city's electorate has also {{voted for the}} AKP government's constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected Mayor of <b>İstanbul</b> in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as Bağcılar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. The opposition Kemalist center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), currently the second major political force in both <b>İstanbul</b> and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri, Çatalca and Sarıyer. Urban districts such as Beşiktaş, Bakırköy, Şişli and Kadıköy have returned {{strong support for the}} CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential developments are taking place. <b>İstanbul</b> has 39 districts, more than any other province in Turkey. Since <b>İstanbul</b> is Turkey's largest city and has usually voted {{in the same way as}} the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by İstanbul's electorate. Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the <b>İstanbul</b> Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral importance, <b>İstanbul</b> has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections, including the 2014 local elections.|$|E
5|$|<b>Istanbul</b> was {{historically}} {{known as}} a cultural hub, but its cultural scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward Ankara. The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions, especially those originating in Europe, but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital. Much of Turkey's cultural scene had its roots in <b>Istanbul,</b> and by the 1980s and 1990s <b>Istanbul</b> reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the church's history after its construction.

After being built over in the Ottoman period, {{the site of the}} church was rediscovered during excavations in the 1960s. The area, directly opposite the <b>Istanbul</b> Metropolitan Municipality City Hall, is now a preserved archaeological site open to visitors, although the sculptures have been removed to the <b>Istanbul</b> Archaeological Museum.|$|E
