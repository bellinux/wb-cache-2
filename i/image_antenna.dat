50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and antenna design, an <b>image</b> <b>antenna</b> is an electrical mirror-image of an antenna element {{formed by the}} radio waves reflecting from a conductive surface called a ground plane, such as {{the surface of the}} earth. It is used as a geometrical technique in calculating the radiation pattern of the antenna.|$|E
50|$|To form an <b>image</b> of the <b>antenna</b> above it, {{the ground}} plane {{need not be}} {{grounded}} to the Earth. Many antenna types, such as reflective array antennas, use flat surfaces of metal or metal screen to reflect radio waves from the antenna elements, and these can be analyzed using <b>image</b> <b>antennas.</b> If {{there is more than}} one reflective surface in the antenna, as in a corner reflector antenna, each surface forms its own <b>image</b> of the <b>antenna</b> elements. In order to form an image, the ground plane surface must generally have dimensions of at least a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves used.|$|R
50|$|The lander will {{communicate}} through X-band direct to Earth on cruise deck for transit; it will then use UHF <b>antenna.</b> <b>Imaging</b> and all data relaying would be coordinated with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter operations team.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these applications, many applications have been developed based on array processing techniques: Acoustic Beamforming for Hearing Aid Applications, Under-determined Blind Source Separation Using Acoustic Arrays, Digital 3D/4D Ultrasound <b>Imaging</b> Array, Smart <b>Antennas,</b> Synthetic aperture radar, underwater acoustic imaging, and Chemical sensor arrays...etc.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>image</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is used in}} calculating {{electric}} field vectors, magnetic field vectors, and electromagnetic fields emanating from the real antenna, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} the antenna and along the ground. Each charge and current in the real antenna has its counterpart in the image, and may also be considered as a source of radiation.|$|E
50|$|When a radio antenna {{is mounted}} above a {{conductive}} surface {{such as the}} earth, the radio waves directed down toward the surface reflect off it. The radiation received at a distant point {{is the sum of}} two contributions: the waves that travel directly from the antenna to the point, and the waves that reach the point after reflecting off the ground plane. Because of the reflection, these second waves appear to come from a second antenna behind the plane, just as a visible object in front of a flat mirror forms a virtual image that seems to lie behind the mirror. The radiation pattern of the antenna is exactly the same as it would be if the ground plane were replaced by a mirror image of the antenna, located an equal distance behind the plane. This second apparent source of radio waves is the <b>image</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{monopole}} can be visualized (right) {{as being}} formed by replacing {{the bottom half}} of a vertical dipole antenna (c) with a conducting plane (ground plane) at right-angles to the remaining half. If the ground plane is large enough, the radio waves from the remaining upper half of the dipole (a) reflected from the ground plane will seem to come from an <b>image</b> <b>antenna</b> (b) forming the missing half of the dipole, which adds to the direct radiation to form a dipole radiation pattern. So the pattern of a monopole with a perfectly conducting, infinite ground plane is identical to the top half of a dipole pattern, with its maximum radiation in the horizontal direction, perpendicular to the antenna. Because it radiates only into the space above the ground plane, or half the space of a dipole antenna, a monopole antenna will have a gain of twice (3 dB greater than) the gain of a similar dipole antenna, and a radiation resistance half that of a dipole. Since a half-wave dipole has a gain of 2.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of 73 ohms, a quarter-wave monopole, the most common type, will have a gain of 2.19 + 3 = 5.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of about 36.8 ohms if it is mounted above a good ground plane.|$|E
50|$|The first flat lens used a thin wafer {{of silicon}} 60 {{nanometers}} thick coated with concentric rings of v-shaped gold nanoantennas to produce photographic <b>images.</b> The <b>antennas</b> were systematically arranged on the silicon wafer and refract the light {{so that it}} all ends up on a single focal plane, a so-called artificial refraction process. The antennas were surrounded by an opaque silver/titanium mask that reflected all light that did not strike the antennas. Varying the arm lengths and angle provided the required range of amplitudes and phases. The distribution of the rings controls focal length.|$|R
5000|$|This {{means that}} a {{receiving}} antenna [...] "sees" [...] an <b>image</b> of the <b>antenna</b> but with reversed currents.

40|$|Using UWB {{hyperthermia}} {{systems has}} the potential to improve the heat delivery to deep seated tumours. In this paper, we present a novel self-grounded Bow–Tie antenna design which is to serve as the basis element in a phased-array applicator. The UWB operation in the frequency range of 0. 43 – 1 GHz is achieved by immersing the antenna in a water bolus. The radiation characteristics are improved by appropriate shaping the water bolus and by inclusion of dielectric layers {{on the top of the}} radiating arms of the antenna. In order to find the most appropriate design, we use a combination of performance indicators representing the most important attributes of the antenna. These are the UWB impedance matching, the transmission capability and the effective field size. The antenna was constructed and experimentally validated on muscle-like phantom. The measured reflection and transmission coefficients as well as radiation characteristics are in excellent agreement with the simulated results.

50|$|The net {{quality of}} a ground {{reflection}} depends on the topography of the surface. When the irregularities of the surface are {{much smaller than the}} wavelength, the dominant regime is that of specular reflection, and the receiver sees both the real <b>antenna</b> and an <b>image</b> of the <b>antenna</b> under the ground due to reflection. But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases. With shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), this is generally the case.|$|R
40|$|We use WIRC, IR <b>images</b> of the <b>Antennae</b> (NGC 4038 / 4039) {{together}} with the extensive catalogue of 120 X-ray point sources (Zezas et al. 2006) to search for counterpart candidates. Using our proven frame-tie technique, we find 38 X-ray sources with IR counterparts, almost doubling the number of IR counterparts to X-ray sources first identified in Clark et al. (2007). In our photometric analysis, we consider the 35 IR counterparts that are confirmed star clusters. We show that the clusters with X-ray sources tend to be brighter, K_s ~ 16 mag, with (J-K_s) = 1. 1 mag. We then use archival HST <b>images</b> of the <b>Antennae</b> to search for optical counterparts to the X-ray point sources. We employ our previous IR-to-X-ray frame-tie as an intermediary to establish a precise optical-to-X-ray frame-tie with < 0. 6 arcsec rms positional uncertainty. Due to the high optical source density near the X-ray sources, we determine that we cannot reliably identify counterparts. Comparing the HST positions to the 35 identified IR star cluster counterparts, we find optical matches for 27 of these sources. Using Bruzual-Charlot spectral evolutionary models, we find that most clusters associated with an X-ray source are massive, ~ 10 ^ 6 M_sun, young, ~ 10 ^ 6 yr, with moderate metallicities, Z= 0. 05.

During {{the last several years}} there has been substantial progress in multirate system research. This includes design of decimation and interpolation filters, analysis/synthesis filter banks (also called quadrature mirror filters, or QMFJ, and the development of new sampling theorems. First, the basic concepts and building blocks in multirate digital signal processing (DSPJ, including the digital polyphase representation, are reviewed. Next, recent progress as reported by several authors in this area is discussed. Several appli-cations are described, including the following: subband coding of waveforms, voice privacy systems, integral and fractional sampling rate conversion (such as in digital audio), digital crossover net-works, and multirate coding of narrow-band filter coefficients. The M-band QMF bank is discussed in considerable detail, including an analysis of various errors and imperfections. Recent techniques for perfect signal reconstruction in such systems are reviewed. The connection between QMF banks and other related topics, such as block digital filtering and periodically time-varying systems, based on a pseudo-circulant matrix framework, is covered.

5000|$|The {{radio waves}} from an antenna element that reflect off a ground plane appear {{to come from}} a mirror <b>image</b> of the <b>antenna</b> located {{on the other side of}} the ground plane.

So a monopole mounted over an ideal ground plane has a radiation pattern identical to a dipole antenna. The feedline from the transmitter or receiver is connected between the bottom end of the monopole element and the ground plane. The ground plane must have good conductivity; any resistance in the ground plane is in series with the antenna, and serves to dissipate power from the transmitter.|$|R

An L-band (1. 4 GHz) synthetic aperture radiometer, dubbed the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer, is tested and calibrated. The instrument is modeled after radio telescopes, and utilizes a thinned array of correlation interferometers to measure the Fourier Transform of the Brightness temperature <b>image.</b> The <b>antenna</b> hardware of such an array is reduced by comparison with real aperture antenna systems, which renders this technique relevant to future spaceborne remote sensing applications that require high resolution. In particular, it is the scientific applications at L-band, including the spaceborne remote sensing of soil moisture and ocean salinity, which have motivated this research. ^ Aperture synthesis concepts are developed and applied to the theoretical ESTAR system in chapter II. Chapter II also includes a description of the prototype which was designed constructed at the University of Massachusetts. Practical calibration algorithms are developed in chapter III, and the synthesis technique is refined in chapter IV to reduce side lobes.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} a multimode antenna combined with time-interleaved acquisition of modes (TIAMO) for improved 1 H image homogeneity as compared to conventional traveling-wave imaging in the human brain at 9. 4 Tesla (T). Methods: An adjustable three-port antenna was built to stimulate the propagation of three basic waveguide modes within a 9. 4 [*]T scanner bore. For TIAMO, two time-interleaved acquisitions using different linear combinations of these modes were optimized to achieve a homogeneous rooted sum-of-squares combination of their inline image patterns (inline <b>image).</b> The <b>antenna's</b> transmit and receive performance, as well as local specific absorption rate, were analyzed using experiments and numerical simulations. Results: The optimized TIAMO inline image combination was superior to radiofrequency shimming. Across the entire brain, it improved the homogeneity of the excitation field by a factor of two and its maximum-to-minimum ratio by almost a factor of five as compared to the circularly polarized mode. The two-fold increase in “virtual” receive channels enhanced the parallel imaging performance and enabled the use of higher acceleration factors. Conclusion: Despite the limited number of channels, a remote three-port antenna combined with TIAMO represents an easily implementable setup to achieve void-free 1 H images from the entire brain at 9. 4 [*]T, which can be used for anatomical localization and B 0 shimming...|$|R

40|$|In practice, a {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) reconstructs the complex reflectivity function of a scene, modulated by phase terms that capture 3 -D imaging geometry. INSAR (interferometric SAR) attempts to obtain the geometric information by interfering two <b>images</b> (from two <b>antennas)</b> to cancel the same scene reflectivity and recover the scene topography transduced by the image-phase data.

The phase-unwrapping problem can be solved in a pointwise fashion by using more than two antennas. This approach can e#ectively prevent error propagation which occurs in traditional phase-unwrapping algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. We compare {{mid-infrared}} <b>images</b> of the <b>Antennae</b> galaxies (NGC 4038 / 39) {{from the}} Infrared Space Observatory, with optical {{images from the}} Hubble Space Telescope. The midinfrared observations show that the most intense starburst in this colliding system of galaxies takes place in an off-nucleus region that is inconspicuous at optical wavelengths. The analyses of the mid-infrared spectra indicate that the most massive stars are being formed in an optically obscured knot of 50 pc radius, which produces about 15 % of the total luminosity from the Antennae galaxies between 12. 5 µm and 18 µm. The mid-infrared observations reported here demonstrate that the interpretation of star formation properties in colliding/merging systems based on visible wavelengths alone can be profoundly biased due to dust obscuration. The multiwavelength view of this nearby prototype merging system suggests caution in deriving scenarios of early evolution of high redshift galaxies using only observations in the narrow rest-frame ultraviolet wavelength range...|$|R
