The 86 mm bore size worked well with the four-valves per cylinder layout, while the 68 mm stroke allowed a long conrod that helps to minimise secondary vibration, although Triumph engineers also altered the bar weights to restore a little 'character' vibration. Designer David Stride was able to add details that retained {{the look of the}} original, such as a <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder</b> and dummy pushrod tube (which functions as a cylinder head oil breather) and internal oil lines to create a clean appearance. As well as the desired low and midrange performance, the engine is capable of 115 mph and produces a respectable peak power output of [...] @ 7400 rpm, with maximum torque of [...] @ 3500 rpm, with 90% of the engine's torque output available from 2750 rpm {{all the way to the}} rev limit. The engine was air-cooled like the original, but had twin overhead camshafts instead of the old model's pushrod valve operation. A frame mounted oil cooler ensured consistent running temperatures and camshaft drive is by chain between the cylinders and incorporates an idler gear that allowed the cylinder head to be kept very compact.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Experimental {{studies of}} the local flow and heat {{transfer}} characteristics within the finned region of a cowled, annularly <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder</b> are presented. The temperature and local heat fluxes across fin surfaces were measured using thermocouples and Micro-foil ™ heat flux sensors. Areas of maximum heat transfer coefficients greater than 60 W/m 2 K were observed in the forward fin tip and base regions. A local minimum of 12 W/m 2 K {{was found in the}} mid-fin regions behind the <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The local flow characteristics within the finned region were measured using laser Doppler anemometry at an inlet Reynolds number of 4 × 105.

Correlation between the heat transfer and flow characteristics confirm the existence of boundary layer development, forward edge separation, and root and tip vortices.

The available data for heat transfer to air in straight ducts of rectangular and circular cross section have been correlated in plots of Stanton number versus Reynolds number {{to provide a}} background {{for the study of}} the data for finned cylinders. Equations are recommended for both the streamlined and turbulent regions, and data are presented for the transition region between turbulent and laminar flow. Use of hexagonal ends on round tubes causes the characteristics of laminar flow to extend to high Reynolds numbers. Average coefficients for the entire <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder</b> have been calculated from the average temperature at the base of the fins and an equation which was derived to allow for the effectiveness of the fins. The available results for each <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder</b> are correlated herein in terms of graphs of Stanton number versus Reynolds number. In general, for a given Reynolds number, the Stanton number increases with increases in both spacing and width of the fins, and is apparently independent of cylinder diameter and temperature difference.

40|$|International audienceThe present {{experimental}} investigation {{relates to}} the convective heat transfer determination around annular fins mounted on a rotating cylinder with air crossflow. The mean convective heat transfer coefficient can be identified by solving the inverse conduction heat transfer problem during the fin cooling process.

50|$|The Type 98 Vagabond was Vickers' entry. It was a single-bay, wire-braced biplane {{with wings}} of {{constant}} chord except towards the rounded trailing tips.

40|$|<b>Finned</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{commonly}} {{encountered in the}} design of heat exchangers. Critical to the design and performance of a heat exchanger are the mean and fluctuating loading on the tubes, as they relate to pressure losses across the model and may lead to structural vibrations. The loading characteristics are related to the vortex shedding phenomena in the wakes of finned tubes, which motivates the need to understand their relationship in detail. The flow development and structural loading characteristics of cylinders with equispaced circular fins were studied experimentally in the University of Waterloo water flume facility. <b>Finned</b> <b>cylinders</b> of diameter ratio Df/D = 2. 0, fin thickness ratio t/D = 0. 028 and range of fin pitch ratios 0. 083 ≤ c/D ≤ 1. 0 were investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and force balance measurements. The Reynolds number ranged from ReDeff = 1020 - 2040 based on the effective diameter of the models, corresponding to the shear layer transition turbulent shedding regime. For c/D = 1. 0, the vortex development resembles that of a uniform base cylinder, besides a region of affected flow near each fin. Further reduction of c/D results in similar scales of vortex formation, but with increased unsteady flapping of the separated shear layers. Following that, for c/D ≤ 0. 083, boundary layer coalescence between the fins leads to the flow redirection and separation at the fin diameter. The generation of lateral vorticity between the fins leads to the progressive weakening of the spanwise shear layers with decreasing c/D. However, the bleeding of low-energy fluid into the near wake from the viscous regions between the fins has a stabilizing effect on the mixing of vorticity during vortex formation, thereby augmenting the structure of turbulence in the wake and inducing stronger wake vortex shedding. Linear increases in the mean drag with increasing fin density are attributed to the independent viscous shear contributions introduced by each finned surface, and the fall off of the linear trend with high fin density is due to the loss of this independence with lateral boundary layer coalescence. The RMS of the fluctuating lift is shown to increase initially for decreasing c/D → 0. 33, as the wake vortices increase in strength and flow unsteadiness increases near the cylinder surface. However, the fluctuating lift is severely diminished for low c/D = 0. 083, with vortex formation displaced much further downstream, despite exhibiting stronger wake vortices. The vortex shedding frequency is shown to decrease with decreasing c/D. A modification of the definition of the Strouhal number based on the cylinders effective diameter is proposed which incorporates Reynolds numbers effects associated with the differences in the added flow blockage created by the boundary layers developing on the fin surfaces. This definition is found to universally collapse the shedding frequency data in the study and literature onto a constant StDeff* ≈ 0. 2 with little scatter...|$|R

The application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to the PIV velocity fields of the two cylinder types is also discussed.

40|$|Because of {{its high}} energy density, {{hydrogen}} is a desirable energy source for the achievement of a renewable energy landscape. Though production methods like thermolysis, electrolysis and biomass conversion, among others, {{are thought to be}} long term renewable solutions, catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR) is currently the predominant mechanism to produce hydrogen on an industrial scale. The highly endothermic, transport-limited reforming process has also been scaled down through process intensification to create efficient small-scale hydrogen-generating systems. One proposed geometry utilizes a catalytic <b>finned</b> <b>cylinder</b> that provides a manufacturable solution to enable high-efficiency heat exchange and SMR reaction. An accurate representation of the reactor performance characteristics is imperative to the design of small-scale systems. The Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, the respective dimensionless temperature and concentration gradients, are commonly used to model the transport characteristics. Previous works have outlined the significance of modeling techniques that include radial diffusion to capture the bulk-phase diffusive resistance. However, prior studies have either over-simplified the transport to neglect diffusion in the bulk fluid or employed CFD to include the relevant effects. A considerable limitation of CFD-derived solutions is a high degree of computational intensity. In the current study, local transport coefficients are determined for the SMR reaction in a catalytic microchannel. The 2 -D cylindrical transport equations are simplified based on approximations from prior work to represent the channel geometry. The applied assumptions dramatically decrease the model 2 ̆ 7 s computation time. A finite central-differencing scheme is implemented to solve the coupled transport equations with the reaction kinetics, and is solved through simultaneous matrix inversion. A kinetic model for SMR reactions is included as a model subroutine to describe the highly non-linear transport/kinetic interactions, while accounting for species adsorption/desorption to and from the catalyst. The transport model is compared to known solutions for the desired boundary conditions to validate the diffusive effects.
