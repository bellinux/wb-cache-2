500|$|Garfield's biographers {{were unwilling}} to {{exonerate}} him in Crédit Mobilier, with Allan Peskin writing, [...] "Did Garfield lie? Not <b>exactly.</b> <b>Did</b> he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement... influenced his behavior." [...] Rutkow wrote that [...] "Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock {{and that he had}} also received a dividend of $329." [...] Caldwell suggested that Garfield [...] "...while he told the truth , certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty." [...] That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, [...] "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} Christian era, there was {{considerable}} disagreement amongst Christians regarding the nature of Christ's Incarnation. [...] While all Christians believed that Jesus was indeed the Son of God, {{the exact nature of}} his Sonship was contested, together with the precise relationship of the [...] "Father," [...] "Son" [...] and [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] referred to in the New Testament. [...] Though Jesus was clearly the [...] "Son," [...] what <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> this mean? Debate on this subject raged most especially during the first four centuries of Christianity, involving Jewish Christians, Gnostics, followers of the Presbyter Arius of Alexandra, and adherents of St. Athanasius the Great, among others.|$|E

We thought of the characters in the unconvincing wigs and costumes of our school performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as yet to touch these things to life again.

6000|$|Lord Beaumaris was a {{very young}} man, handsome, {{extremely}} shy, and one who had only very recently mixed with the circle {{in which he was}} born. It was under the influence of Imogene that, in soliciting an interview with Lord Montfort, he had taken for him an unusual, not to say unprecedented step. He had conjured up to himself in Lord Montfort the apparition of a haughty Whig peer, proud of his order, prouder of his party, and not over-prejudiced in favour of one who had quitted those sacred ranks, freezing with arrogant reserve and condescending politeness. In short, Lord Beaumaris was extremely nervous when, ushered by many servants through many chambers, there came forward to receive him the most sweetly mannered gentleman alive, who not only gave him his hand, but retained his guest's, saying, [...] "We are a sort of cousins, I believe, and ought to have been acquainted before, but you know perhaps my wretched state," [...] though what that was nobody <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> know, particularly as Lord Montfort was sometimes seen wading in streams breast-high while throwing his skilful line over the rushing waters. [...] "I remember your grandfather," [...] he said, [...] "and with good cause. He pouched me at Harrow, and it was the largest pouch I ever had. One does not forget the first time one had a five-pound note." ...|$|E
6000|$|What the {{question}} seems thus {{to come to}} would be a consuming curiosity as to any cited old case of the spell in the very interest of one's catching it comparatively [...] "out"; in the interest positively of the likelihood of one's doing so, and this {{in the face of}} so many great testifying portraits. My private perversity, as I here glance at it, has had its difficulties--most of all possibly that of one's addiction, in growing older, to allowing a supreme force to one's earlier, even one's earliest, estimates of physical felicity; or in other words that of the felt impulse to leave the palm for good looks to those who have reached out to it through the medium of our own history. If the conditions grow better for them why then should we have almost the habit of thinking better of our handsome folk dead than of our living?--and even to the very point of not resenting on the part of others similarly affected the wail of wonder as to what has strangely [...] "become" [...] of the happy types d'antan. I dodge that inquiry just now--we may meet it again; noting simply the fact that [...] "old" [...] pretenders to the particular crown I speak of--and in the sense especially of the pretension made rather for than by them--offered to my eyes a greater interest than the new, whom I was ready enough to take for granted, as one for the most part easily could; belonging as it <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> on the other hand to the interest of their elders that this couldn't be so taken. That was just the attraction of the latter claim--that the grounds of it had to be made out, puzzled out verily on occasion, but that when they were recognised they had a force all their own. One would have liked to be able to clear the distinction between the new and the old of all ambiguity--explain, that is, how little the superficially invidious term was sometimes noted as having in common with the elderly: so much was it a clear light held up to {{the question}} that truly beautiful persons might be old without being elderly. Their juniors couldn't be new, unfortunately, without being youthful--unfortunately because the fact of youth, so far from dispelling ambiguity, positively introduced it. One made up one's mind thus that the only sure specimens were, and had to be, those acquainted with time, and with whom time, on its side, was acquainted; those in fine who had borne the test and still looked at it face to face. These were of one's own period of course--one looked at them face to, face; one blessedly hadn't to consider them by hearsay or to refer to any portrait of them for proof: indeed in presence of the resisting, the gained, cases one found one's self practically averse to old facts or old traditions of portraiture, accompanied by no matter what names.|$|E
