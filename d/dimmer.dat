5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, <b>dimmer</b> companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the <b>dimmer</b> star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a <b>dimmer</b> companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the <b>dimmer</b> companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E

50|$|If V, W, X are finite-dimensional, then so is L(V, W; X). For X = F, i.e. {{bilinear}} forms, {{the dimension}} of this space is <b>dim</b> V × <b>dim</b> W (while the space L(V × W; F) of linear forms is of dimension <b>dim</b> V + <b>dim</b> W). To see this, choose a basis for V and W; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix B(ei, fj), and vice versa. Now, if X is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have <b>dim</b> L(V, W; X) = <b>dim</b> V × <b>dim</b> W × <b>dim</b> X.|$|R
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is not visible to the naked eye. It is slightly <b>dimmer</b> than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe.

The power factor, energy efficiency, electronic loss, lux/Watt and crest factor of 2 × 36 W electronic ballasts {{based on these}} two <b>dimming</b> methods are recorded and compared over a wide <b>dimming</b> range. It is found that the voltage <b>dimming</b> control approach {{is much better than}} the frequency control method in most of the compared aspects as the lamp is <b>dimmed.</b> In particular, voltage <b>dimming</b> approach has much higher energy efficiency and lux per watt than the frequency control one.

5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a <b>dimmer</b> and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous. The Sun's {{temperature}} is intermediate between {{that of the}} hottest stars {{and that of the}} coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially <b>dimmer</b> and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} star is a dense {{white dwarf}} star.

40|$|We report {{observations}} of a two-stage coronal <b>dimming</b> in an eruptive {{event of a}} two-ribbon flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME). Weak gradual <b>dimming</b> persists {{for more than half}} an hour before the onset of the two-ribbon flare and the fast rise of the CME. It is followed by abrupt rapid <b>dimming.</b> The two-stage <b>dimming</b> occurs in a pair of conjugate <b>dimming</b> regions adjacent to the two flare ribbons, and the flare onset marks the transition between the two stages of <b>dimming.</b> At the onset of the two-ribbon flare, transient brightenings are also observed inside the <b>dimming</b> regions, before rapid <b>dimming</b> occurs at the same places. These observations suggest that the CME structure, most probably anchored at the twin <b>dimming</b> regions, undergoes a slow rise before the flare onset, and its kinematic evolution has significantly changed at the onset of flare reconnection.

5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing <b>dimmer</b> and <b>dimmer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars <b>dimmer</b> than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
40|$|Deep Hα {{images of}} a sample of nearby late-type spiral galaxies have been {{analyzed}} to characterize the morphology and energetic significance of the "Diffuse Ionized Medium" (<b>DIM).</b> We find that the <b>DIM</b> properties can be reasonably unified {{as a function of}} relative surface brightness, by using a new method to quantify the <b>DIM</b> importance in galaxies. This new approach is more consistent with the fundamentally morphological definition of the <b>DIM</b> as being `Diffuse', compared to the traditional way adopted in previous studies that could only isolate the <b>DIM</b> based on an absolute surface brightness criterion. Our results suggest that the variation of the <b>DIM's</b> significance among the galaxies is small enough so that the fractional contribution of the <b>DIM</b> to the global Hα luminosity in the galaxies is fairly constant, as has been observed. We found a smooth structural transition from HII regions to the <b>DIM,</b> suggesting that the ionizing energy for the <b>DIM</b> mainly comes from HII regions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) LED driver with precise <b>dimming</b> and full <b>dimming</b> range.

It has the flexibility of using either phase-shift or synchronous pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) switching for <b>dimming</b> control.

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are <b>dimmer</b> and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much <b>dimmer,</b> because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity.

5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} {{enough that they}} could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were farther away from Jupiter.

They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude <b>dimmer</b> when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
