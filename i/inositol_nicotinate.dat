5000|$|<b>Inositol</b> <b>Nicotinate</b> {{is given}} the term Inositol hexaniacinate, as well as [...] "No-Flush Niacin". [...] "Flushing", in physiology, is a broad term that {{essentially}} means that epidermal tissues have become reddened, such as when the skin is irritated from the histamine responses related to an allergic reaction, or from recent physical exercise, or even from anger or embarrassment. The reaction has been related to well over 200 causes. This form of niacin is supposed to reduce or prevent flushing by being broken down into the metabolites Niacin (aka Nicotinic acid) and Inositol at a slower rate.|$|E
40|$|The vaso-active {{effects of}} <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (HexopalÂ®) were {{investigated}} in thirty patients with {{primary and secondary}} Raynaud's phenomenon using several non-invasive experimental techniques under controlled conditions. The earlier formed impression that this drug requires a prolonged 'build-up' period was confirmed. Recording {{the time required to}} induce Raynaud's phenomenon as well as assessments of total and nutrient digital bloodflow showed significant beneficial therapeutic effects upon the skin's micro-circulation by <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate.</b> This study suggests that the therapeutic effect of this drug is not merely due to vasodilation but that other mechanisms such as enhancedfibrinolysis and lowering ofserum lipids may playa significantpart in its overalleffect. Smokers responded slower than non-smokers, but even elderly patients with longstanding vasospastic disease showed measurably improved digital circulation. Unlike some other drugs in this field <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> was found to be effective orally and to be devoid of unwanted side-effects. However, in the majority of patients it failed to abolish their increased vascular spasm although it diminished it significantly in most. It appears to be a safe and well tolerated drug, which, together with other symptomatic measures, merits {{to be used in the}} management ofvasospastic disease of the extremities even in the presence of partial obliteration of the micro-circulation...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This {{systematic}} review aims {{to evaluate the}} benefit and side effect of Xuezhikang for coronary heart disease (CHD) complicated by dyslipidemia. Methods. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with Xuezhikang {{as a treatment for}} CHD combined with dyslipidemia were considered for inclusion. Data extraction and analyses and quality assessment were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. We included 22 randomized trials. Xuezhikang showed significant benefit on the incidence of all-cause deaths, CHD deaths, myocardial infarction, and revascularization as compared with placebo based on conventional treatment for CHD. It remarkably lowered total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as compared with the placebo or <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> group, which was similar to statins group. Xuezhikang also raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to placebo or no intervention, which was similar to <b>Inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> and slightly inferior to statins. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the Xuezhikang and control group. Conclusions. Xuezhikang showed a comprehensive lipid-regulating effect and was safe and effective in reducing cardiovascular events in CHD patients complicated by dyslipidemia. However, more rigorous trials with high quality are needed to give high level of evidence...|$|E
40|$|Protective {{effects of}} {{clinically}} used drugs against adriamycin (ADM) -induced toxicity were studied in ICR mice. The control mice, which were administered 15 mg/kg of ADM twice, survived 7. 48 +/- 1. 99 days (mean +/- S. D.). The survival times of mice {{treated with the}} following drugs, expressed {{as a percent of}} that of the control group, were 293. 6 % for coenzyme Q 10 (Co Q 10, 2 mg/kg), 402. 2 % for dextran sulfate (MDS, 300 mg/kg), 121. 6 % for flavin adenine dinucleotide (20 mg/kg), 236. 3 % for adenosine triphosphate disodium (50 mg/kg), 213. 7 % for reduced glutathione (100 mg/kg), 121. 6 % for phytonadione (50 mg/kg), 155. 2 % for <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (Ino-N, 500 mg/kg), 335. 5 % for nicomol (1000 mg/kg), 157. 5 % for nicardipine (10 mg/kg) and 123. 3 % for dipyridamol (50 mg/kg). Anti-hyperlipemic agents such as MDS, nicomol, Ino-N and Co Q 10 strongly protected against the ADM-induced toxicity, and the mice administered these drugs lived significantly longer than the control mice. The mechanism of the protective effect was discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of therapies for improving functional outcomes in individuals with intermittent claudication due to lower-limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods: Literature review. Results: Treatment approaches that aim to improve functional outcomes (and walking performance specifically) in individuals with intermittent claudication include exercise training, lower-limb revascularization, and prescription of various drugs, including peripheral vasodilators. Supervised exercise training, particularly that which involves walking as the main exercise modality, is an effective treatment for improving walking performance in individuals with intermittent claudication; however, few supervised exercise programs exist specifically for these patients, limiting access to this therapy. Consequently, most patients with intermittent claudication do not participate in supervised exercise. The evidence for the effectiveness of unsupervised exercise programs is currently weak and mixed, and lack of motivation and pain have been cited as major barriers to participation in self-managed exercise. Lower-limb revascularization procedures (angioplasty or bypass surgery) can improve walking performance; however, such procedures are not feasible for some patients (eg, in the case of extensive multi-segmental disease) and are invasive and expensive. Medications used to treat PAD-related functional impairment (eg, cilostazol, pentoxifylline, <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> and naftidrofuryl oxalate [not approved in the US]) all have limited efficacy. Conclusion: Supervised walking exercise is a cheap and effective approach for improving walking performance in individuals with intermittent claudication. Therefore, efforts should be made to provide patients with access to a supervised exercise program, or to promote self-managed walking when supervised exercise is not available or practical...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} bifendate on serum and hepatic lipids level in rabbits and mice. Methods: Animals were administered bifendate [powdered pill suspended in 0. 5 % sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) ] at increasing doses (0. 25 - 1 g/kg, ig). Blood lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured using commercially available assay kits. Results: The treatment of rabbits with a single dose of bifendate (0. 3 g/kg) caused a time-dependent and biphasic change in serum triglyceride (TG) levels, with the value reaching a maximum (3 -fold increase compared to the baseline value) between 24 and 36 h post-dosing. When mice were orally treated with bifendate (0. 25 - 1 g/kg), serum TG levels increased by 39 %- 76 % and 14 %- 39 % at 24 and 48 h post-dosing, respectively. When given at daily doses of 0. 25 and 1 g/kg for 4 d, bifendate increased serum TG levels (56 %- 79 %), with concomitant elevations in apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B levels at 24 h after the last dosing. TG levels were also increased (11 %- 43 %) in liver samples of mice receiving single or multiple doses of bifendate. However, bifendate treatment caused slight reductions in serum and hepatic total cholesterol levels (9 %- 13 %). The hypertriglyceridemia induced by bifendate was ameliorated by fenofibrate but not <b>inositol</b> <b>nicotinate</b> treatment in mice. Conclusion: The findings suggest that bifendate treatment at high oral doses can cause an acute elevation in serum and hepatic TG levels...|$|E
