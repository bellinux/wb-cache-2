50|$|<b>Dotarizine</b> {{is a drug}} used in the {{treatment}} of migraine, which acts as a calcium channel blocker, and also as an antagonist at the 5HT2A receptor, {{and to a lesser extent}} at the 5HT1A and 5HT2C receptors. The anti-migraine action is thought to be due to its action as a vasodilator, but it also has some anxiolytic effects and blocks amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock in animals.|$|E
40|$|The novel antimigraineur, <b>dotarizine</b> (30 [*]μM), {{increased}} cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, [Ca 2 +]c, in fura- 2 -loaded bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. This {{increase was}} transient, reached a peak in about 2 – 5 [*]min (0. 53 ± 0. 07 [*]μM; n= 19) and then declined to basal levels over a further 5 [*]min period. This transient rise of [Ca 2 +]c was mimicked by 1 [*]μM thapsigargin and by 30 [*]μM cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), {{but not by}} 30 [*]μM flunarizine. Both thapsigargin and CPA occluded the effects of <b>dotarizine</b> and vice versa. All three compounds suppressed the transient [Ca 2 +]c rises induced by caffeine (10 [*]mM, 10 [*]s); blockade induced by thapsigargin was irreversible and that induced by CPA and <b>dotarizine</b> was reversible. Of the three compounds, only <b>dotarizine</b> blocked reversibly the [Ca 2 +]c spikes induced by short pulses of high K+ (70 [*]mM, 5 [*]s), suggesting that <b>dotarizine</b> blocks voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels but CPA and thapsigargin do not. <b>Dotarizine</b> caused a gradual and reversible depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2 + in chromaffin cells transfected with ER-targeted aequorin. CPA had a similar effect. These data show that <b>dotarizine</b> shares with thapsigargin and CPA the ability to deplete Ca 2 + in the ER; this novel action of <b>dotarizine</b> could be relevant to its prophylactic effects in migraine. Unlike thapsigargin and CPA, however, <b>dotarizine</b> additionally and reversibly blocks Ca 2 + entry through voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels...|$|E
