25|$|In {{post-disaster}} reactions, formal benefit {{societies of}} our time often lend aid to others outside their immediate membership, while ad hoc benefit associations form among neighbors or refugees, generally lasting {{only as long as}} the emergency exists. Ad hoc mutual aid associations have been seen organized among strangers facing shared challenges in such disparate settings as the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival in New York in 1969, during the Beijing Tiananmen square protests of 1989, <b>for</b> <b>neighborhood</b> defense during the Los Angeles Riots of 1992, and work of the organization Common Ground Collective which formed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

25|$|The Union-Miles Community Coalition {{had taken}} on an {{increasing}} number of tasks since its formation. Initially, it pressed the city to provide improved basic services, and to tear down abandoned, decrepit, or vandalized housing. It formed neighborhood watch programs and safety patrols, and it pushed local banks to establish branches in the neighborhood and provide more lending in the area. To enable it to take on increasingly complex problems requiring full-time staff and public and private financing, the coalition formed the nonprofit Union Miles Development Corporation (UMDC) on May 1, 1981. Working with the Center <b>for</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> Development, UMDC won passage of a new state law allowing nonprofit community development corporations to act as receivers for abandoned housing. UMDC also established the Cleveland Housing Receivership Project, which acted as a clearinghouse and advisory body to member neighborhood housing groups interested in using receivership to improve their Cleveland neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan.

This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association <b>for</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra money to make up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies should have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E

500|$|Membership {{peaked at}} 1,336 in 1952 but {{subsequently}} {{declined in the}} late 1950s {{as much of the}} city's population migrated to the suburbs. In response, a portion of the congregation decided in 1956 to build a church in the suburban Woodbrook area north of Baltimore. Other members wished to remain at the Bolton Hill location, prompting a decision to operate one church at two locations, with a shared ministerial staff. In the early 1970s, the church began a tutoring program <b>for</b> <b>neighborhood</b> children and a [...] "Meals on Wheels" [...] service under then-ministers Iain Wilson, pastor, and Clinton C.

2500|$|Muni {{experienced}} a diesel bus availability crisis in 1981-2 {{when most of}} their diesel buses, 401 GMC and Flxible [...] "New Looks" [...] purchases in 1969, {{reached the end of}} their 12-year design life and funds for their replacement were not available. Most {{of the rest of the}} fleet were undersized 36-foot AM Generals purchased <b>for</b> <b>neighborhood</b> routes, and their use on heavier lines exacerbated conditions. The trolley bus fleet was in good order and had excess capacity at the time so Muni improvised a few temporary services with them to help out. One such service was a trolley 14-Limited that used the abandoned trolley overhead on South Van Ness. The diesel 82-Chinatown was replaced with short runs of the 30-Stockton.

40|$|Scholarly {{discussions of}} {{accessibility}} and spatial mismatch largely ignore transit’s {{role in linking}} vulnerable populations to opportunity. Yet as the nation’s low-income population has become more suburban in recent decades, transit access may become an increasingly valuable, yet scarcer link to opportunity for those with the fewest resources and housing options. This study explores differences in transit access <b>for</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> with high concentrations of heavy transit users. Using data from the 2000 Census and the 5 -year 2005 – 2009 ACS, it compares changes in transit access levels across neighborhoods with high concentrations of blacks, Latinos, and the poor in Portland, OR. Results show that Portland’s neighborhoods of Latino concentration had the poorest relative access to transit. Further, levels of transit access declined <b>for</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> of black and Latino concentration during the study period...|$|R
