40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} fibroblast locomotory activity is the rearward transport across the leading lamella of various materials used {{to mark the}} cell surface. The two processes most frequently invoked as explanations for this transport phenomenon, called capping, are (a) retrograde membrane flow arising from directed membrane insertion and (b) rearward cortical cytoskeletal flow arising from cytoskeletal assembly and contraction. The retrograde lipid flow hypothesis, the most current form of the membrane flow scheme, makes explicit predictions about the movement of membrane proteins subjected to the postulated rearward lipid flow. Several of these predictions were tested by comparing the behavior of four membrane proteins, Pgp- 1, Thy- 1, H- 2, and influenza HA 0, identified by fluorescent antibodies. With the exception of Pgp- 1, these proteins were uniformly distributed under nonaggregated conditions but were capped when aggregated into patches. In contrast, Pgp- 1 was capped in similar time frames in both nonaggregated and aggregated states where the lateral diffusion coefficients were very different. Furthermore, the capping behavior of two tagged membrane proteins was markedly different yet both had similar diffusion coefficients. The results from these tests disprove the bulk membrane flow hypothesis and {{are at odds with}} explicit predictions of the retrograde lipid flow hypothesis for the mechanism of capping. This work, therefore, supports the alternative cytoskeletal- based mechanism for <b>driving</b> <b>capping.</b> Requirements for coupling cytoskeletal movement to membrane components are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{three-dimensional model}} is {{proposed for the}} electric potential arising from magnetopause reconnection, in which several approximations are made concerning configuration of the magnetosheath flow, limitations on {{the magnitude of the}} reconnection speed, and the geometry of the problem. These approximations are such that the model yields an upper limit for the potential. The magnitude of the polar cap ionospheric electric field computed from this model is larger than that measured on balloons by an average factor of about 3, and the model reproduces the temporal variations of the experimental data. It is concluded that magnetopause reconnection is a highly efficient process that is probably the dominant mechanism <b>driving</b> polar <b>cap</b> convection and supplying energy to the magnetosphere.

Given different types of expenditure within the budget, this rule has most effect on - and is most threatened by - spending on the Common Agricultural Policy. This article examines the merits of applying a balanced budget rule to the EU budget and explores the links between the budget and the CAP. The presence of the rule also forced the EU to improve its financial management. The 1999 CAP reform is examined.

The general perception is that the CAP drives the European budget. The budget, if not <b>driving</b> the <b>CAP,</b> imposes an increasingly tight constraint on its reform...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An oocyte {{undergoes}} {{two rounds}} of asymmetric division to generate a haploid gamete and two small polar bodies designed for apoptosis. Chromosomes play important roles in specifying the asymmetric meiotic divisions in the oocytes but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Results Chromosomes independently induce spindle formation and cortical actomyosin assembly into special cap and ring structures in the cortex of the oocyte. The spindle and the cortical cap/ring interact to generate mechanical forces, leading to polar body extrusion. Two distinct force-driven membrane changes were observed during 2 nd polar body extrusion: a protrusion of the cortical cap and a membrane invagination induced by an anaphase spindle midzone. The cortical cap protrusion and invagination help rotate the spindle perpendicularly so that the spindle midzone can induce bilateral furrows at {{the shoulder of the}} protruding cap, leading to an abscission of the polar body. It {{is interesting to note that}} while the mitotic spindle midzone induces bilateral furrowing, leading to efficient symmetric division in the zygote, the meiotic spindle midzone induced cytokinetic furrowing only locally. Conclusions Distinct forces <b>driving</b> cortical <b>cap</b> protrusion and membrane invagination are involved in spindle rotation and polar body extrusion during meiosis II in mouse oocytes. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{activity}} at {{the surface of the}} lava lake on Erta 'Ale volcano (Ethiopia) shows that large bubbles are regularly breaking at a fixed position on the lava lake. This is also where the small lava fountains are sometimes produced. Since this location is likely to be directly above the volcanic conduit feeding the lava lake, we have done continuous measurements between March 22 and 26, 2003 to understand the degassing of a volcano in permanent activity. The bubble size has been first estimated from videos, which once combined with the acoustic pressure, can constrain the source of the sound. The gas volume and overpressure stayed roughly constant, between 36 – 700 m 3 and 4 × 103 – 1. 8 × 104 Pa, respectively. Simultaneous thermal measurements showed regular peaks, which occurred when the crust was broken by a large bubble, hence gave a direct indication on the typical return time between the bubbles (1 h). These spherical cap bubbles had a high Reynolds number, 4600 – 20000, therefore a wake, periodically unstable, formed and detached from the bubble bottom. The bubbly wake, if the detachment occurs close to the surface, can explain the duration of lava fountains, measured on the videos. The periodic arrival of bubbly wakes, which mostly detach from the <b>driving</b> spherical <b>cap</b> within the lava lake, could explain the absence of cooling at Erta 'Ale, Erebus (Antartica), Villarica (Chile) and Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of Congo) without invoking a convective downflow of magma in the conduit, as previously done...|$|R
40|$|Three {{potential}} {{explanations of}} past {{reforms of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) can be identified in the literature: a budget constraint, pressure from General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO) negotiations or commitments and a paradigm shift emphasising agriculture’s provision of public goods. This discussion on the <b>driving</b> forces of <b>CAP</b> reform links to broader theoretical questions {{on the role of}} budgetary politics, globalisation of public policy and paradigm shift in explaining policy change. In this article, the Health Check reforms of 2007 / 2008 are assessed. They were probably more ambitious than first supposed, although it was a watered-down package agreed by ministers in November 2008. We conclude that the Health Check was not primarily driven by budget concerns or by the supposed switch from the state-assisted to the multifunctional policy paradigm. The European Commission’s wish to adopt an offensive negotiating stance in the closing phases of the Doha Round was a more likely explanatory factor. The shape and purpose of the CAP post- 2013 is contested with divergent views among the Member States...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common infections, especially in the elderly (≥ 65 years). The aim of this study was to quantify hospitalization costs for CAP in different age groups and in patients with different CAP risk profiles. Secondary objectives were to assess disease severity differences between placebo and vaccine receiving participants and identify cost <b>driving</b> factors of <b>CAP</b> in hospitalized elderly in the Netherlands. METHODS: This prospective cohort study of hospitalized CAP patients was executed in parallel to the Community Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA). Within the CAPiTA, a cohort of 84, 496 subjects aged ≥ 65, all suspected CAP-episodes presenting in one of the 58 participating hospitals between September 2008 and August 2013 were included. CAP was diagnosed on clinical and radiographical criteria. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-IPD-CAP episodes, regardless of the causing pathogen, were evaluated separately. Costs were calculated by multiplying recorded healthcare resources with Dutch unit cost prices for the year 2012. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify cost drivers. RESULTS: In the sentinel hospitals 3225 suspected CAP and IPD episodes were included, of which 1933 were radiographically confirmed by chest X-ray. Analyses were conducted on confirmed CAP episodes only. Overall mean length of hospital stay was 12. 1 days, the in-hospital mortality rate was 11. 26 %, and mean costs were € 8301 (95 % CI: € 7760 -€ 8999). When stratified in age-categories 65 - 74, 75 - 84 and ≥ 85, mean hospitalization costs were € 8674, € 8770 and € 6197, respectively (p[*]=[*] 0. 649). IPD-CAP and non-IPD-CAP mean hospitalization costs were € 13, 611 and € 8081, respectively. Higher CURB- 65 score and individuals at medium risk for developing pneumococcal disease were significantly associated with higher costs. Being male, lower age, previous admissions, lower risk, lower urbanity and higher socio-economic status were associated with lower costs. CONCLUSIONS: Mean hospitalization costs of a CAP subject were € 8301 and higher for IPD-CAP compared to non-IPD-CAP cases. Medium risk patients and higher CURB- 65 scores were identified as cost driving factors...|$|R

50|$|The {{clothing}} {{culture of}} Ireland {{is a very}} interesting aspect of the country. Irish clothes are generally very well-made and {{have a long history of}} significance attached to them.Men in Ireland are often seen wearing linen driving caps. Europeans have been fond of linen driving caps for centuries. The patterns and colors of these hats vary greatly by their design but are most often found in neutral colors. Patchwork is also a popular look for these caps, although other more respectable and somber designs are more appropriate for some settings. However they look, a quality linen <b>driving</b> <b>cap</b> should be cool and not stifle the wearer. Aran sweaters are a historical part of Irish culture. Clan Arans used to be very popular. Each family clan had its own unique stitching or pattern that was used in their sweaters. These sweaters were hand knit with careful attentiveness. Museums in Ireland have the different clan patterns registered and well-documented. Even today Aran sweaters remain a popular staple of the Irish wardrobe. Tweed is another fabric traditionally noted in Irish culture. In the past, looms were used to create the tweed fabrics, and these methods are still used in modern times to make high quality tweed. Because most Irish tweed is handwoven it is more costly and durable than tweed commonly manufactured in other parts of the world. Jackets are a very popular way to wear tweed, as tweed jackets are appropriate for many occasions and have a simple yet elegant style.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} analyses recent CAP reform, {{the so-called}} Health Check, and evaluates the explanatory {{power of the}} theories usually applied to CAP change or the lack thereof. The paper starts out by giving a brief account over the founding ideas and instruments of CAP before it addresses recent reforms, the Fischler reform of 2003 and the so-called Health Check of 2008, in detail. Doing so, it is shown that member states resistance against a stronger marketisation of CAP persists while the discoursive trend towards rural development is not financially supported by member states. Three sets of theories commonly used in political science CAP analysis â€ ideas, interests and institutions â€ are identified and explored {{with regard to their}} explanatory power for the latest reform. The contribution concludes by arguing that there is no single factor <b>driving</b> <b>CAP</b> reform but that a triangle of international trade negotiations, national and sectoral preferences as well as dominating paradigms in public (and elite) discourses must be taken into consideration when seeking to explain the direction and the occurrence of CAP change. agriculture policy; political science; European Commission; international trade; discourse...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two {{different}} strategies for managing interest rate exposure. One involves maintaining a borrowing portfolio using {{short and long}} term debt lines in order to maintain an average borrowing cost. The second involves using interest rate caps to manage exposure to interest rate risk. The two strategies are compared using a set of daily quarterly rates from three months out to 10 years (120 months) of BBSW zero rates, par rates and forward rates from June 2000 to September 2006. The data set of implied volatilities (Appendix I used for interest cap quoting and pricing) consists of volatilities for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 year maturities; the data set is made up of daily closing mid-quotes for the period. We examine whether interest rate caps would be a better alternative for minimising interest rate risk as compared to a structure that combines a portfolio of rolling short-term debt with one of rolling long-term debt lines. Using principal component analysis (PCA) we explore the behaviour of, and the number of factors driving volatilities. As caps are quoted in terms of implied volatilities, and we know BlackÃŒs (1976) model is very sensitive to changes in these volatilities. We use PCA to examine the factors <b>driving</b> <b>cap</b> price volatilities. We explore the best way of using caps to manage interest rate risk. This should help us understand what factors affect cap prices and how many factors might be used in the interest rate models used to price interest rate derivatives such as caps and floors. We use Sharpe ratios to assess the relative borrowing costs of different strategies in relation to the volatility of their outcomes. We examine whether interest rate caps would be a more efficient method for minimising interest rate risk as compared to the a portfolio of loans.
