40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} how to increase birdsong loudness and the visibility <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in low-density residential areas by controlling urban morphological parameters. The spatial sound level distributions of birdsong at 12 sites sampled from a GIS database of Assen, the Netherlands, were simulated by noise mapping techniques and calculated using a MATLAB program on spatial sound level matrices. The visibilities <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> are analysed and calculated by Visibility Analysis Graph in Space Syntax. Correlation analyses were conducted between the obtained data on spatial sound level indices, the mean visibility and urban morphological parameters. The results show that birdsong loudness has significant positive linear relationships with urban morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction (R 2 = 0. 491), <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Perimeters (R 2 = 0. 491) and <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Dispersion Index (R 2 = 0. 618), while the visibility <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>area</b> has negative linear relationships with morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction (R 2 = 0. 431) and <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Perimeters (R 2 = 0. 799). It has also been found that in the proximity <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> the visibility <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> has a positive relationship with birdsong loudness, whereas in most <b>areas</b> further from <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> the visibility <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> has a negative relationship with birdsong loudness. Either increasing birdsong loudness or enhancing visibility <b>of</b> the <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> by controlling urban morphological parameters is helpful for the optimisation of soundscape design with masking effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In this study, {{we studied}} {{relations}} between surface temperature <b>of</b> urban <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and factors <b>of</b> each <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> shown as Tab. 1. We analyzed Landsat TM and ETM+ data (Path: 107;Row: 35) {{and the area}} which includes metropolitan Tokyo was chosen as analyzed area. Analysis of the relation of surface temperature and factors <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> were done by regression analysis of each factors and combination of principle component analysis and multiple regressionss and neural network. As a result, surface temperature was obviously influenced by three major components deduced by principle component analysis. The first component represented the effect of factors related to the sizes and the shapes <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> the second component represented the effect of coverage of vegetation and the third component represented the water. The effect of factors related to the sizes and the shapes <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and thar related the water was significant for analyzing the decrease of surface temperature.

40|$|The article substantiates the {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> geoportals’ creation for city (town) {{that will serve}} as a tool to order and systematize the information on quantitative, qualitative and other indicators <b>of</b> <b>green</b> spaces, including the volume, nature and mode of their use, as well as being the source of this information visualization by the Internet. It is noted that in the Ukrainian cities (towns), local governments monitor <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> by accounting and updating the register of plants by species composition and age. All kinds of planting should be included into the register: trees, shrubs, herbs, flower beds, lawns, etc. However, much of this reporting information is presented only by tabular data without accompanying cartographic visualization. As there is no single source of all available systematized information about the <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the city (town) with the corresponding cartographic visualization, it is difficult to systematize the recording <b>of</b> existing <b>green</b> spaces, to clearly delineate their boundaries, to monitor their condition, etc. To facilitate the solution to these issues we need to create a geoportal <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the city (town) as a public source, containing a cartographic image <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>green</b> zone and correlated text, table, photographic and other information. On these bases, on Google’s service, we have developed a geoportal <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> for Sumy town, intended for public use. The content of the portal is presented by the layers: parks and squares (allotted 14 zones), <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> (6), Natural reserve objects that are green zones - botanical gardens, parks-monuments (3), urban forests (2), boulevards (2), tracts (1). Functional capabilities of the geoportal include activating and deactivating visibility of thematic layers, outputting textual and photographic information about the greenery, represented in the geoportal, scaling, measuring the areas and distances, the mode of viewing the streets, laying the routes.

40|$|Malmö {{strives to}} become an {{attractive}} and sustainable city by 2030. Continued population growth is {{a major reason for}} the need to densify within the existing urban structures. But more inhabitants will also increase pressure on usage and demand for green spaces in the city. <b>Green</b> space is <b>of</b> importance for human well-being and health, especially in urban environments. However the importance <b>of</b> <b>green</b> space is being marginalised in current debate and urban planning, due to the intensive focus on densiﬁcation. The relevance <b>of</b> <b>green</b> space as an environmental quality has neither been recognised sufficiently in discussions on environmental justice. Previous policy and research has not integrated the socioeconomic dimension when assessing green space distribution. Hence this case study aimed to investigate the socio-spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in Malmö. A theoretical framework was compiled including concepts on environmental justice, i. e. the equal distribution of environmental qualities among different social groups. Moreover concepts regarding access (public/private), distance (walkability) and size (utilisation) <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> were considered. A quantitative analysis was conducted with secondary data. As no comprehensive data set covered more recent years, census data and spatial data from 2005 was used for further analysis. The data was processed and analysed {{with the help of a}} geographic information system (GIS). With this approach green space and <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> could be identified. <b>Green</b> <b>areas</b> were categorised according to the level of public access, the size and the respective recommended distances to homes. In addition several socioeconomic factors were extracted from the census data and visualised in GIS. Thus the least advantaged neighbourhoods that lacked various public <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> could be located. On the city level it could be identified that only 13 % of the total land area were covered with public <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> resulting in 46 sq m per inhabitant in 2005. In April 2011 the population of Malmö passed the threshold of 300 000. Assuming that the amount <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> had not changed since 2005 (unlikely), every inhabitant would have had 38 sq m <b>of</b> public <b>green</b> <b>area</b> in 2011. Considering these numbers in a Swedish context reveals that Malmö is on the bottom line <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>area</b> provision. On the neighbourhood level the greatest deﬁcit was found in the eastern parts of central Malmö (e. g. Ostervärn), covering a network of neighbourhoods further south (Norra Sofielund, Södra Sofielund, Almhög, Gullviksborg). In total 32 neighbourhoods were characterised by above average percentage of children, elderly, foreign born or population density. Moreover almost all neighbourhoods lacking <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> were characterised by below average income. The results showed evidence for inequalities in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> between different social groups. This poses an incentive for further investigations in the field of environmental justice and sustainable urban development. Issues like actual walking distance, barriers and safety, qualities <b>of</b> <b>green</b> spaces and user experiences should be investigated in future research. Noting that the data used in this study was from 2005, it is crucial to update and determine shifts in socio-spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> in the city today. Whilst the population is still increasing, it is likely that even more green space has vanished in the 7 years since 2005. All these issues are essential for a good knowledge based planning <b>of</b> the <b>green</b> and just future of Malmö...|$|R
40|$|Background Previous {{research}} shows a positive {{link between the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>area</b> in one's residential neighbourhood and self-reported health. However, {{little research has been}} done on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>green</b> <b>area,</b> as well as on quantity and quality of smaller natural elements in the streetscape. This study investigates the link between the objectively assessed quantity and quality <b>of</b> (1) <b>green</b> <b>areas</b> and (2) streetscape greenery {{on the one hand and}} three self-reported health indicators on the other. Methods 80 Dutch urban neighbourhoods were selected, varying in the amount <b>of</b> nearby <b>green</b> <b>area</b> per dwelling, as determined by Geographic Information System analysis. The quality <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as the quantity and quality of streetscape greenery, was assessed by observers using an audit tool. Residents of each neighbourhood were asked to complete a questionnaire on their own health (N= 1641). In multilevel regression analyses, we examined the relationship between greenspace indicators and three health indicators, controlling for socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results Both indicators for the quantity of greenspace were positively related to all three health indicators. Quantity and quality indicators were substantially correlated in the case of streetscape greenery. Nevertheless, the quality indicators tended to have added predictive value for the health indicators, given that the quantity information was already included in the model. Conclusions The quantity and also the quality of greenspace in one's neighbourhood seem relevant with regard to health. Furthermore, streetscape greenery is at least as strongly related to self-reported health as <b>green</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
