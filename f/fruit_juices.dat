In this research,dragon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was concentrated by using freeze concentration process. Concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> can be preserved longer than non concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice.</b> Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice.</b> In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and cooling medium temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit. Dragon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> that was blended and standardized its initial concentration was put into the crystallization unit. The <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and cooling medium temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the cooling medium in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best cooling medium temperature. The dragon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> increased. For the first study where the temperature of the cooling medium was remaining constant, the highest concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was 17 °Brix.

5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E

His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and {{provide the basis for}} family identification and species discrimination.|$|E

METHODS: A strategic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (updated to March, 2014) was performed to retrieve the randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale.
