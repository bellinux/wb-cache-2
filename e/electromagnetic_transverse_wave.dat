40|$|In {{this section}} of the course notes, we will go over the {{fundamentals}} behind physically based shading models, starting with a qualitative description of the underlying physics, followed by a quantitative description of the relevant mathematical models, and finally discussing how these mathematical models can be implemented for shading. The Physics of Shading The physical phenomena underlying shading are those related to the interaction of light with matter. To understand these phenomena, it helps to have a basic {{understanding of the nature of}} light. Figure 1 : Light is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>wave.</b> Light is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>wave,</b> which means that it oscillates in directions perpendic-ular to its propagation (see Figure 1). Since it is a wave, light is characterized by its wavelength—the distance from peak to peak. Electromagnetic wavelengths cover a very wide range but only a tiny part of this range (about 400 to 700 nanometers) is visible to humans and thus of interest for shading (see Figure 2). The effect matter has on light is defined by a property called the refractive index. The refractive...|$|E
40|$|When an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> propagates {{through an}} inhomogeneous plasma {{so that its}} {{electric}} field has a component {{in the direction of}} the background density gradient, there appears a disbalance of charge in every plasma layer, caused by the density gradient. Due to this some additional longitudinal electric field component appears {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This longitudinal field may couple with the usual electrostatic longitudinal perturbations like the ion acoustic, electron Langmuir, and ion plasma waves. As a result, these standard electrostatic waves are modified and in addition to this a completely new low-frequency mode appears. Some basic features of the coupling and modification of the ion acoustic wave, and properties of the new mode are discussed here, in ordinary electron-ion and in pair plasmas. Comment: 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the ion acoustic (IA) wave in plasmas containing ions and electrons {{with the same}} temperature is of minor importance due to strong damping of the wave by hot resonant ions. In this work it will be shown that the IA wave is susceptible to excitation even in plasmas with hot ions when both an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> and a background density gradient {{are present in the}} plasma, and in addition the wave is in fact unstable (i. e., growing) in the case of permeating homogeneous plasmas. The multi-component fluid theory is used to describe the IA wave susceptibility for excitation in inhomogeneous plasmas and its coupling with electromagnetic waves. The growing IA wave in permeating homogeneous plasmas is described by the kinetic theory. In plasmas with density and temperature gradients the IA wave is effectively coupled with the electromagnetic waves. In comparison to ordinary IA wave in homogeneous plasma, the Landau damping of the present wave is much smaller, and to demonstrate this effect a simple but accurate fluid model is presented for the Landau damping. In the case of permeating plasmas, a kinetic mechanism for the current-less IA wave instability is presented, with a very low threshold for excitation as compared with ordinary electron-current-driven kinetic instability. Such growing IA waves can effectively heat plasma in the upper solar atmosphere by a stochastic heating mechanism presented in the work. The results of this work suggest that the IA wave role in the heating of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere and corona) should be reexamined...|$|E
40|$|The {{solution}} to the problem of excitation of longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> in randomly inhomogeneous media is reduced to the derivation of a complex effective dielectric constant (EDC) tensor which nonlocally connects together the average macroscopic electromagnetic fields in continuous media, it is implied that the field values which are rapidly fluctuating on a microscopic scale in space and time become smoothed out in a specified way due to the inhomogeneous mixing of diffusion. Proceedings from the derived general expression for the EDC tensor new modes of longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> generation due to fluctuation in the parameters of the medium was predicted. In this connection, it is of interest to investigate the peculiarities of <b>electromagnetic</b> longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in such randomly inhomogeneous media where, apart from the charged particle concentration change, the random spatial and temporal changes of natural frequency of closely located oscillators take place...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{by using the}} {{assumptions}} that wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance of an electric dipole, {{which in turn is}} much smaller than a distance up to the point of observation, new results for radiation of electric dipole were obtained. These results generalize and extend the classical solution, and they indicate that under the above assumptions the classical electric dipole emits both long-range longitudinal electric and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves.</b> For a specific values of the dipole system parameters the longitudinal and transverse electric fields are shown. Total power emitted by electric and electromagnetic waves are calculated and compared. It was shown that under the standard assumption of charge separation distance being much smaller than wavelength: a) classical solution correctly describes the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> waves; b) <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are dominant and longitudinal electric waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to fourth degree of frequency; d) according to classical solution most of the power is emitted perpendicular to electric dipole axis; e) our solution reduces to classical solution. In case wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance: a) the classical solution is not valid and it overestimates the total radiated power; b) longitudinal electric waves are dominant and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to second degree of frequency; d) most of the power is emitted in a narrow beam along the dipole axis, thus emission of waves is focused as with lasers. In the region where wavelength is equivalent to charge separation distance: a) power emitted by longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> are equal; b) power of the <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> has a dip. It would be interesting to observe these results in experiments. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures, 13 citation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} {{iterative method}} is presented for the fast analysis of cylindrically conformal microstrip structures. Based on {{the transmission line}} modeling (TLM) method and the fast modal transform (FMT) theory, this technique accelerates {{the process of the}} calculation by introducing the concept of the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> instead of the transverse fields considered in the traditional algorithm. Within cylindrically stratified media, the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are represented by the hybrid modal basis functions.

Furthermore, the surface electric fields and electric currents of the cylindrically conformal microstrip antenna fed by means of a microstripline are calculated via the iterative process. On this basis, the input impedance of the antenna can also be obtained. And the results gained by utilizing iterative approach are compared with those from the published references to demonstrate the accuracy or efficiency of this method. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} reports 1, 2 we {{have discussed}} single charged-particle motion in a con-stant pitch and constant amplitude magnetic perturbation with relation to "corkscrew" injection and wave-particle interaction in magnetized plasma. We have worked out the motion of untrapped 1 and trapped 2 particles. Here we apply Dupree's strong turbulence theory 3 to wave-particle interaction in a <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagating parallel to an external magnetic field. By using a transformation of the velocity coordinate, 4 which is essentially transforma-tion to the wave frame used in studies of the single-particle motion, 2 we reduce the Vlasov equation to a one-dimensional diffusion-type equation. Then manipulation sim-ilar {{to that of the}} longitudinal wave case by Dupree 3 leads to nonlinear wave-particle interaction including "trapped " particle effects. We compare the results in the strong field limit, where the trapping effect is impor-tant, with the results of the single-particle model. The results agree except for numer-ical factors. The single-particle calculation gives a proof of the correctness of the strong turbulence theory, which includes some crucial assumptions and provides some clearer physical intuitions. 1.

The ratio of the background plasma frequency squared to the electron gyrofrequency squared is taken to be sufficiently larger than unity. Such a parameter regime is relevant to many space and astrophysical situations. A detailed study of the amplification process is carried out over a wide range of physical parameters including the loss-cone index, the ratio of the electron mass energy to the temperature of the energetic component, the field-aligned drift speed, the normalized density, and the wave propagation angle...|$|R

The new approach leads to a simple scattering relation in terms of wave propagators and single-interface scattering operators only. These temporal integral operators are related to the four timedependent susceptibility kernels of the medium through non-linear Volterra equations of the second kind.

It is shown that the 2 f(p) radiation grows by the process L + L going to T + S (where L, S, and T denote Langmuir, ion acoustic, and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> respectively), proceeding in two 3 -wave steps in the two wings of the foreshock.

They are distinguished from <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> by a donut-like configuration of electric and magnetic fields with a strong field component along the propagation direction. Here, we report that such 'Flying Donuts' can be generated from conventional pulses using a singular metamaterial converter designed to manipulate both the spatial and spectral structure of the input pulse. The ability to generate Flying Donuts is of fundamental interest, as they shall interact with matter in unique ways, including non-trivial field transformations upon reflection from interfaces and the excitation of toroidal response and anapole modes in matter, thus offering new opportunities for telecommunications, sensing, and spectroscopy.

Our numerical modelling between the microwave and optical regimes reveals that conductor kinetic inductance creates an ultra-broadband LC region. This resultant frequency-independent attenuation is an ideal characteristic that {{is known to be}} non-existent in macro-scale transmission lines.
