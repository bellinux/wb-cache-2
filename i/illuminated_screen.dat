5000|$|The {{experience}} of the 1968 changes led to some changes in vehicle orders for 1969. It was recognised that long single deckers had caused congestion, and that the flat fare system would not work in all cases. The inability of the passimeters to issue change also inconvenienced passengers. In order to address the first problem, a number of front entrance double deck Daimler Fleetlines were ordered. On {{some of the new}} routes [...] "coarsened" [...] rather than flat fares were to be introduced. The vehicles for these services were to have [...] "split entrances", with two passenger streams. An <b>illuminated</b> <b>screen</b> displayed the various fares from the stop, while a central bar divided the entrance into two doorways. Passengers who had the correct change were to pass to the right and use the coin-operated entry gate, passengers who needed change were to use the left doorway and pay the driver.|$|E

30|$|Quartz stone density {{analysis}} {{was done by}} digital analysis of the 1 m 2 images using Adobe Photoshop software. In a first step, all vascular plants with clear bounds (e.g., Agyroderma sp.) were masked and saved as an extra image. The remaining image was displayed with maximum contrast as {{a black and white}} image, the soil being shown in black and the pebbles in white. The coverage of each color was analyzed with ArcView 3.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, WA, USA) software and the Spatial Analyst application. All images were converted into grids, in which black pixels were assigned the value 0 and white ones the value 1. The number of pixels with each value was extracted from the attribute table and converted into percentages. The images with the vascular plants were processed in the same manner and their percentage subtracted from the total pixel number per image, yielding the percentages of quartz pebbles and bare soil. In order to validate this digital method, three 25 × 25 cm areas of one sampling image were printed in color, and on each print, two 5 × 5 cm areas were randomly covered with transparent scale paper. On an <b>illuminated</b> <b>screen,</b> the edges of the quartz pebbles were traced with a pen onto the 5 × 5 cm scale papers, which were then enlarged and the quartz pebble pixels were counted. A comparison of the two methods revealed a maximum difference of 3.8 %.|$|E

The exact rate necessary varies by brightness—40 Hz is acceptable in dimly lit rooms, while up to 80 Hz may be necessary for bright displays that extend into peripheral vision.

Electromagnetic interaction between subsequent scales is modeled by mutually independent Scale-Changing Networks and finally the complete structure is simply represented by a cascade of these networks. Very good agreement is obtained between simulation results from SCT and the Finite Element Method (FEM) when computing the reflection/transmission coefficients and electromagnetic field backscattered by thick and finite size frequency selective surfaces. The computation time is significantly reduced when using SCT-based software compared with the FEM simulation tool. 1...|$|R
