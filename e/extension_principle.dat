50|$|The order <b>extension</b> <b>principle</b> is constructively provable for finite sets using topological sorting algorithms, {{where the}} partial order is {{represented}} by a directed acyclic graph with the set's elements as its vertices. Several algorithms can find an extension in linear time. Despite the ease of finding a single linear extension, the problem of counting all linear extensions of a finite partial order is #P-complete; however, it may be estimated by a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme. Among all partial orders with a fixed number of elements and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the partial orders that have {{the largest number of}} linear extensions are semiorders.|$|E
50|$|Bang & Olufsen invented and {{patented}} {{the so-called}} Dolby HX PRO (Headroom <b>eXtension)</b> <b>principle</b> for combining bias control with the Dolby system for better high-frequency response in cassette recorders. Tandberg invented the cross-field recording system for tape recorders where a separate {{head with the}} bias was used. Adding bias to the recorded signal in the one head had tended to limit the system's high-frequency response, due to interaction between bias and signal. The cross-field system produced less interference from the bias signal. This allowed extended high-frequency performance compared to mixing the two signals in the recording head, but mechanical tolerances for cross-field are tight. The system required frequent readjustment and was largely abandoned. Japanese manufacturer Akai, however, persisted with cross-field bias and successfully marketed portable and mains-operated machines featuring the cross-field system.|$|E

40|$|Defining the {{standard}} Boolean operations on fuzzy Booleans with the compositional rule of inference (CRI) or Zadeh's <b>extension</b> <b>principle</b> gives counter-intuitive results.

It is shown that the adapted CRI gives the expected results for {{the standard}} Boolean operations on fuzzy Booleans. As a second application, we show that the adapted CRI enables a don't-care value in approximate reasoning. From the close connection between the CRI and Zadeh's <b>extension</b> <b>principle,</b> we derive an adaptation of the <b>extension</b> <b>principle,</b> which, like the modified CRI, also gives the expected Boolean operations on fuzzy Booleans...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Plaque {{analysis}} in IVUS planes needs accurate intima and adventitia models. Large variety in adventitia descriptors difficulties its detection and motivates using a classification strategy for selecting {{points on the}} structure. Whatever the set of descriptors used, the selection stage suffers from fake responses due to noise and uncompleted true curves. In order to smooth background noise while strengthening responses, we apply a restricted anisotropic filter that homogenizes grey levels along the image significant structures. Candidate points are extracted {{by means of a}} simple semi supervised adaptive classification of the filtered image response to edge and calcium detectors. The final model is obtained by interpolating the former line segments with an anisotropic contour closing technique based on functional <b>extension</b> <b>principles.</b> ...|$|R
