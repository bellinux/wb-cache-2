5000|$|The church {{building}} {{was added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. [...] The listing also includes a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower which is believed to be 19th century in construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower, {{similar to those}} at Feock and Gwennap, which may date from before the 15th century. The bell tower uses a set of six batons laid out similar to piano keys, and three medieval bells. These were recast in 1926.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower {{of which the}} lower section {{functions}} as the entrance way through the wall surrounding the church. The tower is built of wood and was erected between 1804 and 1806, and painted white in 1811. The bell tower replaced an older tower built in 1695 by Jon Jonsson. There are two bells in the tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} indeed {{designed}} in the classic style of an early basilica with a campanile or <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower. For the Danish Lutheran community, its style and rich ornamentation were rather unconventional, prompting {{a fair amount of}} criticism at the time. At one point, Carl Jacobsen was described by his own priest as a freethinker, unready to follow the trends and the dogma of the day.|$|R
50|$|In 1848 {{the site}} was {{acquired}} by the Church of England. A parsonage was constructed {{at the corner of}} William and Elizabeth Streets in 1850-51, and St John's Church was erected on the site, further along William Street, in 1850-54. In 1868 it was extended. A <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower was erected in 1877, and in 1879-80 a building which served as church school, synod hall, library and committee rooms was built in the eastern corner of the site.|$|R
50|$|Examples of the Romanesque {{basilica}} style are {{the church}} of Oberm√ºnster, dating from 1010, and the abbey church of St. Emmeram, built in the 13th century, remarkable {{as one of the}} few German churches with a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower. The beautiful cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in Germany, are still in a fair state of preservation. In 1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the prince of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster-general of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|The St. Nicholas Chapel is a {{historic}} Russian Orthodox church in the native village of Igiugig, Alaska, United States. It {{is one of the}} region's smallest churches, measuring 12 x 18 ft, with clapboard siding, a metal gable roof, and a small shed-roof vestibule at one end. The long walls each have three sash windows. A <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower, holding five bells, stands next to the church. The church was built in 1930. The vestibule has seen the addition of a little onion dome sometime after 1990.|$|R
5000|$|Zeerijp (...) is {{a village}} north of city of Groningen. Its most {{striking}} building is its medieval brick church with <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower. Formerly dedicated to John the Baptist, {{now it is}} a Dutch Reformed church. Also there is a famous organ inside the church, a Faber organ. Because there are so few inhabitants, Zeerijp has no shops, but there is a primary school 'De Wilgenstee' and a cafe. Also, there is a famous mill, 'de Leeuw'. There is also a gold and silver smith, Van Hulsen.|$|R
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1963 {{the cathedral}} bells, which were housed in the central tower, were in need of an {{overhaul}} and ringing was suspended. In 1965 the Dean asked George Pace, architect to York Minster, to prepare specifications for a new bell frame and for electrification of the clock and tolling mechanism. Due to structural difficulties {{and the cost of}} replacing the bells in the central tower it was advised that consideration should be given to building a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> and clock tower in the southeast corner of the churchyard. It was decided to proceed with that plan, and in 1969 an announcement was made that the first <b>detached</b> cathedral <b>bell</b> tower was to be erected since the building of the campanile at Chichester Cathedral in the 15thcentury. In February 1969, nine of the ten bells in the central tower were removed to be recast by John Taylor & Co as a ring of twelve bells with a flat sixth. The new bells were cast in 1973. Work on the new bell-tower began in February 1973. Two old bells dating from 1606 and 1626 were left in the tower. On 26February 1975 the bells were rung {{for the first time to}} celebrate the wedding of a member of the Grosvenor family. The official opening on 25June 1975 was performed by the Duke of Gloucester. The belfry is known as the Dean Addleshaw Tower, after the dean of the cathedral responsible for its construction. The tower is built in concrete, faced with sandstone at its base. It is the first <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower to be built for a cathedral in this country since the Reformation. Between the bell tower and the south transept is a garden in remembrance of the Cheshire Regiment (originally the 22ndRegiment of Foot).|$|R
60|$|Now, with {{reference}} to the Enchanted Isles, we are fortunately supplied with just such a noble point of observation in a remarkable rock, from its peculiar figure called of old by the Spaniards, Rock Rodondo, or Round Rock. Some two hundred and fifty feet high, rising straight from the sea ten miles from land, with the whole mountainous group to the south and east. Rock Rodondo occupies, on a large scale, very much the position which the famous Campanile or <b>detached</b> <b>Bell</b> Tower of St. Mark does with respect to the tangled group of hoary edifices around it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} parish {{church was}} St Bartholomew's Church situated close to {{and east of}} the castle. The church was founded by either Richard Fitz Scrobe or his son. The chancel was probably built in 1362. The north transept was probably consecrated in 1351 by Bishop John de Trillek. This was the Chantry Chapel of the local Knights Templar. The south aisle was built between 1310 and 1320[...] There is a <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower (one of six in the county) that dates from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The church is between it and the castle. There are no openings in the bell tower between it and the castle. (See The Cathedral Library, Hereford). This beautiful church is now redundant ...|$|R
50|$|Ardcroney Church is a T-plan gable-fronted church, {{built in}} 1838. Along with a later (c1975) <b>detached</b> round <b>bell</b> tower with conical slate roof {{is listed as}} a {{protected}} structure by Tipperary County Council (RPS Ref S583). The local Church Of Ireland church (pictured) was moved to Bunratty folk park where it was unveiled in 1998.|$|R
5|$|A <b>detached</b> four-storey <b>bell</b> {{tower was}} built near the riverbanks {{by the first}} Augustinian Recollect priest of Loboc. It has seven bells, with the 1863 bell being the oldest and the 1937 bell, named for Father Cayetano Bastes, being the largest. It also has a large wooden ratchet, {{installed}} in 1899, used during Holy Week, and a clock made by the Altonaga Company, installed in 1893.|$|R
50|$|The {{townscape}} {{is dominated}} by the <b>detached</b> 16th century <b>bell</b> tower (known as the Beccles bell tower) of St Michael's Church. Like {{the main body of the}} church, the tower is Perpendicular Gothic in style and is 97 ft tall. The interior of the church was badly damaged by fire in 1586. It has a 13th century font.|$|R
50|$|The monastic {{remains in}} Bedfordshire include the fine {{fragment}} {{of the church}} of the Augustinian priory at Dunstable, serving as the parish church; Elstow Abbey near Bedford, which belonged to a Benedictine nunnery founded by Judith, niece of William the Conqueror in 1078; and portions of the Gilbertine Chicksands Priory and of a Cistercian foundation at Old Warden. In the parish churches, many of which are of great interest, the predominant styles are Decorated and Perpendicular. Work of pre-Conquest date, however, is found in the massive tower of Clapham church, the tower of St. Peter's Church in Bedford town centre, and in a door of St Mary the Virgin in Stevington. Fine Norman and Early English work is seen at Dunstable and Elstow, and the later style is illustrated by the large cruciform churches at Leighton Buzzard and at Felmersham on the Ouse above Bedford. Among the perpendicular additions to the church last named may be noted a very beautiful oaken rood screen. To illustrate Decorated and Perpendicular the churches of Clifton and of Marston Moretaine, with its massive <b>detached</b> <b>bell</b> tower, may be mentioned; and Cople church is a good specimen of fine Perpendicular work. The church of Cockayne Hatley, near Potton, is fitted with rich Flemish carved wood, mostly from the abbey of Alne near Charleroi, and dating from 1689, but brought here by a former rector early in the 19th century. In medieval domestic architecture the county is not rich. The mansion of Woburn Abbey dates mainly {{from the middle of the}} 18th century in its present form.|$|R
50|$|Following the cyclone of 5 December 1885 which {{destroyed}} the 1868 Tingalpa church the local Anglican community, not prosperous but determined to rebuild, reconstructed their church using timbers salvaged {{from the original}} building. The second and present Christ Church Tingalpa was re-consecrated on 25 July 1886, smaller and less decorative than the first building, but still of weatherboard construction with a shingled roof. A concrete floor was laid this time, to give the building additional stability in strong winds. An early, undated photograph shows a <b>detached,</b> timber-framed <b>bell</b> tower with double cross-bracing and a pyramid-shaped shingled roof, {{to the east of}} the chancel. By the late 1880s Bulimba had become more densely settled and Wynnum-Lota-Manly boomed following the opening of the Cleveland railway line (via Wynnum) in November 1889. By the mid-1890s the Anglican parish of Tingalpa, still approximately 50 square miles, had a population of well over 6,000. St Peter's Anglican Church was erected at Wynnum in 1898. By 1899 the Bulimba church held 260 seats; St Peter's held 120; and Christ Church, with its 50 seats, was clearly no longer the focus of Tingalpa parish. In 1900 St John the Baptist Church was removed from the Tingalpa parish, and the Tingalpa rector concentrated his efforts on the booming Wynnum-Manly district.|$|R
