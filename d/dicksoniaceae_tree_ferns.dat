40|$|Abstract Invasive mammals can {{fundamentally}} alter native plant communities, {{especially on}} isolated islands where plants evolved without them. The globally invasive feral pig (Sus scrofa) {{can be particularly}} destructive to native plant communities. <b>Tree</b> <b>ferns</b> are an important understory component in many forests facilitating {{the establishment of a}} variety of species. However, the extent and effects of feral pig damage to <b>tree</b> <b>ferns,</b> and associated impacts on plant community regeneration, are largely unknown. We quantified the effect that feral pig damage has on <b>tree</b> <b>fern</b> growth, survival, and epiphytic woody seedling abundance over 1 year on 438 randomly selected <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> of three endemic species (Cibotium chamissoi, Cibotium glau-cum, and Cibotium menziesii) in a Hawaiian montane wet forest with high <b>tree</b> <b>fern</b> and feral pig densities. Across all <b>tree</b> <b>fern</b> species, feral pigs damaged 13 % of individuals over 1 year. Compared with undamaged <b>tree</b> <b>ferns,</b> moderately- to heavily-damaged individuals had decreases of 4 to 27 % in trunk length increment and lost tenfold more fronds. <b>Tree</b> <b>fern</b> angle (standing, leaning, prone, or semi-prone) and woody seedling abundance co-varied with feral pig damage. Specifically, damaged <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> were more often prone or semi-prone and supported more seedlings, but also had annual mortality up to 34 % higher than undamaged <b>tree</b> <b>ferns.</b> Overall, feral pig damage had substantial negative effects on <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> by reducing growth and survival. Given the importance of <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> as regeneration sites for a variety of native plants, feral pig damage to <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> will likely alter future forest composition and structure. Specifically, feral pig damage to <b>tree</b> <b>ferns</b> reduces potential establishment sites for species that either regenerate preferentially as epiphytes or are currently restricted to epiphytic establishment due to ground rooting by feral pigs...|$|R
