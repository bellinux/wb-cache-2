40|$|The {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} gene encodes a peroxisomal integral {{membrane protein}} (ALDP) consisting of 745 amino acids with a molecular weight of 75 kDa. ALDP expression was studied in fibroblasts from 24 male ALD patients from 17 unrelated ALD <b>kindreds.</b> In four <b>kindreds</b> an identical 2 -base-pair deletion was found. We report {{the absence of}} ALDP in 12 <b>kindreds</b> carrying nonsense mutations, frame shifts or amino acid substitutions in the carboxy terminus of ALDP, together accounting for 71 % of the ALD <b>kindreds.</b> ALDP was present in five <b>kindreds</b> (29 %) with amino acid substitutions in the amino terminal half of the protein; in two of these <b>kindreds</b> ALDP was present although at a reduced level.

5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain.

Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century.

40|$|Analysis {{of genetic}} {{heterogeneity}} in 40 <b>kindreds</b> with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), with 20 polymorphic markers, showed that significant heterogeneity is present (P=. 001) and that 56 % of <b>kindreds</b> are of RP 3 type and that 26 % are of RP 2 type.

40|$|Individuals with {{a family}} history of {{pancreatic}} cancer have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Quantification of this risk provides a rational basis for cancer risk counseling and for screening for early pancreatic cancer. In a prospective registry-based study, we estimated the risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals {{with a family}} history of pancreatic cancer. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by comparing the number of incident pancreatic cancers observed with those expected using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) rates. Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) <b>kindreds</b> were defined as <b>kindreds</b> having at least one pair of first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, and sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) <b>kindreds</b> as families without such an affected pair. Nineteen incident pancreatic cancers developed among 5, 179 individuals from 838 <b>kindreds</b> (at baseline, 370 FPC <b>kindreds</b> and 468 SPC <b>kindreds).</b> Of these 5, 179 individuals, 3, 957 had at least one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer and contributed 10, 538 person-years of follow-up. In this group, the observed-to-expected rate of pancreatic cancer was significantly elevated in members of FPC <b>kindreds</b> [9. 0; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 4. 5 - 16. 1], but not in the SPC <b>kindreds</b> (1. 8; 95 % CI., 0. 22 - 6. 4). This risk in FPC <b>kindreds</b> was elevated in individuals with three (32. 0; 95 % CI, 10. 2 - 74. 7), two (6. 4; CI, 1. 8 - 16. 4), or one (4. 6; CI, 0. 5 - 16. 4) first-degree relative(s) with pancreatic cancer. Risk was not increased among 369 spouses and other genetically unrelated relatives. Risk was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers.

40|$|A rec(8) dup(q) syndrome, {{secondary}} to a pericentric inversion [...] inv(8) (p 23 q 22) [...] {{has been identified}} in 26 probands from Hispanic <b>kindreds</b> in the southwestern United States. The clinical phenotype of the Hispanic rec(8) syndrome includes a dysmorphic facies, cardiovascular and urinary-tract malformations, and mental retardation. Segregation analysis utilizing pedigree and cytogenetic data from 31 <b>kindreds</b> including five additional <b>kindreds</b> from additional sources has provided computation of genetic risks for counseling. An inv(8) carrier parent has a 6. 2 % risk of having a rec(8) child. The transmission rate of the inv(8) was significantly higher for inv(8) carrier mothers (59 %) than for carrier fathers (42 %). The combined transmission rate for both sexes was 53 %. Risk for spontaneous abortion or stillbirth (11. 3 %) was not higher {{than the general population}} frequency of 13 %- 15 %. It is significant that all <b>kindreds</b> identified to date are of Hispanic background with ancestors traced to the southern Colorado/northern New Mexico region.

5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. <b>Kindred</b> forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair genes MSH 2 and MLH 1 {{have been shown}} to account for a major share of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). We searched for germline mutations in these genes in 35 HNPCC <b>kindreds</b> fulfilling the Amsterdam diagnostic criteria and in a further 20 <b>kindreds</b> with an average of four affected members per family but not meeting the formal criteria. We first screened for truncations by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. If no mutation was found, we screened genomic DNA by a novel application of two-dimensional (2 -D) DNA electrophoresis that allows the simultaneous study of all exons of each gene. All abnormalities were followed up by sequencing. Eight different pathogenic germline mutations were found, two in MSH 2 and six in MLH 1. We report three major conclusions. First, these mutations together accounted for 86 % (30 / 35) of the <b>kindreds</b> meeting the Amsterdam criteria, but only 30 % (6 / 20) of the remaining <b>kindreds,</b> suggesting differences in etiology. Second, MLH 1 was involved in > 90 % (34 / 36) of <b>kindreds</b> with a known predisposing mutation, suggesting that mutations in the MLH 1 gene are responsible for most HNPCC <b>kindreds</b> in Finland. Third, our results indicate that the successive application of RT-PCR and 2 -D DNA electrophoresis is a sensitive and efficient method for mutation screening in typical HNPCC...|$|R

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern <b>kindred</b> who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The disease-bearing {{genes for}} hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) in HCM {{families have been}} identified as the beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-tropomyosin, and cardiac troponin T genes. Three HCM <b>kindreds</b> with three distinct point mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin gene had extensive clinical evaluations. DESIGN AND RESULTS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified products was used to capture each of the nine exons from the alpha-tropomyosin gene to identify mutations in 60 familial HCM patients. Two missense mutations in exon 2 (Ala 63 Val and Lys 70 Thr) and one missense mutation in exon 5 (Asp 175 Asn) were found in three unrelated HCM <b>kindreds.</b> These <b>kindreds</b> were the subject of clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies. The morphological appearance of HCM was similar in the three <b>kindreds.</b> All the patients had severe hypertrophy of the left ventricle with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy during the early stage of the disease, which gradually progressed to dilatation of the left ventricle. Moreover, these <b>kindreds</b> showed similar disease penetrance, age of onset, and incidence of premature sudden death. The disease in these <b>kindreds</b> was severe and resulted in frequent sudden deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese patients with familial HCM mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin gene are not as rare as reported, accounting for about 5 % of all cases. These mutations are characterised by hypertrophy of the left ventricle which then progresses to dilatation and a high incidence of sudden or disease-related death...|$|R
