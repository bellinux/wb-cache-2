5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, what is now NY394 from Westfield to Mayville, as well as from <b>Jamestown</b> to Steamburg, was designated as part of NY17, a cross-state highway extending across the Southern Tier from Westfield to New Jersey. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, an alternate route of NY17 from Mayville to <b>Jamestown</b> was designated as NY17J from Mayville to Ashville and part of NY74 from Ashville to <b>Jamestown.</b> In the mid-1930s, NY17J was extended eastward to rejoin NY17 at Washington Street in <b>Jamestown,</b> creating an overlap with NY74. This overlap was eliminated in the mid-1940s when NY74 was truncated to Ashville. NY17, meanwhile, was extended to Barcelona to meet NY5 by 1946.|$|E
5|$|As a British territory, {{the island}} follows the British {{education}} system. There is one primary school, serving children ages four to eleven, in <b>Jamestown,</b> Pilling Primary School, {{which was created}} by the amalgamation of <b>Jamestown</b> First School and Pilling Middle School in September 2007. The island's only secondary school is Prince Andrew School in Saint Paul's.|$|E
5|$|The {{segments}} of NY394 between Westfield and Mayville, {{as well as}} east of <b>Jamestown</b> were originally designated as NY17 in 1924. Six years later, the remainder of current NY394 gained a pair of designations {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, by the mid-1940s, the MayvilleJamestown stretch was solely designated as New York State Route17J. In November 1973, NY17 was realigned onto the new Southern Tier Expressway east of <b>Jamestown.</b> The former alignment of NY17 between <b>Jamestown</b> and Steamburg and all of NY17J were redesignated as NY394. NY394 was extended westward to Barcelona shortly afterward. Today the route is also concurrent with part of New York State Bicycle Route17.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the <b>Jamestown</b> colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jamestown</b> {{was founded}} in 1659 by the English East India Company and named after James, Duke of York, the future King James II of England. A fort, {{originally}} named the Castle of St John, was quickly built and, with {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, the fort was renamed James Fort, the town <b>Jamestown</b> and the valley James Valley. The fort and associated gun batteries dominated James Bay and were sporadically improved over the years. In January 1673 the Dutch East India Company briefly seized control of the island until the English East India Company recaptured it in May. Since then the town has been continuously inhabited under English and then British rule.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities NY430 {{runs through}} include (from west to east) {{the villages of}} Sherman and Mayville, the hamlet of Maple Springs, the village of Bemus Point {{and the city of}} <b>Jamestown.</b> Besides NY60, NY430 intersects with NY76 in Sherman and NY394 in Mayville. It meets the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17) {{multiple}} times: in Sherman via NY76, twice in Bemus Point (once by way of a short expressway designated as the unsigned NY954J and also via an interchange located southwest of NY954J), and in <b>Jamestown</b> via Strunk Road. NY430 also runs along the east side of Chautauqua Lake, and services both Long Point State Park and Midway Park.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route394 (NY394) is a {{state highway}} located within Cattaraugus and Chautauqua {{counties}} in southwestern New York in the United States. Its western terminus {{is located on the}} shore of Lake Erie at an intersection with NY5 in the Westfield hamlet of Barcelona. The eastern terminus is located at an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17) at the Coldspring hamlet of Steamburg. From Mayville to <b>Jamestown,</b> NY394 follows the western edge of Chautauqua Lake. East of <b>Jamestown,</b> the route straddles the Southern Tier Expressway and connects to the highway in four different locations, including at its eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route430 (NY430) is a {{state highway}} located entirely within Chautauqua County, New York, in the United States. Its western {{terminus}} {{is located at the}} Pennsylvania state line near the hamlet of Findley Lake in the town of Mina.

5|$|On 9 June, Missouri left Newport News {{for a tour}} of the Mediterranean, {{arriving}} back in New York on 17 December. She remained with the North Atlantic Fleet {{for the next three years}} conducting normal peacetime training. During this period, the fleet was renamed the Atlantic Fleet. Missouri assisted in relief work in Kingston, Jamaica from 17 to 19 January 1907, following a severe earthquake there. That April, she participated in the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition. The ceremonies were held to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the <b>Jamestown</b> colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.|$|E
5|$|South of the expressway, NY394 {{remains the}} primary lakeside roadway {{as it passes}} through the {{communities}} of Quigley Park and Cheney's Point. NY394 {{turns back to the}} southeast at an intersection with CR43, passing Edward F. Loomis Park and remaining on the now-southern edge of Chautauqua Lake. As the route approaches Lakewood, traffic generally becomes more dense and it intersects NY474, a largely rural roadway linking the <b>Jamestown</b> area to Wattsburg, Pennsylvania. NY394 continues onward through Lakewood and into <b>Jamestown,</b> where the lake comes to an end near an intersection with Jackson Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Parish of St. James {{is one of}} {{the three}} parishes of the Diocese of St Helena on the island. St James' Church is the primary church in the parish and is the oldest Anglican Church in the {{southern}} hemisphere; the present building was put up in 1772. There are 3 daughter churches: St John's, in Upper <b>Jamestown,</b> St Mary's, the Briars, and St Michael's, in Rupert's Valley.

5|$|The keel for Minnesota {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia on 27 October 1903. The {{completed}} hull was launched on 8 April 1905; at the launching ceremony she was christened by Rose Marie Schaller, {{the daughter of a}} member of the Minnesota Senate. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 9 March 1907, with Captain John Hubbard as her first commanding officer. The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise off the coast of New England before attending the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition, the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the <b>Jamestown</b> colony, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. She was present at the ceremony from 22 April to 3 September.|$|E
5|$|UND, founded 27 February 1883 (six {{years prior}} to North Dakota's statehood), is the state's oldest and longest {{operating}} post-secondary institution. University of <b>Jamestown</b> (UJ), founded under the name <b>Jamestown</b> College 31 October 1883 by the Presbyterian Church, is the state's second-oldest established post-secondary institution. Mayville State University (MSU), originally named Mayville Normal School, founded in 1889 by the first North Dakota Legislative Assembly, is the state's third-oldest established post-secondary institution but is the second longest operating school. NDSU, originally named the North Dakota Agricultural College, was founded 8 March 1890 {{as part of the}} Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890, is the state's fourth-oldest post-secondary institution and third longest operating school.|$|E
5|$|All five {{ships of}} the class served with the Atlantic Fleet for the {{majority}} of their careers. In 1907, Virginia, Georgia, and New Jersey took part in the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the <b>Jamestown</b> colony. The five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 190709, though Nebraska, which had been built on the west coast of the United States, joined the fleet after it had reached California in 1908. The fleet left Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 and steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|NY394, {{initially}} {{known as}} Sixth Street {{within the city}} limits, splits into a one-way pair after crossing the Chadakoin River. At this point, eastbound NY394 shifts one block south to follow Fifth Street while westbound NY394 remains on Sixth. Between Washington Street and North Main Street, NY394 is concurrent with NY60, with NY60 south overlapping NY394 west on Sixth Street and NY60 north overlapping NY394 east on Fifth. The one-way pair remains intact through downtown to Prendergast Avenue, where NY394 comes back together and shifts south onto Fourth Street. Two blocks later, NY394 veers onto Second Street and passes south of <b>Jamestown</b> Community College before exiting the city. The portion of NY394 within <b>Jamestown</b> from the western city line to Prendergast Avenue is maintained by the city {{and is the only}} section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Combs {{family was}} one of the oldest European {{families}} in the United States. John Combs, the family patriarch, arrived in <b>Jamestown,</b> Virginia in 1619, and in 1775 Benjamin John Combs came westward from Virginia into Clark County, Kentucky. He was followed into Kentucky in 1790 by two of his brothers, including Jack Combs, Bert Combs' great-grandfather.|$|E
5|$|The Florida Marlins {{selected}} Fernández in {{the first}} round, with the 14th overall selection, of the 2011 MLB draft. Fernández signed with the Marlins, receiving a $2million signing bonus. After he signed with the Marlins, he made one start for the Gulf Coast Marlins of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and one start for the <b>Jamestown</b> Jammers of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League.|$|E
5|$|The keel for New Jersey {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Fore River Shipyard on 3 May 1902. She was {{launched}} on 10 November 1904; the daughter of Franklin Murphy, then the Governor of New Jersey, christened the ship. She was commissioned into the US fleet on 12 May 1906, Captain William Kimball in command. New Jersey began her initial training in the Atlantic and Caribbean, which {{was interrupted by a}} naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay in September. On 21 September, the ship was deployed to Cuba {{to take part in the}} Second Occupation of Cuba; she remained there until 13 October. New Jersey participated in the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition from 15 April to 14 May 1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the <b>Jamestown</b> colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1907, she {{took part in the}} <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition and suffered an explosion in her aft 8-inch gun turret that killed or wounded 21men. At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training followed for the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's {{paternal}} {{ancestors were}} the Harrison family of Virginia, whose immigrant ancestor, Benjamin Harrison, arrived in <b>Jamestown,</b> Virginia, in 1630. Benjamin, the future president, {{was born on}} August 20, 1833, in North Bend, Ohio, the second of Elizabeth Ramsey (Irwin) and John Scott Harrison's eight children. Benjamin was also a grandson of U.S. President William Henry Harrison, the first governor of the Indiana Territory, and a great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison V, a Virginia planter who signed the Declaration of Independence and succeeded Thomas Jefferson as governor of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Operation Commando {{finally ended}} on 15 October with the US I Corps having {{successfully}} seized the <b>Jamestown</b> Line and destroying {{elements of the}} 42nd, 47th, 64th and 65th Chinese Armies. Chinese losses were estimated at 21,000 casualties, while UN losses were 4,000—the majority {{of them in the}} US 1st Cavalry Division which had borne the brunt of the fighting. Although a few hills south of the line remained in communist hands—requiring a follow-up operation known as Operation Polecharge which succeeded in capturing these positions by 19 October—UN supply lines near Seoul were now free from Chinese interdiction. With the peace-talks ongoing, these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months. It was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences, trench lines, bunkers, patrols, wiring parties and minefields reminiscent of the Western Front in 1915–17. Construction of defensive localities began almost immediately, although such operations were confined to the reverse slopes during the day due to artillery and mortar fire which made such operations hazardous. Patrolling forward of the <b>Jamestown</b> Line also began in order to prevent the Chinese from gaining control of no mans land. Yet even as the war became a contest of positional warfare and attrition, growing western political sensitivities ensured that UN commanders were increasingly mindful of limiting casualties.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{was born}} in <b>Jamestown,</b> New York, one of three sons of the {{president}} of a banknote-engraving company. He attended the City University of New York, and practiced law for about 25 years. During the American Civil War, Shepard was a Union Army recruiter and subsequently earned the rank of colonel. He was later a founder and benefactor of several institutions and banks. When Shepard moved to the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of Scarborough-on-Hudson, he founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church and built Woodlea; the house and its land are now part of Sleepy Hollow Country Club.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began when}} the large and {{unwieldy}} CSS Virginia steamed into Hampton Roads {{on the morning of}} March 8, 1862. Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible. Virginia was accompanied from her moorings on the Elizabeth River by Raleigh and Beaufort, and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron, Patrick Henry, <b>Jamestown,</b> and Teaser. When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News, Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by a shot in her boiler that killed four of her crew. After repairs, she returned and rejoined the others.|$|E
5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} {{through the}} use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of <b>Jamestown</b> Group, owners of One Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Under James the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began, and the English {{colonisation}} of North America {{started its}} {{course with the}} foundation of <b>Jamestown,</b> Virginia, in 1607, and Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland, in 1610. During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France {{for control of the}} continent, while religious division in Ireland between Protestant and Catholic has lasted for 400 years. By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms, he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.|$|E
5|$|Virginia then {{proceeded}} to Norfolk, where she coaled before continuing on to Tompkinsville, Staten Island. She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have the bottom of her hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire control device was installed between 19 February and 23 March. Virginia then returned to Cuba, arriving in Guantanamo Bay on 28 March. She conducted gunnery training off Cuba until 10 April, when she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she remained from 15 April to 15 May. During this period, she participated in the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the <b>Jamestown</b> colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event. In mid-May, when she went into the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, which lasted into early June. From 7 to 13 June, she took part in a naval review for Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. Target practice followed off Cape Cod Bay from mid-June to mid-July. Virginia and the rest of her division then cruised the east coast, stopping in Newport, New York City, and Provincetown, followed by night battle training in Cape Cod Bay.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} upgrades at the New York Navy Yard, {{including the}} addition of smoke ejectors, Kentucky joined the North Atlantic Squadron. The battleship participated in the welcome of the British North Atlantic Squadron at Annapolis, Maryland, in October 1905. During the 1906 Cuban Insurrection, she carried Marines to Cuba, embarking them from Provincetown on 23 September, and landing them at Havana, Cuba, on 1 October. She remained there until 9 October, {{and then returned to}} New England. Kentucky attended the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition at Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 April 1907, and then participated in exercises off the New England coast.|$|E
5|$|Canonicus {{arrived at}} the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 June 1869 and was {{decommissioned}} five days later. The ship was renamed Scylla on 15 June 1869, but resumed her former name on 10 August 1869. She was recommissioned on 22 January 1872, and cruised the coastal waters of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico whenever she was in commission. Canonicus was finally decommissioned in 1877 at Pensacola, Florida. The elderly monitor was towed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, in mid-1907 as an exhibit during the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition as the last survivor of the Civil War monitors. Canonicus was sold for scrap on 19 February 1908.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} a new limited-access highway through Cattaraugus and Chautauqua {{counties}} (part of the modern Southern Tier Expressway) in the mid-1960s. The initial section of the highway, extending from Kennedy (exit14) to Randolph (exit16), opened to traffic by 1967 and became part of a rerouted NY17 in the late 1960s. By November 1973, the expressway had been extended west to Fluvanna (exit11) and east to Steamburg (exit 17). NY17 was then realigned to follow the expressway while its former routing from <b>Jamestown</b> to Steamburg, {{as well as all}} of NY17J, was redesignated as NY394. By 1977, the Southern Tier Expressway was completed up to exit10 in Bemus Point.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
5|$|Etruria {{spent her}} early {{career with the}} main fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. In the early 1900s, she {{spent much of her}} time in North and South American waters; she visited the United States for the <b>Jamestown</b> Exposition and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1907 and 1909. The ship took part in the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, {{primarily}} by providing gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa. Reduced to a training ship by World War I, Etruria was deliberately sunk by the Regia Marina in Livorno to convince Austria-Hungary that its espionage network had not been compromised by double agents.|$|E
5|$|From 19 January 1952, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was in defence on the <b>Jamestown</b> Line {{as part of}} the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade {{before going}} into reserve on 18 April, where they {{remained}} until the end of June. Meanwhile, in early 1952 the Australian government had agreed to an American request to increase its forces in Korea, dispatching a second infantry battalion to join 3 RAR which had been fighting since September 1950. The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) arrived in Korea on 6 April 1952, with both battalions forming part of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade under the command of an Australian brigadier. The brigade re-entered the line on 30 June and 1 RAR spent the following fourteen weeks patrolling, ambushing and raiding, before the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade again went into reserve on 5 October. The brigade returned to the <b>Jamestown</b> Line in early November, with 1 RAR taking over the defences on Hill 355 from the Canadians. The Australians were subsequently forced to clean up large quantities of rubbish left by the Canadians as well as repairing and camouflaging the defences which had recently been attacked by the Chinese. 1 RAR implemented an aggressive patrol program in an effort to regain control of no-man's land from the Chinese, which had been allowed to establish hides close to the perimeter. Several Chinese outposts were subsequently destroyed during raids of up to company-size.|$|E
5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of <b>Jamestown,</b> but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|In 1607, after {{a voyage}} of 144 days, three ships headed by Captain Christopher Newport, and {{carrying}} 105 men and boys, made their first landfall in the New World on the mainland, where the southern {{mouth of the}} Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. They named it Cape Henry, after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James I of England. These English colonists of the Virginia Company of London moved on from this area, as they were under orders to seek a site further inland, which would be more sheltered from ships of competing European countries. They created their first permanent settlement {{on the north side}} of the James River at <b>Jamestown.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of <b>Jamestown</b> {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 {{he visited}} <b>Jamestown</b> to inspect, equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment, his first return since infancy, and was welcomed {{by a group}} of {{prominent}} citizens. Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment, New York Volunteers, which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor. George W. Whitman, brother of the poet Walt Whitman {{and a member of the}} regiment, was notified by Shepard of a promotion; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to major in 1865. In addition, Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman. Although President Abraham Lincoln offered him a promotion to brigadier general, Shepard declined in deference to officers who had seen field service; Shepard himself never entered the field. From 1866 to 1868 Shepard served as aide-de-camp to Reuben E. Fenton.|$|E
