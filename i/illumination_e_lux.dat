40|$|In the {{particle}} model, light {{is assumed to}} be composed of photons originating at the light sources and moving within the environment, possibly getting scattered by the medium and refracted or re ected by the objects in the environment until they are eventually absorbed. Using Monte Carlo methods for simulating the behaviour and keeping track of a su ciently large sample of photons in the environment, <b>illumination</b> <b>e</b> ects can be estimated. In this paper we rst describe the algorithm used for Monte Carlo simulation and show how the results are used for computing global <b>illumination</b> <b>e</b> ects and for synthesising realistic images. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that as the simulation progresses, with increasing number of samples, the computed illumination is progressively re ned. A detailed comparative performance analysis with a straightforward implementation of the radiosity method shows that the results are equally good and the computation times comparable. The major advantages over the other well established methods of ray tracing and radiosity stem from the fact that complex environmental behaviour can be more easily accommodated. In particular we discuss techniques for dealing with complex extended light sources and large unevenly lighted surfaces without any need for apriori discretisation, and the issues related to the rendering of non di use environments. Finally we describe a variation in the simulation algorithm for variance reduction and compare the results with the earlier algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{polarized}} infrared emission by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), when anisotropically illuminated by UV photons. PAH molecules are modeled as planar disks with in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational dipoles. As first {{pointed out by}} Leger (1988), infrared emission features resulting from in-plane and out-of-plane modes should have orthogonal polarization directions. We show analytically how the degree of polarization depends on the viewing geometry and the molecule’s internal alignment between principal axis of inertia and angular momentum, which gets worse after photon absorption. Longer wavelength features, emitted after better internal alignment is recovered, should be more strongly polarized. The degree of polarization for uni-directional <b>illumination</b> (<b>e.</b> g., by a star) is larger than for diffuse <b>illumination</b> (<b>e.</b> g., by a disk galaxy), all else being equal. For PAHs in the Cold Neutral Medium, the predicted polarization is probably too small to distinguish from the contribution of linear dichroism by aligned foreground dust. The level of polarization predicted for PAH emission from the Orion Bar is only ≈ 0. 06 % at 3. 3 µm; Sellgren et al. (1988) report a much larger value, 0. 86 ± 0. 28 %, {{which suggests that the}} smallest PAHs may have moderately suprathermal rotation rates. Future observations of (or upper limits on) the degree of polarization for the Orion Bar or for dust above edge-on galaxies (e. g., NGC 891 or M 82) may constrain the internal alignment of emitting PAHs, thus providing clues to their rotational dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Properties {{of quantum}} states have {{disclosed}} new technologies, ranging from quantum information to quantum metrology. Among them a recent research field is quantum imaging, addressed to overcome limits of classical imaging by exploiting spatial properties of quantum states of light. In particular quantum correlations between twin beams represent a fundamental resource for these studies. One {{of the most}} interesting proposed scheme exploits spatial quantum correlations between parametric down conversion light beams for realizing sub-shot-noise imaging of the weak absorbing objects, leading ideally to a noise-free imaging. Here we present the first experimental realisation of this scheme, showing its capability to reach a larger signal to noise ratio (SNR) with respect to classical imaging methods.

However, the quality of the acquired 3 D models is often impaired by color seams in the re-construction due to varying <b>illumination</b> (<b>e.</b> g., shadows or highlights) and object surfaces whose brightness and color vary with the viewpoint of the camera. In this paper, we propose a direct and simple method to estimate the pure albedo of the texture, which allows us to remove illumina-tion effects from IR and color images. Our approach first computes the illumination-independent albedo in the IR do-main, which we subsequently transfer to the color albedo. As shadows and highlights lead to over- and underexposed image regions with little or no color information, we apply an advanced optimization scheme to infer color informa-tion in the color albedo from neighboring image regions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to vari-ous real-world scenes. 1...|$|R

First, a closed-form expression is derived for the irradiance Jacobian, which is the derivative of a vector eld representing radiant energy ux. The expression holds for di use polygonal scenes and correctly accounts for shadowing, or partial occlusion. Three applications of the irradiance Jacobian are demonstrated: locat-ing local irradiance extrema, direct computation of isolux contours, and surface mesh generation. Next, the concept of irradiance is generalized to tensors of arbitrary order. A recurrence relation for irradiance tensors is derived that extends a widely used formula published by Lambert in 1760.

40|$|Isoforms of ankyrin (ankyrinsR) immunologically {{related to}} {{erythrocyte}} ankyrin (ankyrinRo) {{are associated with}} distinct neuronal plasma membrane domains of functional importance, such as cell bodies and dendrites, axonal hillock and initial segments, and nodes of Ranvier. AnkyrinRo is expressed in brain, and accounts {{for at least one}} of the ankyrinR isoforms. Another ankyrin isoform of brain, ankyrinB, is encoded by a distinct gene and is immunologically distinct from ankyrinsR. Mutant mice with normoblastosis (nb/nb) constitute the first described genetic model of ankyrin deficiency: they display a severe hemolytic anemia due to a significantly reduced expression of the ankyrinRo gene in reticulocytes as well as brain (Peters L. L., C. S. Birkenmeier, R. T. Bronson, R. A. White, S. <b>E.</b> <b>Lux,</b> <b>E.</b> Otto, V. Bennett, A. Higgins, and J. E. Barker. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 114 : 1233 - 1241). In the present report, we distinguish between ankyrinRo and other ankyrinR isoforms using immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence localization of ankyrinsR throughout the nervous system (forebrain, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve) of nb/nb and normal mice. This is the first immunocytochemical characterization of the neurological component of the nb mutation and shows the following. (a) The isoform of ankyrin at the nodes of Ranvier and initial axonal segments is present in the nb/nb mice and does not cross-react with an ankyrinRo-specific antibody; this isoform, therefore, is distinct from both ankyrin isoforms identified in brain, ankyrinRo and ankyrinB, and is probably the product of a distinct gene and a unique component of the specialized membrane skeleton associated with nodes of Ranvier. (b) AnkyrinRo missing from nb/nb mice is selectively associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, excluded from myelinated axons, and displays a selective pattern of expression in the nervous system whereby expression is almost ubiquitous in neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells) and spinal cord, and restricted to a very minor subset of neurons in hippocampus and neocortex of forebrain...|$|R

It is shown that the thermodynamical model obeys general scaling laws and corresponds to the degenerate class of scale-invariant statistics. We also find that its structure function shapes have physical behaviors similar to the log-Poisson’s one. The only difference between them lies in the convergence of the log-Poisson’s structure functions and divergence of the thermodynamical one. As far as the comparison with experiments on intermittency is concerned, they are indifferent. @ 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

The changes of consumer behavior, which influenced by the economy crisis occurred in Indonesia, has suppressed the producers to readjust their marketing programs. It is crucial for the firms to recognize  the consumer attitudes on their products in making their marketing programs. The study was aimed at understanding: (1) the consumer attitudes on the bath soaps’ (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>Lux</b> and Giv brands) attributes, (2) the influence of the consumer’s social environment toward the subjective norm in making the purchasing decision on the Lux and Giv, (3) the differential of consumers attitudes on the Lux and Giv. Interview and questionnaire were used to collect data, by using the semantic differential scale method. Fishbein model and Wilcoxon’s signed rank test were applied to test the study’s results. Results of the study showed that: (1) there was a positive attitude of consumer on both the Lux and Giv. “Aroma”, whereas “prestige” had the lowest positive score for the Giv; (2) the consumer’s social environment influenced the subjective norms of consumer in making the purchasing decision of the Lux and Giv. “Family members” was the dominant variable of both the Lux and Giv; (3) there were the differences in the consumer attitude between the Lux and Giv brands. By the differential test for each attribute, then, it was showed that there were the significant differences in the consumer attitude on the product’s attributes,  except for the “packaging”. Based on the study results and empirical evidences supported by the statistical testing,  it is showed that the two bath soap brands have dominate the consumer’s mind. Nevertheless, in making their purchasing decision, the consumers have the difference attitudes in assesing those two brands depends on their desires.

40|$|Daylight in {{buildings}} {{is the natural}} illumination experienced by the occupants of any man- made construction with openings to the outside. The {{quantity and quality of}} daylight {{in buildings}} is continually varying due to the natural changes in sun and sky conditions from one moment to the next. In urban settings, the dynamics of daylight illumination are ampli ed by the vertical extent of buildings and the density of the built form. Traditional schema for evaluating daylight in the built environment consider only one or perhaps a few `snapshot' conditions, e. g. a single overcast sky, or a sequence of shadow patterns for selected hours. This chapter describes the application of a technique called climate-based daylight modelling (CBDM) across various urban scales from o ce spaces to large- scale city models. Climate-based daylight modelling is the prediction of various radiant or luminous quantities (e. g. irradiance, illuminance, radiance and luminance) using sun and sky conditions that are derived from standard meteorological datasets. Climate- based modelling delivers predictions of absolute quantities (e. g. illuminance) that are dependent both on the locale (i. e. geographically-speci c climate data is used) and the building orientation (i. <b>e.</b> the <b>illumination</b> <b>e</b> ect of the sun and non-overcast sky conditions are included), in addition to the building's composition and con guration.

40|$|There are situations, where video {{surveillance}} based on automated scene change detection systems {{may prove to}} be ineffective. In some cases, the changes in the image are too small to be properly detected. In others, false alarms are generated without objects (or people) moving. These alarms may be caused by changes in <b>illumination,</b> <b>e.</b> g., a faulty lamp or spurious reflections in places near water pools. Further, the absence of illumination during a blackout (whether it is caused by accident or on purpose) prevents cameras from their surveillance operation. There are high security installations for which it is necessary to introduce reliable, independent and effective sensors that can keep the surveillance work even during a blackout. Laser range scanners are electronic instruments measuring the distance from the instrument itself to the outside world along a specific direction. The type of the instrument to use depends on the range of distances to measure. The deflection of the laser beam (e. g., using a rotating mirror) enables the acquisition of the distance profiles of the surrounding premises in a very short time.

Such percepts are partly based on the way physical surfaces and media reflect and transmit light and partly on the way the human visual system processes the complex patterns of light reaching the eye. One way to understand how these percepts arise is to assume that the visual system parses patterns of light into layered perceptual representations of surfaces, illumination and atmospheric media, one seen through another. Despite a great deal of previous experimental and modelling work on layered representation, however, a unified computational model of key perceptual demonstrations is still lacking. Here we present the first general computational model of perceptual layering and surface appearance [...] based on a boarder theoretical framework called gamut relativity [...] that is consistent with these demonstrations.

40|$|ABSTRACT Frog rod outer {{segments}} swell slowly {{after being}} shaken from an excised retina into a modified Ringer's solution. The swelling has the following characteristics: (a) It is suppressed by illumination which bleaches only 500 rhodopsin molecules per outer segment per second. This is approximately the level required to saturate the in vivo receptor potential. (b) Light suppression {{is seen in}} NaCI but not in KC 1 solutions. (c) Dark swelling is labile and is enhanced by calf serum, low calcium concentrations, dithiothreitol, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors. (d) Lowering the pH to 5. 5 or removing magnesium reversibly reduces dark swelling {{to the same extent}} as <b>illumination.</b> (<b>e)</b> The amount of light required for maximal suppression of dark swelling increases approximately 10 -fold if the calcium concentration is lowered by EGTA addition. (f) The effect of illumination is irreversibly abolished by antimycin and other inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport. (g) A process analogous to dark adaptation in vivo can be observed: If 10 - 50 % of the rhodopsin present is bleached and the outer segments are then kept dark, rapid dark swelling returns after a period of 15 - 45 min. This swelling is again sensitive to light. We tentatively ascribe the light suppression of swelling to the same decrease in sodium permeability which is observed on illuminating living receptor cells. The experiments suggest that outer segments retain their competence to perform both transduction and dark adaptation after their separation from the retina...|$|R

As a result of this relationship the potential of flexible textilebased sensor constructions which might be used for the identification of radiation intensity is demonstrated. In addition the differences between photochromic pigment behaviour in solution and incorporated into prints on textiles are demonstrated. Differences in the effect of the spectral power distributions of light sources on the photochromic response are also examined. Bi-exponential functions, which are used in optical yield (Oy) calculations, have been described to provide a good description of the kinetics of colour change intensity of photochromic pigments, giving a good fit. The optical yield of the photochromic reaction Oy is linearly related to the intensity of <b>illumination</b> <b>E.</b> The optical yield obtained from the photochromic reaction curves are described by a kinetic model, which defines the rate of colour change initiated by external stimulus of UV light.

40|$|The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) {{nighttime}} visible channel {{was designed}} to detect earth–atmosphere features under conditions of low <b>illumination</b> (<b>e.</b> g., near the solar terminator or via moonlight reflection). However, this sensor also detects visible light emissions from various terrestrial sources (both natural and anthropogenic), including lightning-illuminated thunder-storm tops. This research presents an automated technique for objectively identifying and enhancing the bright steaks associated with lightning flashes, even {{in the presence of}} lunar illumination, derived from OLS imagery. A line-directional filter is applied to the data in order to identify lightning strike features and an associated false color imagery product enhances this information while minimizing false alarms. Comparisons of this satellite product to U. S.
