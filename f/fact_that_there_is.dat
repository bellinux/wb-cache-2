5|$|The primary aims {{of therapy}} are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications {{used in the}} management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many people, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} stems from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> almost as much meat in large juveniles {{as there is in}} adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
60|$|Probyn smiled, for his {{recklessness}} was, perhaps, partly {{accounted for}} by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> what is usually termed good blood in him.|$|R

5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaching}} its conclusion, {{each of the}} seven Justices issued a separate opinion. Combining this with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little case law referencing section 117, there remains significant debate over {{the nature and extent of}} the right contained within it.|$|E

25|$|Although Hong Kong {{legislative}} geographical constituencies {{are elected}} by proportional representation, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one vacancy turns it effectively into a first-past-the-post race.

25|$|The kinetic {{relationship}} with the other substrate, MgATP, can be described by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an affinity at about 0.3–0.4mmol/L, well below a typical intracellular concentration of 2.5mmol/L. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nearly always an excess of ATP available implies that ATP concentration rarely influences glucokinase activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of biased urn models {{is complicated by}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more than one noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Which distribution you get depends on whether items (e.g. colored balls) are sampled one by one in a manner where there is competition between the items, or they are sampled independently of each other.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why births go unregistered, {{including}} social and cultural beliefs and attitudes; alternative documents and naming ceremonies; remote areas, poor infrastructure; economic barriers; lack of office staff, equipment and training; legal and political restrictions; fear of discrimination and persecution; war, conflict and unrest or simply the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no system in place.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, victims drown quietly {{underwater}} without alerting {{anyone to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a problem and}} are typically found on the bottom {{as shown in the}} staged image at the right. Survivors of shallow water blackout are typically puzzled as to why they blacked out. Pool lifesavers are trained to scan the bottom for the situation shown.|$|E
25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance. The first is about the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> climate change {{and that it is}} human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{the factor}} [...] {{in the third}} line {{corresponds}} to the partition 2 + 2 of the integer 4, (4, because we are finding the fourth derivative), while [...] corresponds to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two summands (2 + 2) in that partition.

25|$|While {{they are}} {{retrieving}} the amber, the Observers, alerted {{by the black}} market dealer, arrive. Though they safely escape with Olivia, Walter is captured and taken to a secure Observer facility, where Captain Windmark (Michael Kopsa) arrives to interrogate him. Windmark starts violently probing Walter's mind. He taunts Walter with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no music in this future, that nothing will grow from the scorched earth. On continued probing, Windmark discovers the fragmented memories and attempts to obtain the memories by any means possible.|$|E
25|$|When {{preliminary}} nibbana with substrate occurs (that is, nibbana of {{a living}} being), constructive consciousness, that is, the house-builder, is completely destroyed and no new formations will be constructed. However, sankharas {{in the sense of}} constructed consciousness, which exists as a 'karmically-resultant-consciousness' (vipāka viññāna), continue to exist. Each liberated individual produces no new karma, but preserves a particular individual personality which {{is the result of the}} traces of his or her karmic heritage. The very <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a psycho-physical substrate during the remainder of an arahant's lifetime shows the continuing effect of karma.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{the study}} of {{perception}} as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (le corps propre) {{is not only a}} thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of domains as structural building blocks and elements of evolution {{has brought about}} many automated methods for their identification and classification in proteins of known structure. Automatic procedures for reliable domain assignment {{is essential for the}} generation of the domain databases, especially as the number of known protein structures is increasing. Although the boundaries of a domain can be determined by visual inspection, construction of an automated method is not straightforward. Problems occur when faced with domains that are discontinuous or highly associated. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no standard definition of what a domain really is has meant that domain assignments have varied enormously, with each researcher using a unique set of criteria.|$|E
