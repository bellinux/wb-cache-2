50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{lines of}} flux have {{to attract and}} pull the armature in contact with it to complete engagement. Most industrial couplings use {{what is called a}} single flux, two pole design (A-2). Mobile clutches of other specialty electromagnetic clutches can use a double or triple flux rotor (A-4). The double or trip flux refers to the number of north/south flux paths (A-6), in the rotor and armature. These slots (banana slots) (A-7) create an air gap which causes the flux path to take {{the path of least resistance}} when the faces are engaged. This means that, if the armature is designed properly and has similar banana slots, what occurs is a leaping of the flux path, which goes north south, north south (A-6). By having more points of contact, the torque can be greatly increased. In theory, if there were 2 sets of poles at the same diameter, the torque would double in a clutch. Obviously, that is not possible to do, so the points of contact have to be at a smaller inner diameter. Also, there are magnetic flux losses because of the bridges between the banana slots. But by using a <b>double</b> <b>flux</b> design, a 30%-50% increase in torque, can be achieved, and by using a triple flux design, a 40%-90% in torque can be achieved. This is important in applications where size and weight are critical, such as automotive requirements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{performance}} analysis of <b>double</b> stator axial <b>flux</b> permanent magnet generators for rim-driven marine current turbines (MCT). Indeed for submarine applications, drive train reliability is a key feature to reduce maintenance requirements. Rim-driven direct-drive multi-stator generators can therefore be a very interesting solution to improve this reliability. In this context, the presented work focus {{on the design of}} a double-stator axial flux permanent magnets (PM) generator as a rim-driven direct-drive multi-stator generator. The paper details the models, specifications and an optimization procedure that allow to preliminary design these kind of generators for rim-driven marine turbines. Thereafter, validations with finite elements computations and performance analysis considering particular design of rim driven generators are presented. The obtained results highlight some designs issues of PM generators for rim driven marine turbines. In order to assess the effectiveness of the <b>double</b> stator axial <b>flux</b> PM generator, a comparison with a designed surface mounted radial flux PM generator for rim marine turbines is carried out [...] The comparison highlights that the <b>double</b> stator axial <b>flux</b> generator presents a better cooling and a reduced active parts cost and mass than the radial flux PM generator.

40|$|The major {{processes}} {{discussed below}} are protein turnover (degradation and synthesis), degradation into urea, or conversion into glucose (gluconeogenesis, Figure 1). Daily protein turnover {{is a dynamic}} process characterized by a <b>double</b> <b>flux</b> of amino acids: the amino acids released by endogenous (body) protein breakdown can be reutilized and reconverted to protein synthesis, with very little loss. Daily rates of protein turnover in humans (300 to 400 g per day) are largely {{in excess of the}} level of protein intake (50 to 80 g per day). A fast growing rate, as in premature babies or in children recovering from malnutrition, leads to a high protein turnover rate and a high protein and energy requirement. Protein metabolism (synthesis and breakdown) is an energy-requiring process, dependent upon endogenous ATP supply. The contribution made by whole-body protein turnover to the resting metabolic rate is important: it represents about 20 % in adults and more in growing children. Metabolism of proteins cannot be disconnected from that of energy since energy balance influences net protein utilization, and since protein intake has an important effect on postprandial thermogenesis - more important than that of fats or carbohydrates. The metabolic need for amino acids is essentially to maintain stores of endogenous tissue proteins within an appropriate range, allowing protein homeostasis to be maintained. Thanks to a dynamic, free amino acid pool, this demand for amino acids can be continuously supplied. The size of the free amino acid pool remains limited and is regulated within narrow limits. The supply of amino acids to cover physiological needs can be derived from 3 sources: 1. Exogenous proteins that release amino acids after digestion and absorption 2. Tissue protein breakdown during protein turnover 3. De novo synthesis, including amino acids (as well as ammonia) derived from the process of urea salvage, following hydrolysis and microflora metabolism in the hind gut. When protein intake surpasses the physiological needs of amino acids, the excess amino acids are disposed of by three major processes: 1. Increased oxidation, with terminal end products such as CO₂ and ammonia 2. Enhanced ureagenesis i. e. synthesis of urea linked to protein oxidation eliminates the nitrogen radical 3. Gluconeogenesis, i. e. de novo synthesis of glucose. Most of the amino groups of the excess amino acids are converted into urea through the urea cycle, whereas their carbon skeletons are transformed into other intermediates, mostly glucose. This is one of the mechanisms, essential for life, developed by the body to maintain blood glucose within a narrow range, (i. e. glucose homeostasis). It includes the process of gluconeogenesis, i. e. de novo synthesis of glucose from non-glycogenic precursors; in particular certain specific amino acids (for example, alanine), as well as glycerol (derived from fat breakdown) and lactate (derived from muscles). The gluconeogenetic pathway progressively takes over when the supply of glucose from exogenous or endogenous sources (glycogenolysis) becomes insufficient. This process becomes vital during periods of metabolic stress, such as starvation...|$|E
40|$|The {{balance of}} primary {{production}} and decomposition in northern peatlands may shift due to climate change, with potential feedbacks to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Nitrogen availability will modulate this shift, but {{little is known}} about the drivers of soil nitrogen dynamics in these environments. We used a long-term (9 years) open top chamber (OTC) experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog in sub-arctic Sweden, to test for the interactive effects of spring warming, summer warming and winter snow addition on soil nitrogen fluxes, potential activities of nitrogen cycle enzymes, and soil microbial community composition. These simultaneous measurements allowed us to identify the level of organization at which climate change impacts are apparent, an important requirement for developing truly mechanistic understanding. Organic-N pools and fluxes were an order of magnitude higher than inorganic-N pools and fluxes. Summer warming approximately <b>doubled</b> <b>fluxes</b> of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia over the growing season. Such a large increase under 1 degrees C warming is unlikely to be due to kinetic effects, and we propose that it is linked to an observed seasonal decrease in microbial biomass, suggesting that N flux is driven by a substantial late-season dieback of microbes. This change in N cycle dynamics was not reflected in any of the measured potential peptidase activities. Moreover, the soil microbial community structure was apparently stable across treatments, suggesting a non-specific microbial dieback. Our results show that in these widespread peat bogs, where many plant species are capable of organic-N uptake, organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively far more important than the commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics. Understanding of climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in this system will be advanced by closer investigation of the seasonal dynamics of the microbial biomass and the input of substrates that maintain it. ...|$|R

A quantum simulation of the time evolution of the system indeed suggests that the observed anomalous behavior can be imputable to quantum coherence effects.

These dual AGNs have a separation distance at ∼ 1 kpc scale, showing an intermediate phase of merging systems. The appearance of dual AGNs is about ∼ 10 ^- 2, impacting on the current observational deficit of binary supermassive black holes with a probability of ∼ 10 ^- 4 (Boroson & Lauer).
