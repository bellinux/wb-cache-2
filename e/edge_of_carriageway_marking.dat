50|$|Percy Shaw, of Halifax (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire) {{invented the}} cat's eye. Reflecting Roadstuds {{was set up}} a year later in 1935. It {{required}} £500 from two company directors and established a 20 acre manufacturing site with 130 workers, later making a million roadstuds a year. Initially {{it was difficult for}} the company to sell their new idea to road constructors and the government. However the onset of the blackout in the Second World War saw the idea being adopted throughout the United Kingdom. By the 1960s, its products were used on lane markings, then on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriageways</b> from the early 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Loading and {{unloading}} {{is allowed}} on double yellow lines at any time, {{unless there are}} additional markings indicating that there are 'loading restrictions'. Two short yellow stripes at regular intervals across the kerb or <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway</b> indicate that loading and unloading is not permitted at any time (these are not accompanied by sign plates). A single short yellow stripe at regular intervals across the kerb or <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway</b> indicates that loading and unloading is not permitted at the times shown on accompanying black and white sign plates. Loading/unloading time is restricted to either 20 or 40 minutes depending upon the location (borough) if loading is observed. One must not cause an obstruction to traffic or pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|Double yellow {{lines on}} the side of the road have a similar meaning (no parking at any time) as in the United Kingdom.

40|$|This report investigates three {{specific}} {{aspects of}} highway maintenance where data is required to enable Engineers to improve the effectiveness of design methodology. TI 1 e {{major part of the}} report is concerned with the development of a model based on the design charts included within the Department of Transport Overlay Design Method. The model, developed for use on a Commodore Pet Microcomputer of 32 kilobyte capacity, enables Engineers to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the design method to identify the most likely structural condition and the most effective strengthening solution. This report analysis and summarises the effects of errors in the major design inputs to the design method. The effects of sampling procedures in the determination of pavement strength from deflection measurements is also considered. The present technique uses a Deflectograph to obtain a complete population of deflection values. Other techniques (eg. Deflection Beam) could prove an effective alternative if suitable sampling procedures could be designed. Unfortunately this report does not provide such sampling precedures. The deflection data does not compare with well known distributions and samples have had to be analysed using nonparametric techniques. In addition, the investigation {{of a wide range of}} deflection data has shown that sample estimates vary significantly, in terms of highway maintenance consequences from the population value. The final section of the report is concerned with assessing the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriageway</b> markings in reducing the rate <b>of</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>carriageways.</b> It might be anticipated that the use of such markings would guide vehicles away from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway,</b> thereby reducing edge deterioration. 'The results of this investigation do not support this view and give some indication that edge lining may increase edge deterioration by guiding vehicles to use more of the total width of the road.

40|$|In this thesis, I have {{analysed}} {{the section}} of a local road, which connects the city Grosuplje with the village Ponova vas. The thesis contains {{a description of the}} current status and possible technical solutions. I have obtained information about fluidity pressures of the intersection by manual counting of traffic, than I have calculated fluidity pressures of the roundabout. I have replaced the existing π intersection with the roundabout. On the whole route, lanes should be expanded to 2. 75 m. The entire route contains reconstructed pedestrian walkway along the left <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway,</b> roadside lighting, and drains to drain rainwater. I have placed two bus stops and two bus waiting places with a roof {{on each side of the}} roadway. Given the level of alignment in the horizontal plane, a road permits higher speeds than the permissible. Therefore, I have put traffic-calming measures with the splitter island on a flat route section. The entire route has got traffic signs and markings on the road...|$|R
2500|$|Countries {{party to}} the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic have uniform rules about {{overtaking}} and lane designation. [...] The convention details (amongst other things) that [...] "Every driver shall keep to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway</b> appropriate to the direction of traffic", and the [...] "Drivers overtaking shall do so on the side opposite to that appropriate to the direction of traffic", notwithstanding {{the presence or absence}} of oncoming traffic. Allowed exceptions to these rules include turning or heavy traffic, traffic in lines, or situation in which signs or markings must dictate otherwise. These rules must be more strictly adhered to on roads with oncoming traffic, but still apply on multi-lane and divided highways. Many countries in Europe are {{party to the}} Vienna Conventions on traffic and roads.

50|$|After {{crossing}} the border into Cumbria, the A69 by-passes the town of Brampton, before coming to a roundabout junction with the A689 road. The A69 turns left here, and travels through the village of Warwick Bridge, which is planned to be by-passed in the future. Following a short piece <b>of</b> dual <b>carriageway,</b> the A69 comes to Junction 43 of the M6 motorway, which skirts the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Carlisle.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of road marking on {{residential}} roads outside the built-up area is emerging; a marked driving strip for motor vehicles. The border marking is situated several decimetres from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the road surface. By this means there exists an outside edge strip between the marking and the road surface edge {{that could be used}} by cyclists (and the occasional pedestrian). Between the outside edge strips on either side <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway,</b> there exists a driving strip without an axis line. The driving strip aims to: (i) lower the driving speeds by means of a visual narrowing of the carriageway; (ii) provide the cyclists their own safe place on the <b>carriageway</b> by <b>marking</b> the driving strip; and (iii) cause less damage by motor vehicles to the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carriageway</b> and shoulder. The question is whether the marked driving strip achieves these positive aims. An answer to this question was sought by means of inspections, observations, and measurements on a number of roads, with and without these driving strips. Outside edge strips occur on narrower roads than where the Dutch Centre for Research and Contract Standardization and Traffic Engineering CROW proposed them. CROW maintains that outside edge strips {{on both sides of the}} road should have a minimum width of 1. 25 metres, and that the road itself should be at least 5. 5 metres wide. Almost all the roads found and used in this study are narrower. All the outside edge strips found were also narrower. For the purposes of this study, the different edge strip widths were subdivided into three classes: narrower than 80 centimetres, 80 - 95 centimetres, and broader than 95 centimetres. In fact, all three classes consist <b>of</b> ‘narrow’ <b>edge</b> strips. Speed measurements did not show that cars drove considerably slower on roads with outside edge strips than on roads without them. The speed differences found were small and showed an unsystematic, unclear pattern. The space between an overtaking motor vehicle and a cyclist is at its smallest when no outside edge strips have been provided. Only a small percentage of cyclists cycle outside the edge strips; a maximum of c. 11 % in the case of those cycling alone. On roads with broad outside edge strips, and to a lesser extent on roads with narrow edge strips, the cyclists swerve less when being overtaken, than on roads without edge strips. The narrower the edge strip the more the cyclists swerve to the right. The narrow edge strips would appear to offer the cyclists their own place less than broader edge strips. In the most cases where the shoulder was used, there were one or more agricultural vehicles or lorries involved. In the most cases where vehicle were observed using the shoulder while swerving, were on roads without outside edge strips. The roads, however, also have a narrower hardened road surface than the roads that do have edge strips. Edge strips would appear not to result in motor vehicles driving closer to the middle of the road. The high speed limit (80 km/h) and the sometimes even higher measured driving speeds of cars and lorries, and the slow speeds of cyclists, lead to great differences in speed and mass. This is in conflict with the principles of ‘sustainably safe’. Even if the speed limit was to be reduced from 80 km/h to 60 km/h, the expected differences in speed are still great. The new type appears to have only small effects. Based on the data in this study, it has not become clear that the introduction <b>of</b> outside <b>edge</b> strips, on its own, is a sufficiently effective means of achieving the goals aimed at.
