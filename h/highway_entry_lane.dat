An empirical study into roundabout <b>lane</b> <b>entry</b> capacity was thus performed in the U.

A negative exponential relationship with circulating flow predicted lane capacity better at high and low circulating flows, and better reflected the overall trends in the aggregated capacity data, compared to a linear model. The regression models performed relatively well and provided better information on the impacts of the variables than the neural network. The models consistently suggest that entry-exit separation and flows exiting on the same arm have stronger significant effects on capacity than variables such as entry angle and entry radius. These findings could thus contribute to an improved understanding of the variables that affect <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> capacity and therefore the development of better roundabout capacity models...|$|R

An extensive traffic data collection {{formed the basis for}} the calibration of gap acceptance parameters for capacity models.

A maximum likelihood approach {{based on the assumption that}} the critical headway distribution is log-normal gave the best results. Follow-up headways were measured; the median values of this headway was selected as a better measure than the mean. The minimum and maximum values of the (mean) critical headway were estimated both for single-lane roundabouts (see Table 1), and for double-lane roundabouts (see Table 2), as well as for turbo roundabouts (see Table 3); the same tables show the values of the follow-up headway. It should be noted that for double-lane roundabouts the mean values of critical and follow-up headways were differentiated by each <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> (i.e. for the left- and right-lane at entries, where data were available) and distinguished for the inner- and outer circulating lanes. Moreover, a further distinction was made between the major road and the minor road at turbo-roundabouts to consider two antagonist traffic streams for the left <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> of minor roads, and only an antagonist traffic stream for the left- and the right-lane of major roads and for the right <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> of minor roads.

30|$|Various {{researches}} {{and studies}} {{were developed in}} Australia focusing on geometric design, capacity and delays at roundabouts (see e.g. [25, 56 – 58]). Troutbeck [59] addressed the problem about suitability of the gap acceptance theory to adequately predict the capacity of a roundabout and developed an analytical equation based on gap acceptance characteristics which were measured at roundabouts operating below capacity. Critical and follow-up headways were related to roundabout geometry and capacity. Based on Troutbeck’s studies for the Australian Road Research Board, some changes to the analysis and design of roundabouts were proposed [56, 60].

Comparison with neural network analyses on the same dataset showed that the regression models performed relatively well and provided better information on the impacts of the variables. The new empirical models also performed better than existing international capacity models, and provide evidence that entry-exit separation and exiting flows on the same arm have significant effects which were potentially more than those of other commonly used variables such as entry angle and entry radius.

30|$|In a Danish study {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} entry capacity and delay, a double-lane roundabout in Copenhagen, Denmark, was investigated; {{data were collected}} to enables the estimation of critical and follow-up headways [42]. Mean values of critical headways were estimated by using the maximum likelihood methodology [19] for the left- and the right-lane at entries (see Table 2). Critical headway estimates were provided for different levels of circulating flows (low, medium and high) and for the overall circulating flow. Moreover, {{in the case of}} the overall circulating flow, the mean critical headways for the left-lane at entries resulted higher than the mean critical headways for the right-lane. Estimations of the critical headways were performed also when the headway distributions in each circulating lane were considered separately. Thus critical headways were also distinguished for the inner- and outer circulating lane; for each <b>entry</b> <b>lane,</b> the values of critical headways for the inner circulating lane resulted lower than the corresponding values for the outer circulating lane, whereas the standard deviation showed the opposite trend. However, in all cases Hagring [42] observed that the values of critical headways resulted stable, from a minimum value of 3.68  s to a maximum of 4.68  s, with a spread of slightly over a second for the various lanes and circulating flow combinations. Follow-up headways were also estimated both considering different types of vehicles (cars and heavy vehicles), and considering all vehicles. Table 2 shows the all vehicles-related values of follow-up headways. It should be noted that follow-up headways did not vary appreciably by <b>entry</b> <b>lane,</b> but there was a noticeable difference between cars and heavy vehicles; however, the sample size for heavy vehicles resulted small, and did not lead itself to statistical testing.

40|$|AbstractTurbo-roundabouts {{represent}} an innovative scheme of modern roundabouts {{which provides a}} spiraling traffic flow and requires drivers to choose their direction before entering the intersection, since raised lane separators mark the lanes on the ring. The configuration of the turbo-roundabout makes that patterns of conflict at entries with one and two conflicting traffic streams can coexist. This paper presents research efforts aimed at measuring quantitatively the effect of heavy vehicles on operational conditions of a turbo-roundabout. The study starts from the initial belief that the greatest constraints to the vehicular trajectories imposed by the turbo-roundabout necessarily imply {{that the impact of}} heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow is more unfavorable than on other modern roundabouts. Microsimulation revealed as a useful tool when the variation of the traffic quality in turbo-roundabouts should be evaluated in presence of mixed fleets, each having different percentages of heavy vehicles; indeed, it allowed to isolate traffic conditions difficult to observe on field and replicate them to have a number of data as much as possible numerous. Entry capacity values for each <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> of the turbo-roundabout were obtained by microsimulation, varying the percentage of heavy vehicles for entering flows. Nonlinear regression analysis of simulation data allowed to derive the behavioral parameters for heterogeneous populations of users and, ultimately, composed exclusively of heavy vehicles. The capacity functions thus obtained allowed us to determine how the passenger car equivalent (PCE) varies with the percentage of heavy vehicles and circulating flows for each <b>entry</b> <b>lane</b> of the turbo-roundabout. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there is a need to distinguish the impact of heavy vehicles when analyzing the capacity of a turbo-roundabout. When the traffic stream contains a significant number of heavy vehicles, a larger PCE effect would be expected. This effect should be accounted for in the estimation of the turbo-roundabout capacity. Lastly it should be emphasized that an important aspect of the research consists in having identified a methodology for assessing the impact of heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow, that can be applied to different patterns of intersection...|$|R
