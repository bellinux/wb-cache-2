500|$|Despite {{their history}} in the competition, Liverpool manager Roy Evans, felt this would not count for {{anything}} in the final: [...] "Our players haven't really got that much Wembley experience, certainly {{not in terms of}} finals. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for us to have Ian Rush and John Barnes out there." [...] Striker Rush had picked up a hamstring injury while playing for the Welsh national team against Bulgaria, but was expected to be fit. Midfielder Mark Kennedy would not feature in the final as he was ineligible.|$|E

French midfielders Emmanuel Petit and Gilles Grimandi joined from Monaco, where they were protégées to Wenger. Marc Overmars, a midfielder from Ajax, was {{recruited}} in a £7million deal and spoke of his delight at joining Arsenal in his press conference: [...] "I like English football because there is more space. With my speed and quality I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for me here." [...] Deals for midfielders Luís Boa Morte and Alberto Méndez striker Christopher Wreh and goalkeeper Alex Manninger were also finalised before August.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. The American Mathematical Society's Deborah Loewenberg Ball and Hyman Bass {{reviewed}} {{the book from}} a mathematical perspective. Although they praised its [...] "attractive and imaginative fantasy," [...] the two mathematicians found several issues. Ball and Bass were concerned with The Number Devil negative characterization of math teachers, its apparent presentation of mathematics as magical rather than factual, {{and a number of}} other contentions. Ted Dewan, writing for the Times Educational Supplement, believed it to be [...] "far more compelling than a standard text," [...] but found it less adventurous than he hoped for. He also criticized its use in mathematics education, stating [...] "I suspect this is the sort of book that well-meaning adults will mistakenly thrust upon children because <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Overmars {{signed for}} Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was {{reported}} to be between £5million and £7million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week. Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.|$|E

Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role. The Production notes stated; [...] "The role required {{a young woman who}} could be believable as the ruler of that planet, {{but at the same time}} be vulnerable and open". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in [...] (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996), which impressed Lucas. He stated, [...] "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [...] Natalie embodied all those traits and more". Portman was unfamiliar with Star Wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader." ...|$|E

2500|$|Portman was {{a unique}} choice because she was {{unfamiliar}} with Star Wars. [...] "My cousins had always been obsessed with the films, yet I hadn't even seen them before I got the part," [...] she says. [...] "When it all happened for me, my cousins were exclaiming, 'Oh, my God, you're in Star Wars!'" [...] She told a CNN interviewer, [...] "I really wasn't aware of how big a deal Star Wars was ... and when I saw the films, I really liked them, but I still didn't really understand how many ... were passionate fans of this film."

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it {{does not need to be}} fumigated any more [...]|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good,</b> at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
