5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a <b>fire</b> <b>bucket,</b> she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E

60|$|Barbara {{is leaning}} over the parapet, looking towards the town. On her right is the cannon; on her left {{the end of a}} shed raised on piles, with a ladder of three or four steps up to the door, which opens {{outwards}} and has a little wooden landing at the threshold, with a <b>fire</b> <b>bucket</b> {{in the corner of the}} landing. The parapet stops short of the shed, leaving a gap which is the beginning of the path down the hill through the foundry to the town. Behind the cannon is a trolley carrying a huge conical bombshell, with a red band painted on it. Further from the parapet, on the same side, is a deck chair, near the door of an office, which, like the sheds, is of the lightest possible construction.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, <b>fire</b> <b>buckets</b> {{are painted}} bright red {{and have the}} word fire stencilled on them. Often they have a convex, {{protruding}} bottom. The rounded bottom results in a strong, directed stream of water when the water is thrown at the <b>fire.</b> The rounded-bottom <b>bucket</b> is far more efficient in launching the water at the fire than a flat bottom <b>bucket.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>buckets</b> are a low-technology method of fighting small fires. Although largely superseded by more modern forms of firefighting equipment, they retain some distinct advantages and remain the preferred method for fighting small fires in certain situations. The main advantages of <b>fire</b> <b>buckets</b> are that they are cheap, reliable, {{easy to use and}} can be quickly refilled and reinstated.|$|R

60|$|On the {{starboard}} side, but {{close to the}} middle, is a plain oak drawing-table with drawing-board, T-square, straightedges, set squares, mathematical instruments, saucers of water color, a tumbler of discolored water, Indian ink, pencils, and brushes on it. The drawing-board is set so that the draughtsman's chair has the window on its left hand. On the floor {{at the end of}} the table, on its right, is a ship's <b>fire</b> <b>bucket.</b> On the port side of the room, near the bookshelves, is a sofa with its back to the windows. It is a sturdy mahogany article, oddly upholstered in sailcloth, including the bolster, with a couple of blankets hanging over the back. Between the sofa and the drawing-table is a big wicker chair, with broad arms and a low sloping back, with its back to the light. A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase. It is the only article in the room that suggests (not at all convincingly) a woman's hand in the furnishing. The uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the fire}} company's first {{requirements}} was that each member purchase a <b>fire</b> <b>bucket</b> to be kept ready for emergencies at all times. The buckets had rounded bottoms {{so that they could}} not be set down and instead had to be hung; it was thought that buckets with flat bottoms would be used for a variety of purposes and would not be available when and alarm sounded. The buckets were actually used at several fires by forming two lines of firemen between the waters source and the fire. One line of men passed buckets of water to the fire while the other passed back the empty buckets for more water.|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} Szpilman {{explored}} the hospital thoroughly. It {{was full of}} items the Germans intended to take with them, meaning {{he would have to}} be careful travelling around the building in case a group should arrive to loot. To avoid the patrols that occasionally swept the building, Szpilman hid in a lumber room, tucked in a remote corner of the hospital. Food and drink were scarce in the hospital, and for the first four or five days of his stay in the building, Szpilman was unable to find anything. When, again, he went searching for food and drink, Szpilman managed to find some crusts of bread and a <b>fire</b> <b>bucket</b> full of water. The stinking water was covered in an iridescent film, but Szpilman drank deeply, although he stopped after inadvertently swallowing a considerable amount of dead insects.|$|E

50|$|It is {{not known}} whether Ames was {{formally}} trained or not, but his work had a popular appeal. In addition to portraits and landscapes, Ames' surviving accounts books indicated he painted miniatures, carriages, <b>fire</b> <b>buckets,</b> fences, mirror frames, and furniture.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{hardcore}} {{rock and}} roll fan, Paul Barrett was both surprised and amused at John Lennon's appearance at a {{rock and roll}} revival show in Toronto in September 1969 and promptly {{wrote a letter to}} the music press inviting Lennon to audition for the Sunsets. [...] The offer may have escaped the Beatle's attention, but it was enough for the Rolling Stones management to offer the group a support slot at their forthcoming show at the Saville Theatre in London on 14 December. The resultant gig suggested that Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets were not quite ready for the big time. A nervous Shaky was disconcerted at having to use Mick Jagger's PA system and, when realising he had left his drumsticks back in Cardiff, Louie had to borrow a pair from Charlie Watts. On discovering his snare stand was also missing, he resorted to resting the drum on an upturned <b>fire</b> <b>bucket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Marillion {{heard the}} tape and were {{interested}} enough {{to ask for a}} meeting with the singer. Later accounts of this first meeting record that Hogarth turned up at band member Pete Trewavas' house with his demo tapes contained in a red plastic <b>fire</b> <b>bucket</b> - the audition taking place in Trewavas' garage, due to the presence of cats in the house (see below). The band were immediately impressed by his vocal prowess. Hogarth himself, however, took a little longer to make up his mind, holding as he did at the time a potentially lucrative offer to tour the U.S. on keyboards with The The. As he later recalled in a 2001 interview by Classic Rock, he had a choice [...] "between the most hip band in the world, and the least...". In the end he accepted the position with Marillion, won over as the band wanted an equal partner and were offering a potentially permanent arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|In the town, Daffy {{is about}} to take a drink at the bar when Nasty Canasta walks in past his 'Wanted' poster (which states [...] "$5,000,000 REWARD (DEAD)" [...] and [...] "RUSTLER, BANDIT, SQUARE DANCE CALLER"). Daffy tries to intimidate Canasta with his gun ("Stick 'em up, hombre! You're under arrest"), but Canasta just bites off most of the gun and eats it ("Hmm. Probably didn't have his iron today!"). Canasta then threateningly orders Daffy [...] "two of his usual", a drink made of various poisons and toxic {{materials}} like cobra fang juice, hydrogen bitters and old panther (so hot that when two ice cubes are put in it, the ice cubes jump out, yelping and bouncing into a <b>fire</b> <b>bucket</b> to cool off). Canasta downs the drink with no side effects (other than his hat flipping), and when Daffy gets Porky to take the second drink with seemingly no side-effects, Daffy downs a third as well. A few seconds later, Daffy and Porky exhibit wild side effects, including reciting [...] "Mary had a Little Lamb" [...] in Elmer Fudd-ese, turning green, and acting like they're both motorized and Daffy's bullets shooting a hole in the floor which he falls into, then rockets out of before coming back to earth. Daffy sternly says to Canasta [...] "I hate you." [...] Eventually, Daffy challenges Canasta to a showdown in the street.|$|E
50|$|The city hosts four museums. The Fire Museum {{is housed}} in a {{restored}} 1901 firehouse building. The museum's firefighting equipment and memorabilia include leather <b>fire</b> <b>buckets</b> used in colonial times, a display showing the evolution of sprinkler systems, a horse-drawn hose wagon, a 1921 Ahrens-Fox fire pumper, and a 105 ft 1911 water tower.|$|R
50|$|The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department got {{its start}} in February 1848 when {{residents}} were ordered to have <b>fire</b> <b>buckets</b> ready in their homes. It wasn't until three years later, after several major fires, that the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that authorized the formation of Atlanta Fire Company No. 1, which went into service on March 25, 1851.|$|R
50|$|Over 200 {{years of}} {{firefighting}} history {{is on display}} in the Fire Museum of Greater Cincinnati. Exhibits include examples of early leather <b>fire</b> <b>buckets,</b> an 1808 <b>fire</b> drum, the oldest surviving fire engine in Cincinnati, and an 1836 hand pumper. The museum also features and interactive exhibit that allows visitors to experience a modern Emergency-One fire engine cab by wailing the siren, ringing the bell, and flashing the lights.|$|R
5000|$|Antique {{folk art}} is {{distinguished}} from traditional art in that, while collected today based mostly on its artistic merit, {{it was never}} intended to be 'art for art’s sake' {{at the time of}} its creation. Examples include: weathervanes, old store signs and carved figures, itinerant portraits, carousel horses, <b>fire</b> <b>buckets,</b> painted game boards, cast iron doorstops and many other similar lines of highly collectible [...] "whimsical" [...] antiques.|$|R

50|$|The jury {{also found}} crewmens {{mistakes}} and violation of safety regulations {{to be at}} fault. Hilliard testified that once crew members noticed the fire, they went below deck to check the engines before attempting to fight the blaze. The jury believed that the fire could have been extinguished if the crew had acted immediately. Also, {{not all of the}} ships <b>fire</b> <b>buckets</b> could be found during the fire. Only about 20 of the passengers were able to locate life preservers. The crew members were also careless in launching the lifeboats, all of which sank.|$|R
2500|$|The safety {{deficiencies}} included inadequate fog horns; {{rather a}} steam driven horn, the vessels were using hand-held tin horns {{driven by a}} hand-bellows, or a weak manual horn simply blown by mouth, insufficient fire axes and <b>fire</b> <b>buckets,</b> not enough oars in the lifeboats, no plugs in the lifeboat drains, lack of life preserver notices and instructions, no load capacity marked on lifeboats, and boat falls and davits in poor condition. [...] Inspectors strictly counted the total numbers of persons boarded on each vessel, and gave notice {{that there would be}} no more remissions of fines for equipment defects. [...] (It had been the custom that heavy fines imposed on steamboats would be remitted upon a showing of compliance by the vessel's owners.) ...|$|R
