5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge,</b> springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E
25|$|There are no <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> {{assessments}} for Uganda, {{which is}} why the country's groundwater potential is unknown. Regional assessments in Ugandan towns, however, have indicated that <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> meets the current abstraction volumes. To monitor {{the quantity and quality of}} groundwater and surface water, the National Water Resources network has been established under the responsibility of the Water Resources Management Department.|$|E
50|$|Protecting Gotjawal forest {{contributes}} to protecting groundwater in two ways: (1) Gotjawal forest {{is an important}} <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging</b> area. So, by protecting the forest, the <b>groundwater</b> can be <b>recharged.</b> (2) Golf courses use huge amounts of groundwater.|$|R
50|$|Also, Gotjawal lava {{which is}} formed by {{volcanic}} activities has high transmissibility and thus takes {{the role of}} the Jeju <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharger.</b> The <b>groundwater</b> of Dongbaekdongsan wetland is used as one of the sources of groundwater that supports many in the Jeju Island.|$|R
25|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{are using}} {{and others are}} investigating Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) of reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water may be pumped into (subsurface recharge) or percolated down to (surface <b>recharge)</b> <b>groundwater</b> aquifers, pumped out, treated again, and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also {{be referred to as}} <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging.</b> This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth/sand (absorption) and microflora in the soil (biodegradation).|$|R
25|$|The Sea of Galilee and the Coastal Aquifer are Israel's main {{water storage}} facilities, with a {{combined}} storage capacity of about 2 billion cubic meters. The coastal aquifer is used for artificial <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} Orange County {{which is located}} in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in {{indirect}} potable reuse. A large-scale artificial <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.|$|E
25|$|Artificial <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> {{is practiced}} {{extensively}} in Israel from flood water, potable {{water from the}} National Water Carrier and treated wastewater. Artificial recharge has increased groundwater levels in the Coastal Aquifer and counteracted further seawater intrusion. <b>Groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> from flood water is done by collecting runoff from winter rains in a drainage basin and directing it into recharge ponds. The groundwater is then pumped back up during summer through wells around the recharge ponds. The cost of the recharge process is limited to maintenance, with pumping costs amounting to only $0.02–0.03 per cubic meter. About 40–50% more water than the average recharge is pumped from the aquifer {{in order to create}} a temporary hydrological depression that creates space for artificial recharge the following winter.|$|E
30|$|The West Bokaro {{coalfield}} is a richest coal-mining belt in the Damodar Valley, India. The extensive mining of {{the area}} has resulted in disruption of the groundwater availability {{in terms of both}} quantity and quality. This has led to a drinking water crisis, especially during the pre-monsoon period in the West Bokaro coalfield area. The characterization of the hydrogeological system and the artificial recharging of the aquifers might help to better manage the problem of the groundwater-level depletion. For this purpose, seven important hydrogeological factors (water depth, slope, drainage, soil, infiltration, lithology, and landuse) have been considered to define the most suitable locations for artificial <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging</b> in the mining area. Different thematic maps were prepared from existing maps and data sets, remote-sensing images, and field investigations for identification of the most suitable locations for artificial recharge. Thematic layers for these parameters were prepared, classified, weighted, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) environment by means of fuzzy logic. The results of the study indicate that about 29 and 31 % {{of the area}} are very suitable and suitable for recharging purposes in the West Bokaro coalfield. However, the rest of the area is moderate to unsuitable for recharging due to the ongoing mining and related activities in the study area. The <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging</b> map of the study area was validated with measured electrical conductivity (EC) values in the groundwater, and it indicated that validation can be accepted for the identification of <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging</b> sites. These findings are providing useful information for the proper planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the study area.|$|R
40|$|From March to September 1995, the Isotope Sciences Division of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{performed}} isotopic {{measurements on}} {{water in the}} Orange County Forebay region. The goal was to test the applicability of isotope techniques for determining the current groundwater flow paths and flow rates in the OCWD spreading facilities. Successful results could then be used to predict the fate of proposed reclaimed waste water recharge. Stable isotope measurements in surface waters and groundwaters in the Forebay region of the Orange County groundwater basin provided a general source indicator. The data defined three general groups: (1) <b>groundwater</b> derived from <b>recharged</b> Santa Ana River water (SAR),(2) groundwater resulting from a mixture of recharged Colorado River water and the SAR, and (3) <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharged</b> from the Santiago basin area. In {{the first group of}} data, recharge directly from the SAR flow was not readily distinguishable from <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharged</b> via the spreading ponds. Some groundwater samples from Forebay wells showed significant temporal variability in stable isotope values, while others remained constant throughout the study period. The temporal changes in the groundwater stable isotope signatures are believed to be controlled by similar variations in the stable isotope signatures of the surface water recharge. With further sampling, these seasonal isotopic variations may provide a viable tracer for young (< 2 years) groundwater...|$|R

The San Gorgonio River which rises further west {{on the south}} side of San Gorgonio Mountain then joins it. Garnet Wash, Mission Creek, Chino Canyon Wash, Palm Canyon Wash, Cathedral Canyon and Thousand Palm Canyon Wash also join, but the water mainly penetrates through the porous desert floor, providing <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging</b> of the Coachella Valley aquifer.|$|R
25|$|The river {{provides}} <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> and a {{water supply}} for agriculture. The river's floodplain includes many vineyards, and {{an area of}} the Russian River Valley was approved as an American Viticultural Area in 1983 and enlarged in 2006. It produces award-winning Chardonnay and Pinot noir wines in addition to other wine varietals, and is home to many small and several large commercial wineries.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is a {{groundwater}} {{storage reservoir}} {{in the water}} cycle. While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The USGS has performed several studies of the aquifer, {{to determine what is}} coming in (<b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and baseflow to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).|$|E
25|$|The {{water in}} a river is usually in a channel, {{made up of a}} stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is also a wider {{floodplain}} shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation {{to the size of the}} river channel. Rivers are a part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge,</b> springs, and the release of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{a part of the}} {{preliminary}} results of three years investigation activity, carried in Dar es Salaam coastal plain (Tanzania), ACC-DAR project, supported by the European Union, in cooperation with Sapienza University of Rome and Ardhi University of Dar es Salaam. Here, they are presented the effects of rainfall data evolution in the last 50 years on the <b>groundwater</b> active <b>recharge,</b> due to land cover evolution. As a matter of fact, in the last fifteen years the Dar es Salaam coastal plan has been involved in a hard increasing of groundwater exploitation, due to increased population. On the on the hand, the <b>groundwater</b> active <b>recharge</b> has been decreased, due to the evolution of land cover. In the framework of the project, the rainfall data have been collected referred to 50 years of observations in the three urban stations of Dar es Salaam. Starting from the data collection of the continuous historical rainfall series, it has been evaluated the <b>groundwater</b> active <b>recharge</b> for different land cover scenarios from remote sensing data. The results have been compared to water demand evolution values, referred to the same temporal range, and it has been outlined that {{in the last few years}} the water demand, in this area, has overpassed the <b>groundwater</b> active <b>recharge...</b>|$|R
25|$|Floods {{magnitude}} and frequency {{is likely to}} increase due to intense precipitation and land use change, especially around urban areas. <b>Groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> will also be affected by change on precipitation, although it is not expected to be substantially lower. However, MVOTMA expects an increase in groundwater use in the future due to an increased water demand for irrigation and industrial purposes. Higher demand could increase pressure in already stressed systems such as the Raigon Aquifer and Southern areas where {{there is a need for}} groundwater integrated management systems.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{is heavily}} relied upon for water supply {{as a result}} of {{polluted}} surface water, and sufficient supplies of fresh groundwater are available throughout most of the country. <b>Groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> from infiltration is estimated at 6.15km3 per year whereby 5.97km3 is considered base flow that serves to recharge surface waters and therefore has the possibility of being extracted. The remaining unused water passes down through the river system and discharges into the Pacific Ocean. The best aquifers are located in coastal areas and valleys of the central plateau where substantial groundwater aquifers are located at depths of 10–100 meters.|$|E
25|$|Impervious {{surfaces}} (roads, {{parking lots}} and sidewalks) are constructed during land development. During rain storms and other precipitation events, these surfaces (built from materials such as asphalt and concrete), along with rooftops, carry polluted stormwater to storm drains, instead of allowing the water to percolate through soil. This causes lowering of the water table (because <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> is lessened) and flooding since {{the amount of water}} that remains on the surface is greater. Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers and bays. This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.|$|E
30|$|The {{results show}} that about 60 % of the area was {{suitable}} for recharging purposes, while 40 % of the area was moderate to unsuitable for <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharging.</b> This study highlights that the mining and related activities have an adverse effect on the groundwater potential in the study area. Thus, this study provided the most suitable artificial recharging sites in the study area, {{for the purpose of}} improving the groundwater level. This may be helpful in the future for the sustainable management of the water resources in these mining areas.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{water and}} {{groundwater}} {{are the main}} water resources used for drinking and production. Assessments {{of the relationship between}} surface water and groundwater provide information for water resource management in Sanjiang plain, Northeast China. The surface water (river, lake, and wetland) and groundwater were sampled and analyzed for stable isotopic (delta D, delta O- 18) composition, tritium, and chlorofluorocarbons concentrations. The local meteoric water line is delta D = 7. 3 delta O- 18 - 6. 7. The tritium (T) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) contents in groundwater were analyzed to determine the groundwater ages. Most groundwater were modern water with the ages < 50 years. The groundwaters in mountain area and near rivers were younger than in the central plain. The oxygen isotope (delta O- 18) was used to quantify the relationship between surface water and groundwater. The Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli rivers were gaining rivers, but the shallow <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharged</b> from rivers at the confluence area of rivers. At the confluence of Songhua and Heilongjiang rivers, 88 % of the shallow <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharged</b> from Songhua river.

This plant was de-commissioned in 2004 and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity (265,000 m3 per day with an ultimate capacity of 492,000 m3 per day), {{under the name of}} Groundwater Replenishment System.|$|E

The new integrated sewage and storm-water system intercepts 38 former sewage and industrial effluent discharge points and route it to sewage treatment plants south of Vasna Barrage. Thus it reduced the water pollution in the river. The water level in the river is retained through Vasna Barrage and the losing water is replenished by the Narmada Canal. It enabled the <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> and the recreational facilities like boating in the river. There are also plans to replenish river by treated sewage water.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater: The water {{emerging}} from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to {{a high degree of}} clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high bacteriological quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or manganese content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharge</b> is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn inter-laboratory {{comparison}} exercise {{involving the}} environmental tracers used for groundwater dating was organized in 2012 in France. This paper focuses on SF 6 and CFC tracers. Sampling and analytical protocols were compared {{in three different}} exercises using: (1) groundwater from a homogeneous aquifer, (2) groundwater from a fractured heterogeneous aquifer and (3) an air standard. The results show good agreement between laboratories (except some outliers) for the aquifers and air standard. Variation in the SF 6 results on the air standard was low (RSD = 2 %) compared to CFCs (RSD 3 – 7 %), even though its concentration was two orders of magnitude lower. Results obtained on recent <b>groundwater</b> (<b>recharged</b> post 1980) show that the inter-laboratory uncertainty for groundwater dating with SF 6 is 3 – 4 years. This large uncertainty is mainly due to sampling and/or analytical problems. For CFCs, the uncertainties obtained from all laboratories were less than 2 years for <b>groundwater</b> <b>recharged</b> between 1965 and 1996. A higher RSD was observed for CFCs with the air standard analysis, as compared to groundwater measurement, which could indicate an additional uncertainty due to inadequate standardization. Different sampling protocols were used by the laboratories (glass bottles, steel cylinders, etc.) but no systematic effect on measurement uncertainty {{could be attributed to}} any of these protocols for either CFCs or SF 6. The better precisions obtained through these exercises indicate that, except for CFC- 11 and SF 6, the corresponding uncertainty in recharge date determination on recent groundwater (1993 – present) is higher than the commonly assumed 1 – 2 years (i. e., 7 years for CFC- 12 and 4 years for CFC- 113). These results confirm the need for regular inter-laboratory comparison exercises to improve the analytical and sampling procedures used in groundwater dating...|$|R
