40|$|International audienceWe {{intend to}} build a global {{environmental}} impact indicator of air pollution to assess transport infrastructures and technologies. This indicator should be simple and transparent to facilitate its use in decision-making. The intention is for the indicator to resemble the Global Warming Potential (GWP), which establishes {{a relationship between the}} emission of six greenhouse gases and the average temperature increase of the <b>Earth.</b> The <b>indicator</b> will therefore permit estimating the global environmental impact of transport-generated air pollution, while simultaneously conserving the value of the environmental impact of each type of air pollution and the emission assessment. This work is based on an impact typology, a set of indicators, and an aggregation architecture of atmospheric pollution. The typology is established as a combination of the specific and homogenous characteristics of each type of pollution in terms of pollutant, impact mechanism, target and environmental impact. To ensure exhaustiveness and non-redundancy, 10 types of air pollution impact are proposed: greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, direct ecotoxicity (this type of pollution excludes greenhouse effects on nature, ozone depletion, eutrophication, acidification and photochemical pollution), eutrophication, acidification, photochemical pollution, restricted direct health effects (not taking into account welfare, and excluding the effects on health of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, acidification and photochemical pollution), sensitive pollution (annoyance caused by odours and fumes), and degradation of common and historical man-made heritage. Indicators similar to GWP can be identified in the literature for each type of atmospheric pollution, except for the degradation of common and historical man-made heritage, for which the financial cost of conservation could be used. However, these indicators do not seem to have achieved wide scientific consensus, except for GWP, which may make it necessary to continue research in this field. Aggregating the different indicators is proposed by using an architecture composed of two structures that aggregate types of air pollution.

The potential for using them as the primary transducer for monitoring high frequency currents {{as well as the}} power system frequency components provides the basis for extensive research into the use of transient based protection using current signals. This investigation has examined the response of a representative sample of 50 Hz distribution system {{current transformers}} to signals in the range of 1 kHz to 100 kHz. This will provide an insight into whether or not they can be used reliably to detect signals within this frequency band. The performances of a variety of current transformers of different types are examined. These included standard distribution system CTs, class X CTs and <b>earth</b> fault passage <b>indicator</b> CTs. The ages of these CTs varied from new units to those that had been withdrawn after thirty or more years in service. The results have shown that the distribution system current transformers have a good accuracy in the range of frequencies from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. It is therefore concluded that such current transformers can be used as an appropriate interface for transient based protection using current signals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlobal {{trade of}} biomass-related {{products}} is growing exponentially, resulting in increasing ‘teleconnections’ between producing and consuming regions. Sustainable {{management of the}} <b>earth's</b> lands requires <b>indicators</b> to monitor these connections across regions and scales. The ‘embodied human appropriation of NPP’ (eHANPP) allows one to consistently attribute the HANPP resulting from production chains to consumers. HANPP {{is the sum of}} land-use induced NPP changes and biomass harvest. We present the first national-level assessment of embodied HANPP related to agriculture based on a calculation using bilateral trade matrices. The dataset allows (1) the tracing of the biomass-based products consumed in Austria in the year 2000 to their countries of origin and quantifying the HANPP caused in production, and (2) the assigning of the national-level HANPP on Austria's territory to the consumers of the products on the national level. The dataset is constructed along a consistent system boundary between society and ecosystems and can be used to assess Austria's physical trade balance in terms of eHANPP. Austria's eHANPP-trade balance is slightly negative (imports are larger than exports); import and export flows are large in relation to national HANPP. Our findings show how the eHANPP approach can be used for quantifying and mapping the teleconnections related to a nation's biomass metabolism...|$|R

Their amount and distribution, and the temperature in the core, are essential for understanding how the core and the mantle interact and for modelling the geodynamo which generates the planetary magnetic field. However, there is a longstanding controversy surrounding the identity and quantity of the light elements. Here, the theory of tricritical phenomena is employed as a precise theoretical framework to study solidification at the high pressures and temperatures where both experimental and numerical methods are complicated to implement and have large uncertainties in their results. Combining the theory with the most reliable iron melting data and the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) seismic data, one obtains the solidification temperature at the inner core boundary (ICB) for both pure iron and for the alloy of iron and light {{elements in}} the actual core melt. One also finds a value of about 2. 5 mole% for the amount of light matter. In addition, the density of both solid and liquid pure iron at its melting temperature is found. This allows one to obtain the density of the light matter and thus to identify it to be MgSiO 3. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{addresses}} {{the role of}} satellite <b>Earth</b> Observation (EO) <b>indicators</b> within an operational crop yield forecasting system for the European Union (EU) and neighbouring countries, by exploring the correlation between official yield statistics and indicators derived from fAPAR time-series at sub-national level for the period 1999 – 2012, and by identifying possible differences across agro-climatic conditions in Europe. A significant correlation between fAPAR and official yields (R 2 > 0. 6) was found in water-limited yield agro-climatic conditions (e. g. the Black Sea region and the Mediterranean basin) for all three crops studied. In regions where crops experience frequent water stress, most of the yield inter-annual variability is explained by substantial changes in leaf area {{from one year to}} another, and can be well captured by regional fAPAR time-series. By contrast, in regions characterized by high yields (e. g. northern Europe) – where water constraints are generally not frequent and, therefore, fAPAR inter-annual variability is low – the correlation between fAPAR and yield is weaker (R 2 < 0. 5) as yield variations tend to be explained by multiple factors other than green leaf area. These results confirm the reliability of EO time-series for operational crop yield forecasting at regional level, but also suggest that additional meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration) need {{to be taken into account}} to interpret EO products meaningfully. Moreover, specific issues related to the spatial resolution of the EO-products, and the absence of dynamic crop masks, currently impede access to crop-specific time-series in the fragmented agricultural landscapes of Europe, and restrict the use of 1 -km biophysical products to major crops...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLife cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{is based}} on the basic principles of sustainable development. LCA method demonstrated its efficiency in providing a systematic environmental assessment approach of a product or a process. The effectiveness and efficiency of these methods {{lies in the fact that}} they take into account all life cycle stages of a product, from the extraction of raw materials to end of life treatment (recycling, [...] .) through an assessment covering different impact categories such as climate change, human health, ecosystems and resources. Existing LCA indicators reflect different issues surrounding resource depletion, creating inconsistency and moreover confusion among LCA practitioners. The evaluation of different life cycle impacts assessment (LCIA) methods done by EC JRC showed that available models did not address the same parameters: short- vs long-term, stock vs backup technology, etc. It also showed that if the correlation between the methods was sufficient for some resources, others such as rare earth elements showed a high level of inconsistency between methods. It was therefore necessary to develop a relevant indicator and harmonized assessment of impacts on resources in LCA. Furthermore, a resource strategy indicator based on the three pillars of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social) would better address wider challenges and making it a more powerful decision making tool. This study aimed to introduce an indicator for evaluating the strategy implications of metal resources for products and to compare different ways of production resulting from extraction of raw materials or recycling, with a special focus on rare <b>earth</b> materials. The <b>indicator</b> would assess the impacts based on a reserve-resource vision [BGS NERC] and the evolution over time and founded over three parameters: technical feasibility, economic viability and political stability (including social and environmental aspects) in representing countries...|$|R
