[...] The film makers seem more {{concerned}} with showcasing the toys than providing entertainment; shared profits obviously count for more than shared feelings. If someone started selling 'Hate Bears,' there undoubtedly would be a film about them." [...] Gene Siskel awarded the film zero stars out of four [...] (along with [...] "Thumbs Down" [...] on At the Movies—the Siskel & Ebert TV show having not been introduced yet), while Leonard Maltin gave it a [...] "BOMB" [...] rating in his Movie Guide, and added: [...] "Your kids <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> entertainment than this treacly stuff about the Kingdom of Caring.

500|$|Before {{the first}} of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was {{considering}} to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing. Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying, ...|$|E

That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E

500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine. She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

2500|$|Some have {{described}} unequal treatment {{of humans and}} animals {{as a form of}} speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness. Val Plumwood (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness [...] "anthropocentrism" [...] to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with racism and sexism, Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating [...] "carnism". The animal rights movement seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries. Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of {{what it is to be}} a [...] "person", argues that livestock animals feel enough to <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of the double standard underlying speciesism but also the double standard underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds.|$|E

One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would <b>deserve</b> <b>better</b> still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.|$|E
60|$|Economic {{injustice}} {{is perhaps}} the most obvious evil of our present system.

Some kinds of work require a larger income for efficiency than others do; but there is economic injustice as soon as a man has more than his share, unless it is because his efficiency in his work requires it, or as a reward for some definite service. But this point is so obvious that it needs no elaboration.|$|E

60|$|A {{very common}} mode of aerating bread in America {{is by the}} {{effervescence}} of an acid and an alkali in the flour. The carbonic acid gas thus formed produces minute air-cells in the bread, or, as the cook says, makes it light. When this process is performed with exact attention to chemical laws, so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize each other, leaving no overplus of either, the result is often very palatable. The difficulty is, {{that this is a}} happy conjunction of circumstances which seldom occurs. The acid most commonly employed is that of sour milk, and, as milk has many degrees of sourness, the rule of a certain quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily produce very different results at different times. As an actual fact, where this mode of making bread prevails, as we lament to say it does to a great extent in this country, one finds five cases of failure to one of success. It is a woful thing that the daughters of New England have abandoned the old respectable mode of yeast brewing and bread raising for this specious substitute, so easily made, and so seldom well made. The green, clammy, acrid substance called biscuit, which many of our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in these days, is wholly unworthy {{of the men and women}} of the Republic.
