40|$|The causal logic behind many {{arguments}} in historical institutionalism emphasizes the enduring impact of choices made during critical <b>junctures</b> in history. These choices close off alternative options {{and lead to}} the establishment of institutions that generate self-reinforcing path-dependent processes. Despite the theoretical and practical importance of critical <b>junctures,</b> however, analyses of path dependence often devote little attention to them. The article reconstructs the concept of critical <b>junctures,</b> delimits its range of application, and provides methodological guidance for its use in historical institutional analyses.

The framework constitutes a rigorous approach to the identification of crisis, ideational change, and policy change. It is used to examine the economic disasters in Brazil in 1999 and Argentina in 2001.

The 2nd Brigade, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, was so called as it consisted of an English, the 1st (The Royals); a Scottish, 2nd ('Scots Greys'); and an Irish, 6th (Inniskilling); regiment of heavy dragoons.|$|E

Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target.

50|$|Collier's most {{sweeping}} work on Latin America, {{the fruit}} of over a decade of research, is Shaping the Political Arena: Critical <b>Junctures,</b> the Labor Movement, and Regime Dynamics in Latin America (1991), coauthored with Ruth Berins Collier. This major work makes two fundamental theoretical contributions. The first concerns the linked ideas of (a) critical <b>junctures,</b> periods of crucial change {{in the history of}} given countries or other political units that are hypothesized to leave distinctive legacies, and (b) path dependence, the trajectories of change stemming from and constrained by critical <b>junctures.</b> These were, in one sense, not new ideas. The distinctive contribution of Shaping the Political Arena was to turn these ideas into a carefully formulated model directly relevant to research in comparative politics; and to then offer a magisterial application of this model to Latin American cases. This book was the first, and still remains, one of the most systematic formulations and applications of critical <b>junctures</b> and path dependency. It convincingly dispelled whatever doubts may have existed about the potentially decisive effect historical events and turning points could have on key political outcomes, from political regimes to democracy to party systems. The lasting effect of Collier’s contribution is evident in many ways. Collier inspired other researchers in the field of comparative politics (e.g., Kathleen Thelen, Paul Pierson, Deborah Yashar, and James Mahoney) to fine-tune and further develop the model presented in Shaping the Political Arena. Moreover, the applications that draw on Collier’s core ideas about critical <b>junctures</b> and path dependence go beyond political science to economics.|$|R
