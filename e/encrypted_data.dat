5|$|The {{enterprise}} {{version of}} Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from accessing <b>encrypted</b> <b>data,</b> and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E

50|$|In October 2013, The Washington Post {{reported}} that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Google's data centers, {{as part of a}} program named MUSCULAR. This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not <b>encrypt</b> <b>data</b> passed inside its own network. Google began <b>encrypting</b> <b>data</b> sent between data centers in 2013.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} protect the data being stored or {{transferred}} from being read if intercepted, many archive formats include the capability to <b>encrypt</b> the <b>data.</b> There are multiple mathematical algorithms available to <b>encrypt</b> <b>data.</b>|$|R
25|$|As a {{potential}} counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example {{such as that}} of a drive which has been securely wiped).|$|E
25|$|Another {{situation}} where quick guessing is possible {{is when the}} password is used to form a cryptographic key. In such cases, an attacker can quickly {{check to see if}} a guessed password successfully decodes <b>encrypted</b> <b>data.</b> For example, one commercial product claims to test 103,000 WPA PSK passwords per second.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{modifications}} to the original protocols, like False Start (adopted and enabled by Google Chrome) or Snap Start, reportedly introduced limited TLS protocol downgrade attacks or allowed {{modifications to}} the cipher suite list sent by the client to the server. In doing so, an attacker might succeed in influencing the cipher suite selection {{in an attempt to}} downgrade the cipher suite negotiated to use either a weaker symmetric encryption algorithm or a weaker key exchange. A paper presented at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference on computer and communications security in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the <b>encrypted</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Before 2013, Google did not <b>encrypt</b> <b>data</b> {{stored on}} its servers. Following {{information}} that the United States' National Security Agency had [...] "direct access" [...] to servers owned by multiple technology companies, including Google, the company began testing <b>encrypting</b> <b>data</b> in July, and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in November. However, as of 2015, Google Drive does not provide client-side encryption.|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{have also}} {{explored}} data integrity enforcement based on encryption. Tuck et al. proposed a new hardware to <b>encrypted</b> control <b>data</b> (Tuck et al. 2004). CCFI utilizes the AES-NI instructions on x 86 processors to protect control data in C/C++ applications (Mashtizadeh et al. 2015). Encryption-based techniques require private storage {{to hold the}} encryption keys. Additionally, the <b>encrypt</b> <b>data</b> in memory suffers from replay attacks, where the attacker can replace one piece of <b>encrypt</b> <b>data</b> with another piece to change the decrypted value without knowing the encryption keys.|$|R
25|$|Internet fraud may be by {{claiming}} a chargeback {{which is not}} justified ("friendly fraud"), or {{carried out by the}} use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either online or offline. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> may be cracked.|$|E
25|$|Onion routing is {{implemented}} by encryption {{in the application}} layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single {{point at which the}} communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.|$|E

2500|$|The fighter-interceptor {{version of}} the Viggen, the JA 37, {{featured}} various avionics changes, including the extensive use of digital electronics alongside mechanical technology. In 1985, the [...] "fighter link" [...] went into service, permitting <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> communication between four fighters; this enabled one fighter to [...] "paint" [...] an airborne enemy with guidance radar for the Skyflash missiles of the three other fighters in a group while they had their search and guidance radar switched off. This system was operational ten years before any other country's. [...] The autopilot was also slaved to the radar control to obtain better precision firing the cannon. Once in service, the Viggen's software was regularly updated every 18 months. In 1983, the {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) was reported as 100 hours, a very high reliability level for the generation of avionics systems involved.|$|E
2500|$|Once a user is {{logged on}} successfully, {{access to his}} own EFS <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> {{requires}} no additional authentication, decryption happens transparently. Thus, any compromise of the user's password automatically leads to access to that data. Windows can store versions of user account passphrases with reversible encryption, though {{this is no longer}} default behaviour; it can also be configured to store (and will by default on the original version of Windows XP and lower) Lan Manager hashes of the local user account passphrases, which can be attacked and broken easily. It also stores local user account passphrases as NTLM hashes, which can be fairly easily attacked using [...] "rainbow tables" [...] if the passwords are weak (Windows Vista and later versions don't allow weak passwords by default). To mitigate the threat of trivial brute-force attacks on local passphrases, older versions of Windows need to be configured (using the Security Settings portion of Group Policy) to never store LM hashes, and of course, to not enable Autologon (which stores plaintext passphrases in the registry). Further, using local user account passphrases over 14 characters long prevents Windows from storing an LM hash in the SAM – and has the added benefit of making brute-force attacks against the NTLM hash harder.|$|E
2500|$|According to Chinese {{advertisements}} released during various defense / aerospace / electronic {{exhibitions in}} the past, conversion kits {{have been developed}} for destroyers to deploy multiple UAVs. The developers of both the JRSCCS and the combat data system have claimed that their products could handle the information needed to control UAVs. [...] However, {{it is highly unlikely that}} any long range UAVs will ever be deployed on board this class because the complete handling system to support these large UAVs would need the entire hangar, thus displacing the only helicopter on board. [...] Chinese governmental media, however, did release photos of a variety of propeller driven light UAVs being launched from destroyers and claimed that these light UAVs could be deployed on every [...] destroyer class currently in Chinese service, and some of the pictures have depicted some UAVs carry laser targeting pods, providing guidance for laser guided projectiles. [...] However, as of mid-2007, it still can not be confirmed that if any light UAVs has been on board Type 052C class on a regular basis. [...] The lack of regular deployment of UAVs on board only seems to confirm the claim that the laser guided projectiles for the main gun are not deployed due to the lack of associating guidance equipment. [...] On August 17, 2008, another type of UAV named as Hummingbird carrying electro-optical pod were deployed on board for the successful test of a new data link developed by China Northern Co. (中国北方公司). [...] The new data link is a two-way real-time <b>encrypted</b> <b>data</b> link designed to replace the current HN-900 data link, and it is designated as NCTDL, short for Naval Common Tactical Data Link. [...] The new data link is claimed by many Chinese to be at least equal to the Link 16, and even comparable to Link 22, but such claims have yet to be verified by both the Chinese government and sources outside China. [...] However, it is certain that the new data link will replace HN-900 currently in service on board PLAN ships.|$|E
