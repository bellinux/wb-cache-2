5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
5|$|Authors of the 12th and 13th centuries such as Joseph of Exeter and Albert of Stade {{continued}} {{to tell the}} legend of the Trojan War in Latin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> follows Dares' tale with Troilus remaining {{one of the most important}} warriors on the Trojan side. However, it was two of their contemporaries, Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his French verse romance and Guido delle Colonne in his Latin prose history, both also admirers of Dares, who were to define the tale of Troy for the remainder of the medieval period. The details of their narrative of the war were copied, for example, in the Troy Books of Laud and Lydgate and also Raoul Lefevre's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Lefevre, through Caxton's 1474 printed translation, was in turn to become the best known retelling of the Troy story in Renaissance England and influenced Shakespeare among others. The story of Troilus as a lover, invented by Benoît and retold by Guido, generated a second line of influence. It was taken up as a tale that could be told in its own right by Boccaccio and then by Chaucer who established a tradition of retelling and elaborating the story in English-language literature, which was to be followed by Henryson and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

5|$|Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division {{designed}} the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation {{in order to}} produce the required wave form. Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E

25|$|A {{data subject}} can, subject to proving the data subject’s identity, request a data {{controller}} to confirm if the data controller holds that data subject’s personal data, describe {{the nature of}} the personal data held, and the identity of any third party who has or has previously had access to that data (Section 32(1)). The request must however be made in a reasonable manner, within a reasonable time, after paying any prescribed fees and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> is generally understandable (Section 32(2)).|$|E
25|$|A radio {{altimeter}} measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides {{the distance between}} the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the {{radio altimeter}}. However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> was adaptable for aircraft use.|$|E

25|$|The final orchestral work by Debussy, {{the ballet}} Jeux (1912) written for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, {{contains}} {{some of his}} strangest harmonies and textures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> moves freely over its own field of motivic connection. At first, Jeux was overshadowed by Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which was composed {{in the same year}} as Jeux, and was premiered only two weeks later by the same ballet company. Decades later, composers such as Pierre Boulez and Jean Barraqué pointed out parallels to Anton Webern's serialism in this work.|$|E
25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E
25|$|Algorithms can be {{expressed}} in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> can be executed by a computer, but are often used {{as a way to}} define or document algorithms.|$|E

25|$|Hemozoin {{crystals}} have {{a distinct}} triclinic structure and are weakly magnetic. The difference between diamagnetic low-spin oxyhemoglobin and paramagnetic hemozoin {{can be used}} for isolation. They also exhibit optical dichroism, which means that they absorb light more strongly along their length than across their width, which allows the automated detection of malaria. Hemozoin is produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that,</b> under the action of an applied magnetic field, gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration; and precise measurement of this induced dichroism may be used to determine the level of malarial infection.|$|E
25|$|There were {{varying degrees}} of Romanization {{throughout}} Roman Dacia. The most Romanized segment was the region along the Danube, which was predominately under imperial administration, albeit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> was partially barbarized. The population beyond this zone, having lived with the Roman legions before their withdrawal, were substantially Romanized. The final zone, consisting of the northern portions of Maramures, Crisana, and Moldavia, stood {{at the edges of}} Roman Dacia. Although its people did not have Roman legions stationed among them, they were still nominally under the control of Rome, politically, socially, and economically. These were the areas in which resided the Carpi, {{often referred to as the}} Free Dacians.|$|E
25|$|Most {{examples}} of MOF-based catalysis {{make use of}} metal ions or atoms as active sites. Among the few exceptions are two nickel- and two copper-containing MOFs synthesized by Rosseinsky and co-workers. These compounds employ amino acids(L- or D-aspartate) together with dipyridyls as struts. The coordination chemistry is such that the amine group of the aspartate cannot be protonated by added HCl, {{but one of the}} aspartate carboxylates can. Thus, the framework-incorporated amino acid can exist <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> is not accessible for the free amino acid. While the nickel-based compounds are marginally porous, on account of tiny channel dimensions, the copper versions are clearly porous.|$|E

25|$|Some systems {{integrate}} a wet MRF {{to separate}} by density and flotation and to recover & wash the recyclable {{elements of the}} waste <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed refuse derived fuel (RDF). RDF {{can be used in}} cement kilns or thermal combustion power plants and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco Processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF. This is not the case and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.|$|E
25|$|Major League Quidditch (MLQ) {{was founded}} in 2015 as the sport's first {{exclusive}} league, {{with the goal of}} presenting quidditch <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> mirrors other sports' top leagues. MLQ features standardized schedules, high-level officiating, in-depth statistics and live or previously recorded footage of all games. The league included eight teams across the United States and Canada for its inaugural season in the summer of 2015, and expanded to 16 teams, composing four divisions, for its second season in the summer of 2016. For its third season in 2017, the league introduced practice squads behind the 16 teams, as well as developed a policy to allow league official teams to play unaffiliated teams.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} rainforests, {{eucalyptus}} woodland, mangrove forests, wallum and peat swamps, sand dunes and coastal heaths. It {{is made up}} of sand that has been accumulating for approximately 750,000 years on volcanic bedrock that provides a natural catchment for the sediment which is carried on a strong offshore current northwards along the coast. Unlike on many sand dunes, plant life is abundant due to the naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi present in the sand, which release nutrients <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>that</b> can be absorbed by the plants. Fraser Island is home to a small number of mammal species, as well as a diverse range of birds, reptiles and amphibians, including the occasional saltwater crocodile. The island is protected in the Great Sandy National Park.|$|E
