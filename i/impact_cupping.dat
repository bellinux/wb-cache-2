30|$|The {{finite element}} method is a useful tool to predict the {{behavior}} of EWF [3, 4]. Blanchet et al. [5] developed a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model of the hygromechanical cupping in layered wood composite flooring. The model was based on two sets of equations: (1) the three-dimensional equations of unsteady-state moisture diffusion and (2) the three-dimensional equations of elasticity including the orthotropic Hooke’s law which {{takes into account the}} shrinkage and swelling of each layer. Blanchet et al. [6] used this finite element model to support the design of EWF. They first demonstrated that at the macroscopic level, the hypothesis of elastic linearity is acceptable. Geometrical parameters and wood species properties were then used to assess different EWF construction. They found that the thickness and mechanical properties of the core layer are the most important design parameters controlling cupping deformation of EWF in service. They also indicated that the backing layer has a smaller, although still significant, <b>impact</b> on <b>cupping.</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionDual {{mobility}} cups {{are especially}} indicated in total hip replacement revision, {{the risk of}} recurrent instability being greater than in primary surgery. In revision, however, primary cup fixation is uncertain without routine anchoring screws. HypothesisThe stability of dual mobility <b>cups</b> <b>impacted</b> without cement, supplementary screw(s) or anchoring pegs fixation is satisfactory in total hip arthroplasty acetabular component revision, and prevents instability accidents. Patients and methodsTwenty three patients were operated on by the same surgeon between January 1999 and December 2006 and prospectively followed up to a mean 4 ½ years (range, 2 – 10 yrs). A Collégia™ cup (Wright Medical France, Créteil, France) was impacted in 23 total hip arthroplasty acetabular component revisions, including 17 cases of SOFCOT grade- 1 bone-stock loss and six of grade 2. ResultsThere were six clinically poor results on the Merle D’Aubigné scale. One case of early migration occurred, in a multioperated acetabulum. There was one isolated dislocation and one recurrent dislocation associated with loose greater trochanter nonunion, but tolerated as it was infrequent. DiscussionThis option simplifies revision surgery and limits the risk of dislocation if the abductor muscles unit is continuous. It is indicated when local bone-site compromise encompass a wall-contained cavitary defect at most. A medial wall defect, if moderate, does not in our view preclude using a primary <b>cup,</b> <b>impacted</b> with {{a certain degree of}} protrusion. Longer-term follow-up will be needed to confirm these medium-term findings. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Prospective non comparative therapeutic study...|$|R

40|$|Limitations {{associated}} with current {{total hip arthroplasty}} implants, such as aseptic loosening and dislocation, {{have led to the}} investigation into alternative bearing materials such as Carbon Fibre Reinforced PolyEtherEtherKetone (CFR-PEEK). There are reports of press-fit acetabular cups experiencing excessive deformation on impaction into the acetabulum which could lead to unfavourable conditions for bone in-growth and could adversely affect the lubrication regime of the bearing. This may have implications for the use of a reduced modulus material such as CFR-PEEK. The aim of this project was therefore to investigate the level of deformation the prototype Biomet UK Ltd CFR-PEEK cup experiences on impaction into the acetabulum and to assess the effect this deformation would have on the tribological behaviour of the system. In order to achieve this aim three different test regimes were considered; rim loading, impaction into polyurethane foam and impaction into cadaveric bone. In each case, corresponding finite element models were created. To assess the <b>impact</b> <b>cup</b> deformation would have on the lubrication regime of the ceramic-on-CFR-PEEK bearing, friction testing was conducted on cups with various clearances. This study has shown that that the polyurethane foam model is the most suitable method for assessing the level of cup deformation which occurs due to the impaction of a press fit acetabular cup. Testing using cadaveric specimens revealed a high level of variation in both the size of cavity produced by reaming and the level of deformation experienced by the cup. As a result cadaveric testing is unlikely to give a reliable worse case result. It was also found that rim loading is not a valid method for investigating the deformation on impaction of acetabular shells. In order to use rim loading, the load equivalent to that experienced on impaction would have to be found empirically for each individual cup design and size via imperial measurement. The Biomet CFR-PEEK cup experienced a large diametric deformation on impaction of up to 1. 084 mm. However, the large clearance between the head and the acetabular cup meant that the deformation of the PEEK cup did not result in jamming of the modular femoral head. The friction testing demonstrated that the bearing was insensitive to changes in clearance; therefore, provided the initial clearance is sufficient the deformation caused by press-fitting should not have an adverse effect on the friction and lubrication of the system...|$|R

5000|$|A typical jockstrap used in {{football}} is constructed {{of a wide}} elastic waistband with a support pouch of cotton/elastic to contain the genitals. Two wide elastic straps affixed {{to the base of}} the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip complete the jock. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an <b>impact</b> resistant <b>cup</b> (protective cup) to protect the testicles and penis from injury. Many youth football players, such as the Pop Warner leagues, are often required to wear a protective cup. However, they are now not worn as often at the high school, college, and peewee level, although still highly recommended.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} application, and identify complications, of the 2 nd generation of Zurich Cementless Total Hip Replacement (ZCTHR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n= 60) that had ZCTHR (n= 65). METHODS: Dogs with ZCTHR (2001 - 2003) with a minimum follow-up > or = 6 months were evaluated. Data included signalment, cup position, longest follow-up, complications, management of complications and outcome. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 22. 68 months. Eleven cases (17 %) had postoperative complications: femoral fracture (n= 1; 1. 5 %), prosthesis luxation (7; 11 %), cup loosening (2; 3 %), and implant failure (1; 1. 5 %); 9 cases were successfully revised. Explantation of implants was performed in 1 case because of infection, and 1 dog was euthanatized after reluxation. CONCLUSIONS: ZCTHR can restore function in dogs affected by disabling diseases of the coxofemoral joint. The press-fit fixation of the cup allowed for corrections in cases of incorrect positioning. Cases with aseptic loosening were revised successfully by <b>impacting</b> larger <b>cups.</b> Newer stems of this generation are shot peening treated to increase their resistance to breakage. In our cases, infection is a disastrous event, leading to implant removal. After resolution of complications, a successful final outcome was achieved in 97 % of THR.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} to {{study the effects of}} various rain properties on sand detachment resulting from raindrop <b>impact.</b> Splash <b>cups</b> were exposed to simulated rainfall intensities ranging between 10 and 140 mm h(- 1). The detached sand was collected and weighed whereas rain intensity, equivalent drop diameter and fall velocity of raindrops were measured with an optical spectro-pluviometer (OSP). The properties of the simulated rain (i. e, median volume diameter and kinetic energy) were compared with those observed in natural conditions. Statistical analyses have been undertaken in order to evaluate which rain variable best predicts the mass of sand detached. Linear and non-linear correlations between the mass of detached sediment and the product of drop size (d) by drop velocity (v), i. e. (DVbeta) -V-alpha, with values of alpha varying between 1 and 6 and beta between 0 and 3, have been computed. The results indicate that the coefficient of determination (R- 2) for alpha ranging between 3 and 5 and beta lower or equal to 2 are satisfying. Although kinetic energy ((DV 2) -V- 3) described splash detachment relatively well, the product of momentum by drop diameter (D- 4 V) was slightly superior in describing splash detachment. Therefore, the momentum multiplied by the drop diameter is recommended as the best rain Variable to describe splash detachment. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
