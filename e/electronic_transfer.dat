5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the <b>electronic</b> <b>transfer</b> of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E

25|$|As a {{prescription}} {{is nothing more}} than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transfer</b> of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E

It is also the system used in some payments made via a bank's online bill payment service. EFTS transfers differ from wire transfers in important legal ways. An EFTS payment is essentially an electronic personal check, whereas a wire transfer is more like an electronic cashier's check.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{the global}} {{kinetics}} and {{the exchange of}} protons and free solvent at the film/electrolyte interface were investigated when a PPy film doped with HPA (heteropolyanions) is polarized. The ionic and <b>electronic</b> <b>transfers</b> for the PPy-HPA system are fast because the determined values of the resistances are relatively low (a few ohms). Depending on the applied potential, the global kinetics is controlled by both the ionic and <b>electronic</b> <b>transfers.</b> The transport effects were neglected here because the prepared films were very thin. Protons {{play an important role}} in charge compensation whatever the imposed potential on the PPy-HPA film. This phenomenon results from the acidic-basic properties of the SiMo 12 O 404 - reduced species. A small quantity of water was also shown to be involved in the film reaction process...|$|R
