40|$|Conducting polymer {{actuators}} with favourable properties such as linearity, {{high power}} density and compliance are of increasing demand in micro applications. These materials generate forces over two {{times larger than}} produced by mammalian skeletal muscles. They operate to convert electro chemical energy to mechanical stress and strain. On the other hand, the application of conducting polymers {{is limited by the}} lack of a full description of the relation between four essential parameters: stress, strain, voltage and current. In this paper, polypyrrole <b>helix</b> <b>tube</b> micro actuator mechanical characteristics are investigated. The electrolyte is propylene carbonate and the dopant is TBA. PF 6. The experiments are both in isotonic and isometric conditions and the input parameters are both electrical and mechanical. A dual mode force and length control and potentiostat / galvanostat are utilized for this purpose. Ultimately, the viscoelastic behaviour of the actuator is presented in this paper by a standard stress relaxation test. The effect of electrical stimulus on mechanical parameters is also explored by cyclic voltametry at different scan rates to obtain the best understanding of the actuation mechanism. The results demonstrate that the linear viscoelastic model, which performed well on conducting polymer film actuators, has to be modified to explain the mechanical behaviour of PPy <b>helix</b> <b>tube</b> fibre micro actuators. Secondly, the changes in mechanical properties of PPy need to be considered when modelling electromechanical behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} (CP) are {{a promising}} {{area in the}} field of micro actuators, and have potential applications in micro robotics. Their properties are modelled as having an electro-chemical active component and a passive viscoelastic component. Methods exist to model the passive component as a configuration of springs and dashpots and the electro-active effects as a strain generator. Typically, the strain is assumed to be proportional to the charge transferred, and the two components are assumed to be independent. We show that there is a significant interaction between the two components for polypyrrole actuators, by observing the dynamic elastic modulus whilst varying the electric potential. The elastic modulus was measured in-situ by applying a high frequency rectangular isotonic stress input and recording the corresponding strain output. Two separate potential control inputs, vs. a reference electrode, were used. In the first experiment, a triangular voltage signal with variable frequency was applied to the PPy <b>helix</b> <b>tube</b> actuator and in the second experiment; a step voltage signal was applied to the actuator. The value of total real modulus was calculated during both experiments to evaluate the effect of actuation on the mechanical properties of PPy actuator. The performance of the mentioned method was confirmed by comparing its results to that of a sinusoidal stress input during a temperature ramp through the glass transition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). We show that polypyrrole actuators show a complex change in stiffness with contractile state, which mimic skeletal muscle [1]...|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to develop actuator technologies such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric actuators, magnetostrictive actuators, contractile polymers and electrostatic actuators to use in devices such as human-like robots, micro robots and artificial organs for medical applications place of conventional actuators. Though there have been great advances, one or more of high electrical power, low efficiency or low strain limit the application of these new actuator technologies. Recently, conducting polymers have drawn considerable attention as a new class of advanced functional material for many applications based on the unique properties of electro-activity, conductivity and other physical or chemical properties. The applications being considered include batteries, photovoltaic devices, electro-chromic devices, ion selective membranes, electromagnetic interference shielding, radar absorption, electrical wires, corrosion inhibitors, electrochemical sensors and actuators. For actuator applications a comprehensive electro-chemo-mechanical model is needed to predict the mechanical output (displacement or force) from the electrical input (current and voltage) to enable control engineers to use these actuators in mechanical systems, new models which describe the dynamic response (actuator output/actuator input) as a function of time and frequency are required. The research in this thesis shows how such models can be derived by exploiting standard control theory analysis tools using Laplace transforms and State-Space techniques. For conducting polymers, such a model needs to include a description of the chemical process occurring between the conducting polymer, dopant and electrolyte. Such a model will enable the application of conducting polymer actuators in automation and robotic applications in which a predictive model is needed to design the control system and also identify the system performance to optimise the actuator characteristics. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to create a comprehensive predictive model in order to track the output of a typical high- performance conducting polymer actuator: Polypyrrole <b>Helix</b> <b>Tube</b> Fibre Composite Actuator. The review of literature has revealed that previous models of polypyrrole actuators have meter, which has been assumed to be constant. In this work, it is shown that the strain to charge ratio is not always constant, particularly when a wide potential window is used. A master calibration curve approach has been devised to model the mechanical output when the strain to charge ratio is not constant. Secondly, the polypyrrole helix tubes were found to be viscoelastic, so the model was modified to include the viscoelastic (time-dependent) responses. Finally, the model was further modified to allow the viscoelastic parameters to vary with the applied potential. The latter two additions to the model greatly improve its predictive ability when the applied load is changing. To further investigate the effect of applied potential on the mechanical properties, a measurement method based on Quartz Crystal Microbalance technique has been developed. This method enables the thickness and shear modulus variation of polypyrrole thin films under electrochemical doping and un-doping (oxidation and reduction) to be studied. A complicated modulus shifting phenomenon in polypyrrole is revealed by these studies which depend strongly on the electrolyte. Finally, the results present a full description of the electromechanical characterisation of polypyrrole helix tubes considering the interacting effects of electrochemical and electromechanical parameters.

The model is one-dimensional, with beam electrons represented as rigid disks. Multifrequency inter-actions are supported and the RF circuit can be optionally repre-sented with cold-test data, a sheath helix model, or a recently im-plemented tape helix model [2]. Simulations using the tape helix model are shown to be in good agreement with experimental mea-surements of an L-band TWT over a broad (250 -MHz) frequency range. In the intermediate and saturated power regimes, the mod-eled and measured TWT gain versus frequency agree to better than 0. 4 dB, with deviations explained by strong reflections at the output window that are not accounted for in the code. Single-tone exper-imental and simulated drive curves agree to better than 1 dB in the small- and large-signal regimes; relative phase shift simula-tions agree to within experimental measurement accuracy in the small-signal regime and to within 75 % in the large-signal regime.

A deeper understanding has been gained on how the basic parameters of a TWT affect its non-linear performance. By selecting and controlling the parameters that are critical to the amplifier’s nonlinear performance the designs corresponding to the important and desired conditions have been identified. The main simulation tool for modelling the interaction processes in a generic helix TWT was a large-signal model (LSM). A helix slow-wave structure is normally tapered to maintain its phase relationship with the electron beam and to maximise its output RF power. By determining the sensitivity of the helix dimensions on the nonlinear performance at different regions along the tube, a non-uniform slow-wave structure design has been developed for a more linear performance. Since the conditions of high linearity and efficiency could not be achieved simultaneously, the best trade-off was attained. The performance across the frequency band of 10. 7 to 12. 75 GHz was computed for the uniform and tapered helix designs. With the use of a simulated multi-stage collector with optimised electrodes, the overall TWT performance was determined.
