My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but how do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E

And, so saying, she changed her shape into that of a lion, and {{throwing}} the queen across her back, she went down the ten thousand steps that led to her palace. The lion had reached {{the centre of the}} earth before she stopped in front of a house, lighted with lamps, and built {{on the edge of a}} lake of quicksilver. In this lake various huge monsters might be seen playing or fighting--the queen did not know which--and around flew rooks and ravens, uttering dismal croaks. In the distance was a mountain down whose sides waters slowly coursed--these were the tears of unhappy lovers--and nearer the gate were trees without either fruit of flowers, while nettles and brambles covered the ground. If the castle had been gloomy, what did the queen <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> ...|$|E

And that's just why I plead with you now to ignore them. You have given proof long ago of your devotion to the right. You may surely fall back this second time upon the easier way of {{ordinary}} humanity. In theory, Herminia, I accept your point of view; I approve the equal liberty of men and women, politically, socially, personally, ethically. But in practice, I don't want to bring unnecessary trouble on the head of a woman I love; and to live together otherwise than as the law directs does bring unnecessary trouble, as you know too profoundly.

One knows very little of anything in the world till trouble comes. You know how it is with flowers and trees; in the early spring they look so quiet and self-contained; then all in a moment they change--I think it must be like that with the heart. I used to think I knew a great deal, understood why and how things came about; I thought self-possession and reason so easy; now I know nothing. And nothing in the world matters but to see you and hide away from that look in Uncle Nic's eyes. Three months ago I did not know you, now I write like this.

60|$|Nevertheless, {{what his}} art can {{honestly}} {{do to make}} you feel as much as he wants you to <b>feel,</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fire, he will do; and that studiously. That the fire be luminous or not, is no matter just now. But that the fire is hot, he would have you to know. Now, will you notice what colours he has used in the whole picture. First, the blue background, necessary to unite it with the other three subjects, is reduced to the smallest possible space. St. Francis must be in grey, for that is his dress; also the attendant of one of the Magi is in grey; but so warm, that, if you saw it by itself, you would call it brown. The shadow behind the throne, which Giotto knows he can paint, and therefore does, is grey also. The rest of the picture [Footnote: The floor has been repainted; but though its grey is now heavy and cold, it cannot kill the splendour of the rest.] in at least six-sevenths of its area--is either crimson, gold, orange, purple, or white, all as warm as Giotto could paint them; and set off by minute spaces only of intense black,--the Soldan's fillet at the shoulders, his eyes, beard, and the points necessary in the golden pattern behind. And the whole picture is one glow.|$|E

Well, I shall tell you exactly how I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> matter. From the first moment I saw you I felt drawn towards you, I felt that I couldn't help admiring you and sympathising with you and loving you. If I dared I would have spoken to you that day at Iffley; but I said to myself [...] "She will not care for me; and besides, it would be wrong of me to ask her just yet." [...] I had nothing to live upon, and I oughtn't to ask you to wait for me--you who are so pretty, and sweet and good, and clever--I ought to leave you free to your natural prospect of marrying some better man, who would make you happier than I can ever hope to do. So I tried to put the impulse aside; I waited, saying to myself that if you really cared for me a little bit, you would still care for me when I came to Calcombe Pomeroy. But then my natural selfishness overcame me--you can forgive me for it, Edie; how could I help it when I had once seen you? I began to be afraid some other man would be beforehand with you; and I liked you so much I couldn't bear to think of the chance that you might be taken away from me before I asked you. All day long, as I've been walking alone on those high grey moors at Dunbude, I've been thinking of you; and at last I made up my mind that I MUST come and ask you to be my wife--some time--whenever we could afford to marry. I know I'm asking you to make a great sacrifice for me; it's more than I have any right to ask you; I'm ashamed of myself for asking it; I can only make you a poor man's wife, and how long I may have to wait even for that I can't say; but if you'll only consent to wait for me, Edie, I'll do the best that lies in me to make you as happy and to love you as well as any man on earth could ever do.' ...|$|E
