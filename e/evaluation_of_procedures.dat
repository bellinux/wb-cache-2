40|$|Abstract ⎯ In several {{research}} areas, {{virtual reality}} environments {{have been constructed}} for training objectives. The goal is to immerge the user into a virtual world to provide realistic training and realistic interactions. However, {{it is important to}} know the quality of training to provide a status of the user performance. An online evaluation system allows the user to improve his/her learning because it can identify, immediately after the training, where he/she committed mistakes or presented low efficiency. To evaluate the user’s performance it is necessary collect data from training. In some applications, data collected from user’s interaction cannot be adequate to classical statistical distributions. To solve that problem we propose the use of Neural Networks to online <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> in virtual reality simulators. This approach is very simple and it can be used for Web-based simulation evaluation, using plug-ins or agents to collect information about the different variables of user’s simulations...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} and <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for examination of fecal specimens for botulinal toxin and Clostridium botulinum {{have provided the}} means by which infant botulism can be recognized. The toxicity for mice of fecal extracts containing botulinal toxin can be neutralized with specific botulinal antitoxin. The presence of C. botulinum in the feces is detected by demonstrating the presence of botulinal toxin in enrichment culture supernatant by means of toxicity tests in mice. C. botulinum is isolated by streaking enrichment cultures on egg yolk agar and picking typical lipase-positive colonies. The experience of both the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Botulism Laboratory and other laboratories has been that botulinal toxin and C. botulinum are rarely, if ever, found in the feces of hu-mans (infants or older people) not afflicted with botulism. Results of the examina· tion in the CDC laboratory of specimens from 24 babies with infant botulism are given.
