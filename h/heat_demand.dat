The City of Vienna serves {{as a case study}} to explore potentials to improve the urban heat supply using waste heat as an additional energy source. As no observation data about waste heat and detailed <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> is available, this data is derived from proxy data for estimating waste heat reuse potential and residential <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> patterns. <b>Heat</b> requirements for manufacturing and service provision is explored and, based on the distribution of the companies within the city, mapped as waste heat sources.

Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> coverage through local waste heat in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by waste heat supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide waste heat. In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna’s outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> near the sources can be covered by waste heat within a 250 m distance.

The heat pump system can be designed as stand-alone systems, i. e. a heat pump water heater (HPWH) in combination with separate units for space heating, or be an integrated unit for combined space heating and hot water heating (IHPS). Due to compact design, the latter system is most likely to achieve the lowest investment and installation costs and with that the best profitability. Integrated residential heat pump systems using carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) as a working fluid can achieve high Coefficient of Performance (COP) due to the unique characteristics of the transcritical cycle with heat rejection in a gas cooler at a gliding CO 2 temperature.

40|$|Abstract—To {{design a}} {{building}} that fulfills requirements regarding low energy use, {{it is crucial to}} perform energy simulations of the building in question during the design process and the simulations must be representative of the building during operation. All countries within the European Union will require new buildings to be nearly zero energy buildings beginning in 2019. In nearly zero energy buildings and passive houses, the user related energy uses, household electricity and domestic hot water heating, make up about 80 % of the total energy use since the use of space heating is low. The building's <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> is affected by the occupants’ use of domestic hot water and household electricity. Increased use of domestic hot water increases the <b>heating</b> <b>demand,</b> while a high use of household electricity can reduce the <b>heating</b> <b>demand.</b> Different user characteristics will result in different <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> in the same building, and in low energy buildings, different user characteristics will have a relatively higher impact compared to less energy efficient buildings. There is a lack of studies that analyze resulting energy use of dwellings based on distribution of measured user related input data. The aim of this paper was to annually measure household electricity and domestic hot water volume in 562 apartments, present the measured distributions and analyze the influence on the apartment <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> of energy efficient buildings and typical buildings by use of simulations of the building physics and the building services. The results show that, in order to predict the energy use of energy efficient residential buildings, with a reasonable accuracy, the different users’ characteristics regarding household electricity and domestic hot water must be taken into account. Furthermore, to determine the impact that different users will have on a building's <b>heating</b> <b>demand,</b> the analysis must be based on the actual building and the result should be given as a distribution rather than as a single figure...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a global effort to reduce dependency on carbon-based fuels and move towards more sustainable practices utilizing renewable energy sources. This is {{in part due to}} the detrimental effects to the environment and climate change caused by the procurement and combustion of these fuels. Buildings account for a significant portion of global final energy use for heating and cooling purposes. This work focuses on the agricultural greenhouse sector in a cold climate, where significant <b>heating</b> <b>demands</b> are present and are typically met by utilizing significant amounts of natural gas. The <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> of these structures is examined as well as sustainable generation concepts that have the potential to reduce this dependency on carbon-based fuels. Chapter II investigates the potential of closed greenhouse systems in a cold climate, where active cooling is implemented and the heat removed is stored for later use. It is determined that the annual cooling demand is equal to or greater than the <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> in each of the cold climates examined and the use of a high-insulating cover material would be most suitable due to the significant reduction in annual <b>heating</b> <b>demand.</b> Chapter III analyses the ability of a large-scale solar collector system to cover {{a significant portion of the}} greenhouse <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> during the summer months. It is determined that a solar collector system with total area of ~ 575 m 2 is able to cover 97 % of the <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> during the month of July and approximately 27 % of the annual demand of a 0. 4 hectare greenhouse. By replacing natural gas CO 2 equivalent emissions are reduced by about 95 tonnes/ year and a payback period of about 10 years is achievable with carbon tax at a rate of $ 200 / tonne of CO 2 equivalent emissions. Finally, Chapter IV simulates the performance of a large-scale solar collector system with seasonal thermal energy storage (STES), where year-round heat is supplied by the system. High and low-temperature systems are able to cover approximately 64 % of the annual <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> and achieve a system coefficient of performance of about 21. 7 and 2. 9, respectively. The systems are able to reduce CO 2 equivalent emissions by ~ 220 tonnes / year and a payback period of about 7 years is achievable with a 70 % subsidy and carbon tax at a rate $ 200 / tonne of CO 2 equivalent emissions...|$|R

50|$|After declaring {{independence}} from the Soviet Union, the Baltic States of Lithuania and Latvia were left with an energy sector that was heavily reliant on imported gas, oil, and nuclear fuel sources. In 1996, when the plant project was appraised, domestic energy sources supplied only 2% of Lithuania's <b>heat</b> <b>demand.</b> The states began considering renewable energy projects in response. Between 1992 and 1994 the Government of Denmark financed {{a study of the}} geothermal potential in Lithuania and Latvia called Baltic Geothermal Energy Project. Regional aquifers within the Devonian and Cambrian strata were analyzed along with the energy needs and geothermal potential of 12 urban areas: Klaipėda, Palanga, Šiauliai, Šilalė, Šilutė, Gargzdai, Radviliškis, and Joniškis in Lithuania, and Liepāja, Riga, Jūrmala, and Jelgava in Latvia. On the basis of this project's findings and other investigations, Klaipėda was chosen as a pilot location. The World Bank had estimated the plant would reduce annual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 47,800 tons and nitrogen dixodes (NOX) by 1 ton if it replaced natural gas as a fuel, and reduce CO2 emissions by 51,940 tons, NOX by 11 tons, and sulfur dioxides by 1,160 tons per year if it additionally replaced heavy fuel oil.

The criteria for the refurbishment measures that were investigated were mainly: not extreme costs, comfort for the residents during the construction and the possibility to generalize the solution for more buildings. CAPSOL models were created for the calculation of the <b>heating</b> <b>demand</b> in the exiting situation and the refurbishment solutions. The result of this modeling was that the building has to be fully refurbished in order for it to achieve both high thermal comfort and low <b>heating</b> <b>demand.</b> Passive measures, like second skin façade and closed-off balcony, work better than external insulation, especially if they are south oriented. The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated both form the <b>heating</b> <b>demands</b> and by calculating the embedded energy of the materials used in each refurbishment solution.
