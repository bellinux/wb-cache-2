60|$|This was {{difficult}} to answer, and Gertrude did not attempt it; her prejudices were stronger than her powers of reasoning. Looking southward, she saw the turreted tops of the Sebastian elevators rising from the sea of grass like cathedral towers. Their smallness emphasized {{the vastness of the}} plain, which was beginning to have a stimulating effect on her mind. She thought it might explain the broadness of her companion's views, which, while erroneous, were becoming comprehensible. He lived in the open, beyond the bounds of walls and fences, breathing this wonderful invigorating air. Nevertheless, he was obviously a man of varied and extensive information, which struck her as somewhat curious in face of his severely practical abilities. He could mend harness, plow a straight <b>furrow,</b> <b>break</b> horses, and strip a complicated machine. As a new type, he deserved attention.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground-breaking}} {{ceremony for}} the girls' dorm {{took place on}} February 18, 1946. This was the first building to be erected at the academy. After the program, Principal Hartman took the controls of a caterpillar tractor and Missouri Conference President Hutches guided the plow. Farm manager Herschel Turner drove a team of Missouri mules with veteran minister and Bible teacher C. M. Babcock holding another plow. The two teams ploughed some <b>furrows,</b> <b>breaking</b> the ground in preparation for laying {{the foundation of the}} new building. By September 30, both red-brick dormitories were complete, and the first school year began with an enrollment of 125. Teachers held classes in the dormintories, and the hayloft of the barn served as an assembly hall.|$|R
40|$|We {{build an}} image {{analysis}} toolbox for high-throughput Drosophila embryo RNAi screens. The {{goal is to}} tag the embryo as normal, developmentally delayed or abnormal based on the ventral <b>furrow</b> formation. We <b>break</b> the problem into two parts: in the first, we detect the developmental stage based {{on the progress of}} the ven-tral furrow formation, and in the second, we tag the embryo as nor-mal/developmentally delayed/abnormal based on the stage detected and the elapsed time. The crux of the algorithm is the multiresolu-tion classifier, and we show that, by classifying in multiresolution spaces, we obtain better results than by classifying the embryo im-age alone. The final 2 D accuracy obtained was 93. 17 %, while by using 3 D information, it increased to 98. 35 %. Index Terms — High-throughput, screening, Drosophila, classi-fication, multiresolutio...|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{cutting and}} turning {{the soil to}} produce ridged <b>furrows,</b> the ard <b>breaks</b> up a narrow strip of soil and cuts a shallow furrow (or drill), leaving {{intervening}} strips undisturbed. The ard is not suited for clearing new land, so grass and undergrowth are usually removed with hoes or mattocks. Cross-ploughing is often necessary to break the soil up better, where the soil is tilled twice {{at right angles to}} the original direction (lengthwise and across). This usually results in square or diamond-shaped fields and is effective at clearing annual weeds. The ard's shallow furrows are ideal for most cereals, and if the seed is sown broadcast, the ard can be used to cover the seed in rows. In fact, the ard may have been invented in the Near East to cover seed rather than till. That would explain why in Mesopotamia seed drills were used together with ards. The ard is most useful on light soils such as loams or sands, or in mountain fields where the soil is thin, and can be safely used in areas where deep ploughing would turn up hardpan or would cause salination or erosion.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundDuring cell division, {{chromosomes}} must {{clear the}} path of the cleavage furrow before the onset of cytokinesis. The abscission checkpoint in mammalian cells stabilizes the cleavage furrow {{in the presence of a}} chromatin obstruction. This provides time to resolve the obstruction before the cleavage <b>furrow</b> regresses or <b>breaks</b> the chromosomes, preventing aneuploidy or DNA damage. Two unanswered questions in the proposed mechanistic pathway of the abscission checkpoint concern factors involved in (1) resolving the obstructions and (2) coordinating obstruction resolution with the delay in cytokinesis. ResultsWe found that the one-cell and two-cell C.  elegans embryos suppress furrow regression following depletion of essential chromosome-segregation factors: topoisomerase IITOP- 2, CENP-AHCP- 3, cohesin, and to a lesser degree, condensin. Chromatin obstructions activated Aurora BAIR- 2 at the spindle midzone, which is needed for the abscission checkpoint in other systems. Condensin I, but not condensin II, localizes to the spindle midzone in anaphase and to the midbody during normal cytokinesis. Interestingly, condensin I is enriched on chromatin bridges and near the midzone/midbody in an AIR- 2 -dependent manner. Disruption of AIR- 2, the spindle midzone, or condensin leads to cytokinesis failure in a chromatin-obstruction-dependent manner. Examination of the condensin-deficient embryos uncovered defects in both the resolution of the chromatin obstructions and the maintenance of the stable cleavage furrow. ConclusionsWe postulate that condensin I is recruited by Aurora BAIR- 2 to aid in the resolution of chromatin obstructions and also helps generate a signal to maintain the delay in cytokinesis...|$|R
