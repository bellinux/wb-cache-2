25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> {{which consisted of}} 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, IBM {{publicly}} {{announced the}} IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, {{the first in}} its successful 700/7000 series and its first IBM mainframe computer. The IBM 704, introduced in 1954, used magnetic core memory, which became the standard for large machines. IBM introduced the first <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> the IBM 350 RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) in 1956. Using fifty [...] metal disks, with 100tracks per side, {{it was able to}} store 5megabytes of data at a cost of US$10,000 per megabyte ($ as of [...] ).|$|E

[...] Next to the fixed <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable <b>disk</b> data <b>storage</b> <b>units.</b> A removable <b>disk</b> pack can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.|$|R

5000|$|Most DW {{appliances}} use {{massively parallel}} processing (MPP) architectures to provide high query performance and platform scalability. MPP architectures consist of independent processors or servers executing in parallel. Most MPP architectures implement a [...] "shared-nothing architecture" [...] where each server operates self-sufficiently and controls its own memory and disk. DW appliances distribute data onto dedicated <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> connected to each server in the appliance. This distribution allows DW appliances {{to resolve a}} relational query by scanning data on each server in parallel. The divide-and-conquer approach delivers high performance and scales linearly as new servers are added into the architecture.|$|R
30|$|A {{consensus}} on parallel and distributed database system architecture {{emerged in the}} 1990 ’s. This architecture {{was based on a}} shared-nothing hardware design [98] in which processors communicate with one another only by sending messages via a network. In such systems, tuples of each relation in the database were partitioned (declustered) across <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> attached directly to each processor. Partitioning allowed multiple processors to scan large relations in parallel without the need for any exotic I/O devices. Such architectures were pioneered by Teradata in the late seventies, and by several research projects. This design is used by Teradata, Tandem, NCR, Oracle-nCUBE, and several other products. The research community adopted this shared-nothing dataflow architecture in systems like Arbre, Bubba, and Gamma.|$|R
50|$|BESYS (Bell Operating System) was {{an early}} {{computing}} environment originally implemented as a batch processing operating system in 1957 at Bell Labs for the IBM 704 computer. The initial version of the system BESYS2 was created by George H. Mealy and Gwen Hansen with Wanda Lee Mammel {{under the guidance of}} Victor A. Vyssotsky and utilized IBM's FORTRAN and North American's symbolic assembly program (SAP) programming languages. It was designed to efficiently deal with a large number of jobs originating on punched cards and producing results suitable for printing on paper and punched cards. The system also provided processing capabilities for data stored on magnetic tapes and magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units.</b> Typically punched card and print processing was handled off line by peripheral Electronic Accounting Machines, IBM 1401 computers, and eventually direct coupled computers.|$|R
50|$|The {{access time}} ranges from 100ms {{to a maximum}} access time for model 2 of 800ms and 700ms for model 1.

5000|$|The IBM 1405 <b>Disk</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit</b> was {{announced}} in 1961 and was designed for use with the IBM 1400 series, medium scale business computers. [...] The 1405 Model 1 has a storage capacity of 10 million alphanumeric characters (60,000,000 bits) on 25 disks. Model 2 has a storage capacity of 20 million alphanumeric characters (120,000,000 bits) on 50 disks. In both models the disks were stacked vertically on a shaft rotating at 1200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Hard {{disk drives}} {{to this date}} follow the 350 <b>Disk</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit.</b> They are used as the main {{components}} for storage on today’s personal computers. Similar to floppy disks, the data on hard drives are read and written via a spindle. Hard disk drives have many times more storage space than the IBM 350 due to considerable innovations in storage space densities on disks. Kryder's Law, similar to Moore's Law, indicates that storage space doubles on an annual basis.|$|E
