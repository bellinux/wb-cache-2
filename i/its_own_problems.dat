The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E

Years of effort in obscurity took their toll, and almost ended his ambitions as a composer: [...] "I was beaten down", he wrote later, [...] "My own students gave me advice – how to compose, how to speak through the orchestra". Success in 1916 – when Karel Kovařovic finally decided to perform Jenůfa in Prague – brought <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>problems.</b> Janáček grudgingly resigned himself to the changes forced upon his work.

On his return to Brno, he appears not to have concealed his new passion from Zdenka, who responded by attempting suicide. Janáček was furious with Zdenka and tried to instigate a divorce, but lost interest in Horvátová.

This location presented <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>problems</b> for the crew, as the swampy waters of the river slowed production as well as the limited daylight available—in November, there is only six hours of daylight in the Pitt Meadow's region.

The location that was scouted for the river scene, where Emily Dinsmore pushes Lana off a bridge and into a river, became problematic on the first day of shooting. The river had become too dangerous to shoot the water scenes, so they simply tied Kreuk to a safety line and had Jodelle Micah Ferland (Emily) push her over the edge, but without her actually going into the water. They moved the set to a sound stage where they filmed Kreuk's remaining scenes—where Tom Welling dives into the river to save her—in a water tank.|$|E

[...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit.

[...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it.
