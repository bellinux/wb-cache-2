40|$|Idiopathic IgA {{nephropathy}} with segmental necrotizing lesions of the capillary wall. BackgroundSegmental glomerular necrosis {{has been}} described in the biopsy material in a minority of patients with idiopathic IgA nephropathy in the oldest studies on this disease, but this marker of active capillaritis has received little attention in the subsequent literature, and its significance and relevance for the clinical outcome is still unknown. MethodsThirty-five out of 340 patients (10. 3 %) biopsied in our division at the San Carlo Hospital since 1974 showed active segmental necrotizing lesions. The morphological features and {{the natural history of}} this group of patients were compared with those of a control group of 229 patients who had comparable serum creatinine and extent of glomerular sclerosis, but who lacked active segmental necrosis. ResultsPatients with the necrotic variant showed a significantly more marked extracapillary proliferation and interstitial accumulation of monocytes and T lymphocytes and, in the segmental areas of necrotizing and extracapillary lesions, infiltration of monocytes, deposition of fibrinogen, and expression of the adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1. No difference was found in the presenting clinical syndrome. The clinical course was frequently characterized by acute <b>flareups,</b> and the progression to end-stage renal failure was more frequent, although actuarial renal survival was not significantly worse (P = 0. 07). The aggressive treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide, carried out in 20 of the 35 patients, has probably been beneficial, justifying the multicenter controlled trial that recently has been initiated. ConclusionsVasculitic lesions of the glomerular capillaries, with histologic and immunohistological features similar to those of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive renal vasculitis, were found in 10 % of patients with idiopathic IgAN. Clinical features at presentation did not differ from those of the other patients with IgAN, and despite of the more frequent occurrences of recurrent acute <b>flareups,</b> rapid progression to end-stage renal failure was a rare phenomenon, even in untreated patients...|$|R
2500|$|The {{scope of}} the {{expedition}} expanded beyond the original plans, leaving the participants inadequately prepared for a trip tracing the River of Doubt from its source through hundreds of kilometers of uncharted rainforest.

Roosevelt's father contracted malaria and a serious infection resulting from a minor leg wound, weakening him {{to the point that}} he considered taking a fatal dose of morphine rather than being a burden to his companions. Roosevelt told his father that he was bringing him back literally [...] "dead or alive" [...] and if he died, he would be an even bigger burden to the expedition.

50|$|Nickel {{is present}} {{in a wide range}} of foods, in varying concentrations. Exposure to nickel through one's diet may result in acute ({{systemic}}) <b>flareups</b> of Ni-ACD. Adults should consume less than 150μg of nickel per day, and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. Whilst systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1-10% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals orally given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.|$|R

40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the physical processes of star formation is reviewed, with emphasis on processes occurring in molecular clouds like those observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density peak that evolves toward a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behavior. The result is that a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion {{at a rate that}} is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing angular momentum and driving episodes of disk accretion. Variable accretion may account for some peculiarities of young stars such as <b>flareups</b> and jet production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes in very dense environments.
