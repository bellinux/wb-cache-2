The {{aim is to}} ensure that protection of natural forests, biodiversity and human rights, including the rights of forest-dependent communities, are top priorities, not only rhetorically but also in fact and in funding. Indeed, as stated by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), [...] "RFN has played an active role in influencing [...] government policies and priorities on both [...] as recognised by Norad". The Norwegian government's [...] is a key target for RFN's advocacy work in Norway, since Norway has taken a leading role in worldwide rainforest protection. This work also has broader significance, as it affects the development of national REDD+ policies and instruments, as well as national REDD+ policies in RFN's project countries.|$|E
2500|$|Lange {{was imprisoned}} at Møllergata 19 in September 1940 for {{getting into a}} fight at Theatercaféen with Eyvind Mehle, an {{associate}} of Vidkun Quisling. The incident happened the day after Mehle had attacked King Haakon VII in a speech. Lange refused to greet Mehle when he came past his table, responding that [...] "I don't greet Norway's greatest turd in another way than this," [...] and then slapped Mehle in the face. Lange thereafter grabbed Mehle and threw him through a door twice. Lange refused to apologise to Mehle, and was captured by German police the following day. Lange was imprisoned for four months, and was released in early 1941. His house was searched several times by the Gestapo {{when he was in}} prison. On other occasions, Lange and his family also hid Norwegians who planned to escape to Sweden in their house. Following his release from prison, Lange assisted resistance members with <b>information</b> <b>work.</b> He thus came under investigation by the police, as he was [...] "known for being an opponent of NS." [...] In 1942 he was captured and imprisoned once more at Møllergata 19 after his house was raided by German police. It was during his times in prison that Lange started thinking seriously about practical politics. He was according to himself not tortured or abused in prison, but to his satisfaction he was left alone to just read books and think.|$|E
