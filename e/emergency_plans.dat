In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks.

Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|The IMD issued {{warnings}} {{related to}} the cyclone that were distributed to the public by television, telegraph, news outlets, and other government departments. The All India Radio broadcast warnings beginning on November5, the day before landfall. Train service was disrupted throughout Andhra Pradesh, stranding thousands of travelers. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm. The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled. It ultimately struck about 50km (30mi) north of where it was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters. About 225,000families evacuated due to the storm. However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape. Some residents avoided the shelters due to their state of disrepair, or stayed in their homes for fear they would be robbed.

40|$|Emergency {{response}} combines with {{prevention and}} mitigation {{to form the}} risk management triad of control measures for reducing chemical accident risks. In fact, standard good practice dictates that appropriate emergency response measures are identified for every major accident scenario of a hazardous operation. Consistent with this philosophy, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> has been taken on board as {{an essential component of}} the Seveso Directive since its inception in 1982. Within the current Seveso Directive (2012 / 18 /EU), under Article 12, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> for upper-tier sites is assigned as a direct obligation to both the operator (for internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning)</b> and the authorities (for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning).</b> These obligations present considerable challenges for the authorities, in particular, in verifying that internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> of each upper tier site is conducted in accordance with Seveso requirements and existing performance standard; that a parallel process for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> is established; and an appropriate strategy is defined to inform populations potentially at risk from the accident scenarios of concern. To bring improvements and consistency to Member State practices in this regard, the European Commission and the Irish Health and Safety Authority organised a workshop in 2012 for Seveso inspectors from EU and aligned countries to exchange information on challenges and successes in implementing <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> obligations.

500|$|..... a basic {{principle}} of triage {{is to treat}} victims having the most life-threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel {{in a manner that}} will provide maximum effectiveness. However, the Safety Board is also aware that in recent years a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully resuscitated. They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, titled [...] "Deadly Choices", focuses on the events that {{occurred}} at Memorial Medical Center over the [...] "five days" [...] referred to in the book's title: August 28 – September 1, 2005. During these five days, Memorial's <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> proved inadequate as the hospital lost power and its back-up generators had failed, leaving it without lights, air conditioning, sewer systems and essential medical equipment. Thousands of staff, patients and evacuees were trapped by floodwaters inside the building awaiting evacuation by boat or helicopter. Fink describes the unconventional method of triage adopted by the medical staff, whereby ambulatory patients were prioritized for evacuation and those with [...] "do not resuscitate" [...] orders were placed last in the list. Patient evacuation began on the third day and progressed slowly until the fifth day, when some medical staff decided to hasten the deaths of critically ill patients, believing they would not survive, with lethal injections of morphine. The story is described from the perspective of several participants, pieced together from interviews, emails and phone logs.|$|E
500|$|Volcanic eruptions in Canada rarely cause {{fatalities}} {{because of}} their remoteness and low level of activity. The only known fatality due to volcanic activity in Canada occurred at the Tseax Cone in 1775, when a [...] lava flow traveled down the Tseax and Nass Rivers, destroying a Nisga'a village and killing approximately 2,000 people by volcanic gases. Towns and cities south of Silverthrone are home to well over half of British Columbia's human population, {{and there is a}} likelihood that future eruptions will cause damage to populated areas, making Silverthrone and other Garibaldi belt volcanoes further south a major potential hazard. For this reason, additional projects to study Silverthrone and other Garibaldi belt volcanoes to the south are being planned by the Geological Survey of Canada. There are significant hazards from almost all Canadian volcanoes that require hazard maps and <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Volcanoes which exhibit significant seismic activity, such as Silverthrone, appear to be most likely to erupt. A significant eruption of any of the Garibaldi belt volcanoes would significantly impact Highway 99 and communities like Pemberton, Whistler and Squamish, and possibly Vancouver.|$|E
