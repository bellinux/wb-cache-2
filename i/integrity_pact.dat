It has been known that National Examination is still debatable. Many disagree {{to do it because}} the final evaluation must be returned to the teachers. Whereas, government agrees to do so in order to standardize the result of teaching learning process. To guarantee fair play in the exam, all headmasters sign <b>integrity</b> <b>pact.</b> Therefore, students are motivated to study hard to pass the exam. Unfortunately, many students even their teachers and headmasters cheat in many ways to achieve high results.

40|$|Since 1995, the anti-corruption {{movement}} has had success {{in developing a}} global legal framework to combat transnational bribery and corruption. A distinguishing feature of the current anti-corruption movement is its emphasis on the economic cost of corruption and {{the involvement of the}} international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and regional development banks, in the efforts to combat corruption. As part of their efforts to combat corruption, international financial institutions have made effective anti-corruption reforms a prerequisite for future allocation of funds. The current anti-corruption {{movement has}} also been successful in enlisting the participation of sectors of international and domestic civil society, as well as the business community, through <b>integrity</b> <b>pacts</b> and codes of conduct. Notwithstanding its relative success, the current anti-corruption movement faces serious hurdles as incidences of transnational corruption keep rising. On a philosophical level, the economic repackaging of the problem of corruption has made the anti-corruption effort more acceptable by excluding any explicit moral judgments that may lead to charges of moral or legal imperialism; however, the re-packaging is proving to be inadequate given the irrefutable moral and ethical dimension of corruption. Increasingly, scholars of international business ethics, as well as anti-corruption advocates, are emphasizing a “virtues’’ approach to combating corruption. The failure of the anti-corruption movement may also contribute to the de-legitimization of the “science” of economics. On a more practical level is the difficulty of distinguishing among different categories of illicit payments, such as a facilitation payment that can be legal; a bribe, which is illegal, and maintaining a favorable climate payment, which may be legal or illegal. Finally, the current anti-corruption movement must address the legacy of colonialism and its impact on how developing countries view anti-corruption efforts. For centuries, corruption has been associated with the East and anti-corruption with the West. Making free markets, rule of law, and democratic reforms a part of the anti-corruption campaign may lead to the perpetuation of the rule of geographical morality and the imposition of Western values. To some, this approach opens the anti-corruption movement to charges of neo-colonialism...|$|R
40|$|Corruption {{is defined}} as private {{individuals}} or enterprises who misuse public resources for private power and/or political gains. They do so through abusing public officials whose behavior deviates from the formal government rules of conduct. Ethical behavior {{is defined as}} individuals or enterprises adhering to a non-corrupt work or business practice. A review of the academic literature is conducted drawing on perspectives from the political, economic, and anthropological sciences. Insights from a Danish research program are reported on. This program identifies five different actions for dealing with corruption: (1) no action; (2) withdrawals from markets; (3) decentralized decision-making process; (4) establishment of an anti-corruption code; and (5) mutual commitment through <b>integrity</b> <b>pact.</b> The following aspects of ethical behavior should be regulated through an anti-corruption code: the company vis-à-vis political parties; gifts and entertainment expenses; political campaign contributions; and policy against small-scale corruption. Directions for future research are considered including the role of international organizations and multinational companies in fighting corruption and fostering ethical behavior; the role of countries and their governments; and the management systems...|$|E
40|$|In most {{general terms}} this article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the trust in the local government area in terms of financial management and integrity. This is important because it relates to the implementation of the obligations and functions of local government to the people by adjusting its financial capacity. Financial capacity of local governments to determine the ability of local governments in carrying out its functions as a public service function, development function and protective function. The low fiscal capacity will lead to negative effects, i. e., low levels of public services and can lead to the decline on public trust in local government performance. In summary, unresponsive governance has been responsible for the continuing decline of trust in government. The challenge now is to make government more trustworthy through improvement of basic services and access, emphasizing equality and fairness in providing services, take the solution to reduce graft and corruption seriously, improve integrity in governance, innovative leadership, pressing a waste of public resources, improve institutional representation, and involve civil society. The final challenge is to increase the trust in the government to make a deal trust between government and citizen, i. e., the <b>integrity</b> <b>pact,</b> and citizen charters. Therefore, this article describes several areas include the following: (1) The political culture and democratization; (2) Reform efforts such as professionalism, commitment and innovation; (3) Trust and integrity in the publi...|$|E
40|$|This note {{examines}} the <b>Integrity</b> <b>Pact</b> (IP) methodology proposed by Transparency International {{to confront the}} problem of corruption in public procurement. The examination draws from a decision model for participants developed elsewhere, in which the critical elements are shown to be {{the vulnerability of the}} conditions under which the tender is conducted and the risk of bribing. The IP methodology intends to interfere with the central elements in individual tender instantiations by a process of discussion leading to mutual trust; participants and public officials sign a pledge of honesty. Disputes are to be resolved by private arbitration and allegedly enforcement is attained by force of a private contract between participants. Preferably, a civil society organization stimulates and monitors the process and acts as fiducial guarantor. Publicising proceedings stimulates discus-sion and enhances transparency. All this is held to favourably affect the process, leading to better results. This, in turn, is held to affect the overall environment over time. In order to accommodate for the ethical dimension introduced by IPs, the present analysis incorporates an “ethical” factor operating over the conditions under which tenders are conducted. Ascertaining the operation of this hypothetical factor is an empirical question. The examination of IP premises, together with evidence collected from instantiations of the meth-odology, plus the absence of comparative empirical data on bribery, leads to the conclusion that IPs do not heighten the risk of bribing for participants. Contrary to the methodology’s claim, en-forcement, be it from arbitration or otherwise, is shown to be dependent on each particular envi-ronment. Conditions under which particular tenders are conducted might be bettered, but not un-conditionally, as the institutional framework perforce dominates private agreements. The influence of the “ethical” factor cannot be assessed for lack of empirical evidence, and the honesty pledge IPs rely on is argued to be devoid of significance. Although for lack of data the economic effi-ciency of the methodology cannot be ascertained, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that IPs do not bet-ter the outcomes piecewise. The methodology fails to address the problem of cartelisation that af-fects public markets, and – perhaps due to the low frequency of its application – does not discuss measures to counterbalance the action of cartels. Interpreting the premises behind the IP idea, it is argued that they stem from a perspective on cor-ruption rooted on morality rather than on the mechanisms that propitiate bribery. Thus, tackling individual instantiations is favoured over confronting systemic factors. IP guidelines stipulate that the absence of allegations of bribery in a tender authorises the sponsor-ing NGO to announce that the tender was “clean”. It is argued that such manifestations of overcon-fidence are hazardous for the reputation of NGOs that adopt the methodology. It is also argued that the continuous involvement of NGOs with IPs raises questions about their entitlement to it, more-over because NGOs are not bound by oversight and accountability constraints that formally charac- terise State organisms. It is contended that for both governments and NGOs, promoting and par-ticipating in IPs is a strategic decision that should be balanced with their effectiveness towards the aim of changing the institutional environment.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim is to}} analyze the factors that affect the poor implementation of the code of engineer’s ethics at Polyclinic Construction dr. Soeroto Hospital of Kabupaten Ngawi. The reason {{of this research is}} due to the deviation of the higher trend in the construction field. This trend {{is a reflection of the}} increasing violation to the code of engineer’s ethics. The research is a descriptive one with qualitative method in order to describe systematically, factually, and accurately relationship among studied phenomena. Location of the research is selected purposively by considering that the project was one with highest value at that time and many digressions in its construction had been found and became popular in the Kabupaten Ngawi so that the digression case was proposed to Corruption Crime Court. Data is collected by using interview, observation, and documentation. Interview is performed with informants from the hospital, executive contractor, supervision consultant, and other tender participants. Observation is conducted in passive-participative manner. Documentation is performed by collecting data from report of examination results of Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan (BPK) of East Java Province, report of examination results of Inspektorat of Kabupaten Ngawi about construction of polyclinics room of dr. Soeroto General Hospital of Kabupaten Ngawi. Based on the results of this research, the analysis of four factors of the low implementation of the code of engineer’s ethics at polyclinic Construction et dr. Soeroto hospital of Kabupaten Ngawi are : commitment among key persons, human resources, public policy and the conflict interest among actors. Low commitment factor was seen in the executive contractor who handed over the work to other party without any clear documents. Problem of human resource factor was found in the project owner in which low quantity and inappropriate of technical employees were found. Problem of policy factor emerged because there was no clear rule regulating about ethical code of engineer profession in Kabupaten Ngawi so that there was no protection for project owner and no sanction threat against executive contractor who violates ethical code of engineer profession in Kabupaten Ngawi. Furthermore, conflict of interest emerged between project owner and supervision consultant. There was power backing the executive contractor so that the project owner was less resolutely supervising works of the executive contractor because the project owner was subordinate of the power, whereas the supervision consultant tended to allow the executive contractor with reason of his company existence. Based on analysis performed in the research, the four factors affecting low implementation of ethical code of engineer profession in construction of polyclinic room of dr. Soeroto General Hospital of Kabupaten Ngawi were proved, namely: commitment factor, human resource factor, policy factor and conflict of interest. Whereas, recommendation for local government of Kabupaten Ngawi in attempts of reinforcing ethical code of engineer profession is law enforcement against any digression in commitment between actors or in policy that is taken. The technical professionalism of human resources skills shouid improve. This improvement can be done through the proccess of auction. It should be implemented from the performance to maintenance of the work. Commitment strengthening of every actor such as: signing of <b>integrity</b> <b>pact</b> by engineers. Finally, implementation of ethical code of engineer profession is expected to protect the service user, especially local government of Kabupaten Ngawi...|$|E
