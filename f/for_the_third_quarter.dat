However, work on the ship was suspended in June that year, and Kentuckys bottom structure was launched {{to make room for}} LST construction on 10 June. While her {{construction was}} suspended, the Bureau of Ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for Kentucky and Illinois {{in the aftermath of the}} Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. As proposed, the converted Kentucky would have had an [...] long by [...] wide flight deck, with armament identical to the carriers of the : four twin 5-inch gun mounts and four more 5-inch guns in single mounts, along with six 40mm quadruple mounts. The idea was abandoned after the Bureau of Ships decided that the converted ships would carry fewer aircraft than the Essex class, that more Essex-class carriers could be built in the same amount of time, and that the conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new Essexes. Instead, Kentucky and Illinois were to be completed as battleships, but their construction was given very low priority. Work on the ship resumed on 6December 1944, when the keel structure was returned to the slipway. Work on the battleship proceeded at a slow pace, and her completion was projected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter</b> of 1946.
