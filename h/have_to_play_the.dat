[...] Ian Martin from Allmusic also commended Jam and Lewis' collaboration, saying that [...] "providing {{stark contrast to the}} cheap, tinny sound that characterized much Japanese pop of the previous decade, with [...] "Wait & See" [...] and [...] "Addicted to You" [...] both featuring the production talents of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis." [...] Miko Amaranthine from Yahoo!

2500|$|In his 1949 book, Hindu Rashtra Darshan, Savakar wrote [...] "Nazism proved undeniably {{the savior}} of Germany". Savarkar often {{compared}} Germany's German majority and Jewish minority as analogous to India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority, though Savarkar never mentions the persecution of Jews in Germany. Gandhi himself praised the Nazis {{until the end of}} the War, when the Genocide came to light to the world, and condemnation followed. Savarkar never said that he was a proponent of murder and genocide against minorities, and instead desired peaceful assimilation. Savarkar condemned both German Jews and the Indian Muslims for their supposed inability to assimilate. In 1938, he wrote, [...] "if we Hindus in India grow stronger in time, these Moslem friends of the league type will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> part of German Jews." [...] He further added that India [...] "must be a Hindu land, reserved for Hindus".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Cruyff became {{synonymous with}} the playing style of [...] "Total Football". It is a system where a player who moves out of his {{position}} is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field [...] "conductor". Space {{and the creation of}} it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: [...] "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We always talked about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the riots, the {{government}} announced its willingness to harshen the current football stadia act, also known as Pisanu decree (Italian: Decreto Pisanu) after former Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Pisanu, who enacted the law in 2005. In its original form, the Pisanu decree required Italian mayors and football clubs to meet specific safety standards in their stadiums; however, these have been ignored by most of Serie A and B clubs, meaning {{that the majority of}} Italian football venues, including Catania, did not comply with these standards. Former Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato officially permitted departures from these standards for the 2006/2007 football season. The events in Catania, however, led Minister Amato, and Minister of Sports Giovanna Melandri, to immediately cancel every derogation, thus forcing teams to play [...] "behind closed doors" [...] (forbidding the presence of spectators for every venue not within the law), including Stadio San Siro in Milan, Stadio San Paolo in Naples and Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence. Catania were banned from playing in their stadium {{for the remainder of the}} season, and will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> remainder of their home fixtures at a neutral venue. The Catania club was successively punished by the Italian Football Federation with the obligation not to play its home matches in its home stadium, and additionally with no spectators (a porte chiuse). This was however partially overturned on April 4 by the TAR (Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale, regional administrative court) of Catania, which decided the Football Federation should allow spectators to take part on the team's home matches. The decision was overturned by the TAR of Rome some days later, but re-overturned by the Catania TAR in mid-April; this caused the delay of the league match Catania vs Ascoli, originally scheduled to be played on April 22 in Modena with no spectators' presence. The match was rescheduled on May 2. In the end, the FIGC allowed Catania supporters to attend the two final [...] "home" [...] matches against AC Milan and Chievo, both played at Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, Bologna.|$|E

No," [...] added the old man thoughtfully, [...] "I think that the friends of progress must abandon assassination as invariably useless.

He laughed about it, and said he never saw a man look more wicked and more bent on killing than you did: 'And to do Sir George justice, I think he has hated me ever since,' says the Chief. 'Ah!' he added, 'an open enemy I can face readily enough. 'Tis the secret foe who causes the doubt and anguish! We have sat with more than one at my table to-day, to whom I am obliged to show a face of civility, whose hands I must take when they are offered, though I know they are stabbing my reputation, and are eager to pull me down from my place.
