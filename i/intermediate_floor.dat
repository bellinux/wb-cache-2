The development was once again the subject of controversy when only one sale had been completed within the commonly accepted three-month completion period; and all but four transactions, including the record-setting sale, were later cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the {{re-entrant}} angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted chambers are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the lighthouse}} base {{is made of}} bolted cast iron segments, [...] in diameter and [...] high. The tower is [...] from the base to the lantern, conical in shape, with four <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> levels. It is built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanised wrought iron plates, painted white. On {{top of the tower}} is a Chance Brothers [...] diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon. The dome of the lantern is painted red.|$|E
50|$|In {{a single}} {{occupancy}} domestic dwelling it is usual to provide two-way switching. The lights may {{be turned on}} or off from either the top, bottom or <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> of the staircase. They remain on until turned off manually.|$|R
40|$|Escape {{routes in}} {{high-rise}} residential buildings {{are an important}} element for emergency escape. Escape stairs are normally designed with <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floors</b> to connect two staircases between the floor levels in high-rise buildings. This paper discusses {{an analysis of the}} effect of this <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floor</b> on the total evacuation time during evacuation in emergency situation e. g. fire emergency Analysis was done by comparing two different staircases width i. e. 914 mm designed with and without <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floors</b> and 1524 mm designed with and without <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floors</b> as well. Evacuation simulation software i. e. SIMULEX was used to simulate a number of people evacuating the predesigned floor models with the different staircase specifications. Total evacuation time recorded from those simulation processes are then compared with the time different taken by the same number of people evacuating the models. It is found that there was an effect on the total evacuation time for the staircase designed with and without <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floors.</b> The simulation suggested that people will take 15 % to 24 % longer to evacuate the building if staircase was designed with <b>intermediate</b> landing <b>floors...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1893, the {{building}} was restored as far as was possible to its original condition. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> were removed and the pointed-arched windows restored to the great hall on the upper floor. Today the hall can be rented for social events.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the meaning}} of numbers in Chinese culture, [...] "auspicious" [...] {{numbering}} system was adopted by the developers, where the top floor was [...] "88" [...] – Chinese for double fortune. It is already common in Hong Kong for ~4th floors not to exist; there is no requirement by the Buildings Department for numbering other than that it being [...] "made in a logical order." [...] A total of 42 <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> numbers are omitted from 39 Conduit Road: those missing include 14, 24, 34, 64, all floors between 40 and 59; the floor number which follows 68 is 88. The Democratic Party accused the developer of misleading the public; Albert Ho, its chairman, said [...] "..This is a classic incident to show how powerful big developers are in Hong Kong." [...] The Consumer Council recognised the accepted common practice of skipping the 13th and 14th floors, but suggested that developers [...] "imaginary heights brought back to earth." [...] Henderson said that the floor numbers omitted are in line with information in sales brochures and were not inconsistent with the approved building plans and the occupation permit. Its chairman, Lee Shau-kee, said [...] "buyers like those numbers and we aren't cheating them." ...|$|E
60|$|A few muskets were discharged, {{both from}} below and above, at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor,</b> but the {{thickness}} of the planks prevented the bullets from doing injury. Then commenced a struggle in which the respective qualities of the combatants were exhibited in a singularly characteristic manner. While the Indians improved their advantages beneath, with all the arts known to savage warfare, the young men resisted with that wonderful aptitude of expedient, and readiness of execution, which distinguish the American borderer.|$|E

50|$|Around 1590 the {{building}} had increasingly declined into a large barn, with grain storage and wine pressing. In the same period, it acquired embrasures. In 1758, the interior was once more completely changed; newly constructed <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> {{made it possible to}} store even more grains.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{ordinary}} open or covered {{goods wagons}} {{were used for}} the transportation of cattle and other large animals, special livestock wagons were being developed for small livestock as early as the 19th century. Optimal use of the roughly 2 metre high loading volume was made by loading domestic pigs, goats and sheep on two levels. Some wagons could have <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> fitted for transporting poultry.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} brick masonry, and has 110 steps inside with no <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors.</b> Originally {{the light was}} {{equipped}} with a Fresnel lens system, and it displayed a white light towards a sector clockwise from south to northeast. There were two lighthouse keepers and a master until 1962 when the lighthouse was automated. A pilot station was built next to the tower, currently the pilot station serves as a hotel.|$|R
50|$|Supertall skyscrapers {{can often}} {{have one or}} more of what is known as a sky lobby, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> where people can change from an express {{elevator}} that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator which stops at every floor within a segment of the building.|$|E

50|$|Mancetter Manor House is a timber-framed {{building}} {{dating from}} about 1330. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> was {{inserted in the}} great hall in about 1480 and the south wing was added in about 1580. The central chinmeystack was probably inserted in the 17th century and small extensions to the house {{were made in the}} 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5000|$|With the tilt-up method, {{concrete}} elements (walls, columns, structural supports, etc.) {{are formed}} horizontally on a concrete slab; this normally requires the building floor as a building form {{but may be}} a temporary concrete casting surface near the building footprint. After the concrete has cured, the elements are [...] "tilted" [...] to the vertical position with a crane and braced into position until the remaining building structural components (roofs, <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> and walls) are secured.|$|R
5|$|The rooms {{above the}} {{clockwork}} mechanism {{were used by}} the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance {{and in the course}} of regular guided tours.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th {{century the}} last major changes took place. The cinema was removed and the entire {{interior}} reworked. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> of the station building were opened to the public and the whole area turned into a shopping mall. Ticket purchase and information was moved to the historic Jugendstil lounge. Three wall mosaics were made by the artist, Iris Rauh. The mosaic Zeitreise ("time journey"), which portrays the subject of travel during the course of time, became nationally noted. On 24 June 2002 the opening ceremony of the station building, now placed under historical building protection, took place.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mezzanine}} (or in French, an entresol) is, strictly speaking, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> in {{a building}} which is partly open to the double-height ceilinged floor below, or which does not extend over the whole floorspace of the building. However, the term is often used loosely for the floor above the ground floor, especially where a very high original ground floor has been split horizontally into two floors.|$|E
50|$|The top {{floors of}} the {{building}} were used as a working space for deconstruction, and these are gradually jacked down and lowered as each <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> is removed. As of February 2013 the building had shrunk by 30 metres. Regenerative braking is used on the cranes being used to lower disassembled elements down to ground level, which recovers energy and generates electricity for powering aspects of the demolition operation.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the walls}} are vistages of the Alcazaba that include stairs {{that lead to the}} battlements that {{encircle}} the walls and tower landings. Some of the windows, with different cutouts, that suggest the existence of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor.</b> In the largest tower is a domed vault with rectangular window, in front of which is a polygonal cistern with covered cross vault. At the beginning of the battlements are vestiges of primitive constructions.|$|E
50|$|The sizing and {{placement}} of window and door openings satisfied {{the expectation of}} standardisation and simplification that had become an orthodoxy during the war years, and was also well suited to systemised building. Internal linings are very robust, consisting of a 2 in leaf of clinkerblock work, plastered on the inner face, whilst <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> are of concrete on metal lath reinforcement. As a result, the houses {{give the impression of}} being extremely solidly built. The steel frame was designed to accept a number of different claddings, from conventional brickwork to render on a metal lath.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of rectangular plates subjected to both intermediate and end uniaxial loads. The rectangular plates have two simply supported opposite edges that are perpendicular to the in-plane load direction, while the other two plate edges can have free, simply supported, or clamped edges. The solution procedure involves the use of the Levy approach, the domain decomposition technique, and the state-space concept. The method furnishes exact stability criteria; samples of which are presented in a graphical form for plates with various boundary conditions. These results will be useful to engineers who design plates (or walls) that support <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{establish}} optimum building aspect ratios and south window sizes of residential buildings from thermal performance point of view. The effects of 6 different building aspect ratios and eight different south window sizes for each building aspect ratio are analyzed for apartments located at <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> of buildings, by the aid of the computer based thermal analysis program SUNCODE-PC in five cities of Turkey: Erzurum, Ankara, Diyarbakir, Izmir, and Antalya. The results are evaluated in terms of annual energy consumption and the optimum values are driven. Comparison of optimum values and the total energy consumption rates is made among the analyzed cities...|$|R
50|$|The largest part of {{the station}} lies below Lindwurmstraße and only the {{northern}} end is beneath Goetheplatz. At both ends an <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> {{can be reached by}} escalators and stairs. Goetheplatz can be reached by a variety of exits including escalators and an elevator. However, at the southern end only two relatively small staircases lead to both sides of Lindwurmstraße. On both intermediate floors, small kiosks can be found, with a bakery store on the northern side.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the lighthouse}} base {{is made of}} bolted cast iron segments, 13 m in diameter and 4.6 m high. The tower is 18 m from the base to the lantern, conical in shape, with four <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> levels. It is built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanised wrought iron plates, painted white. On {{top of the tower}} is a Chance Brothers 10 ft diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon.

5000|$|Due to {{selective}} numbering, a {{total of}} 42 <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> numbers are missing from 39 Conduit Road: these include 14, 24, 34, 64, all floors between 40 and 59. The floor above the 68th is the 88th. The Democratic Party accused the developer of misleading; the Consumer Council recognised the accepted common practice of skipping the 13th and 14th floors, but suggested that developers [...] "imaginary heights brought back to earth." [...] Lee Shau Kee argued that buyers liked the numbering scheme.|$|E
50|$|The three-storey {{block of}} glass is {{vertically}} furrowed {{by a series}} of ceramic strips or ‘fins’ glazed in blue and green. The bottom third of the extension is transparent, the middle third layered and semi-transparent, and the top is a solid ceramic box. The three new floors double the museum’s exhibition and public space. On the ground floor the cafe provides a 180-degree view of the surrounding Sydney Gardens. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> in the extension provide a ‘cabinet of curiosities’ display of previously stored items from the Holburne’s collection. The day-lit top floor provides a temporary gallery. A secondary staircase, lift and service spaces form connection between old and new. A basement extension now provides storage and education space.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} a bank made of four different <b>floors.</b> The <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> (CVA and Treasury) {{are in charge}} of filtering out counterparty risk and its risky funding implications from the contracts with the clients of the bank. In the case of the Treasury there are two desks on the same floor (sharing the same bank account): the FVA desk, in charge of funding the VM, and the MVA desk, in charge of funding the IM. The upper floor is the management in charge of the KVA payments to the shareholders, i.e. of the dividend distribution policy of the bank. Thanks to the upper floors of the bank, the traders of the bottom (dubbed clean) floor can focus on the management of the market risk of their respective business lines, ignoring counterparty risk and its capital and funding implications.|$|R
50|$|Meraas Tower was a supertall {{skyscraper}} 600 m (1,968 ft) tall, {{which was}} proposed to be constructed in Jumeirah Garden City, Dubai. When completed {{it would have}} been one of the tallest skyscrapers in Dubai. The tower design had a series of faceted surfaces that would help light and air travel throughout the building. The faceted shapes were projected to maximize energy generation, balance natural light, and offer 360-degree views of the city below. They also would create natural atrium spaces as the building ascended, allowing the creation of naturally lit sky gardens. Exposing the <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> would have made it seem as if the structure was composed of four smaller towers stacked one on top of another. Tower was to include 300,000 square meters of hotel, convention, commercial and retail spaces. However, in 2009, The project was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|The second owner, who {{ultimately}} {{lived on the}} property, bought it in 1847 and held it for forty-seven years until 1894. Most of the phase 2 and subsequent construction probably occurred during this period. During this timeframe, balloon framing was a popular and inexpensive technique for many farm houses in the 19th century. Requiring no specialized skills, it utilized long continuous framing members (studs) that ran from sill plate to eave line with <b>intermediate</b> <b>floor</b> structures nailed to them, with the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height marked out on the studs.|$|E
50|$|In West Street, Swan House and School View are {{two parts}} of a single building.

50|$|The first {{renovation}} {{took place}} in 1929, during the great depression. The building area was multiplied by adding three extra storeys {{on top of the}} two 3. It was a typical design move during that period, as constructing a new building was too expensive. The three storeys were designed according to the first two, except for the small setback on the fifth floor façade. It was also built in the same materials as the previous two storeys. The interior was fully renovated; a light well was put through the centre of the building, enabling skylight to puncture through to the main floor. The ornamental details were designed in the Renaissance Revival style, using plasters as the main material. The 1970 minor renovation saw the light well closed and the addition of two <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors</b> {{between the first and second}} floor, and between the third and fourth floor.|$|R

500|$|A {{standard}} gauge railway tunnel, codenamed Ida, {{was to be}} built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo. Hugo connected in turn with Sophie, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida. Each of the main tunnels {{had a number of}} unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to [...] long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been [...] in diameter and up to [...] high. A number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>floors,</b> possibly as many as ten, would have been built up the sides of the chamber.|$|R
