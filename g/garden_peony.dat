40|$|Abstract. Understanding the chronological {{change in}} soil {{microbial}} community structure of tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden</b> ecosystem is important from ecological, environmental, and management perspectives. Soil {{samples were collected}} from three tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden</b> systems (5 -, 12 -, and 25 -year-old tree <b>peony</b> <b>gardens),</b> and adjacent wasteland at Luoyang, Henan Province of China. Soil microbial community structure was analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method. The bacterial and actinomycete PLFAs increased from the wasteland to 5 -year-old tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden</b> and then decreased from the 5 -to 25 -year-old tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden,</b> and the fungal PLFA first increased and then decreased with the increasing planting years, with the greatest amount found in the 12 -year-old tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden.</b> The conversion from the wasteland to tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden</b> resulted in {{a significant increase in}} Shannon index, Richness, and Evenness. However, with the succeeding development of tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden</b> ecosystems, Shannon index, Richness, and Evenness decreased from the 5 - to 25 -year-old tree <b>peony</b> <b>garden...</b>|$|R
