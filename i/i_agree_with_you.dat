500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that, however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeonâ€™s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Another favourite. It's hard to explain the special appeal of this episode. Perhaps it's because Homer is so exceptionally dumb. Or perhaps because it contains the 'D'oh!' 'A deer!' 'A female deer!' gag." [...] This gag was also praised by BBC News's Mark Milne, who said: [...] " [...] just cracks me up every time. Brilliant!" [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the fifth season included [...] "plenty of programs with potentially cheesy concepts", such as [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] and [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant". However, he thought the episode managed to [...] "easily overcome its possible flaws" [...] {{to turn into a}} [...] "very fine program". Homer's line [...] "Marge, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in theory. In theory, communism works [...] In theory" [...] was Jacobson's favorite of the episode. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5.|$|E
