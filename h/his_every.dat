Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks <b>his</b> <b>every</b> entrance.

5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate <b>his</b> <b>every</b> whim.|$|E
5|$|The Pope {{commissioned}} French abbot Bernard of Clairvaux {{to preach}} the Second Crusade, and granted the same indulgences for it which Pope Urban II had accorded to the First Crusade. A parliament was convoked at Vezelay in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on March 31. Louis VII of France, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the princes and lords present prostrated {{themselves at the}} feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at <b>his</b> <b>every</b> step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, Conrad III of Germany and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, received the cross from the hand of Bernard. Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be rid of the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of the}} equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize <b>his</b> <b>every</b> action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now <b>his</b> <b>every</b> action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. <b>His</b> <b>every</b> appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E

The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping <b>his</b> <b>every</b> move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|The {{case against}} Thomas Cromwell was weak - {{it was well}} known that Cromwell favoured {{religious}} reform, though he had not proceeded any further with his program of reforms than the king would allow, and <b>his</b> <b>every</b> act had been authorised by the king.

Smith has been a regular feature, but in a much deeper role acting as a central defensive midfielder.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione Granger creates fake, enchanted Galleons {{that are}} used for {{communication}} between members of Dumbledore's Army.

Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with <b>his</b> <b>every</b> waking breath.
