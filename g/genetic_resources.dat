5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources,</b> the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Bulgarian {{government}} {{approved the}} National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programme seeking {{the preservation of}} local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> Bulgaria {{has some of the}} largest Natura 2000 areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve agricultural <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E

5|$|Population {{numbers for}} the Castillonnais are quite low. The {{majority}} of breeders are located in Castillon-en-Couserans, in Ariège, but a few {{can be found in}} Brittany and Provence. In November 2005, there were only around 260 existing Castillonnais, and a goal was created by the breed association to double the number of purebred mares between 2005 and 2014. Inbreeding is a concern due to low population numbers, and the national stud farm at Tarbes and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agronomic Research) have been brought in to help safeguard the <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> of the breed.|$|E

40|$|Two {{sources of}} bias arise in {{conventional}} loss predictions {{in the wake}} of natural disasters. One source of bias stems from neglect of accounting for animal <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> loss. A second source of bias stems from failure to identify, in addition to the direct effects of such loss, the indirect effects arising from implications impacting animal-human interactions. We argue that, in some contexts, the magnitude of bias imputed by neglecting animal <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> stocks is substantial. We show, in addition, and contrary to popular belief, that the biases attributable to losses in distinct <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> stocks are very likely to be the same. We derive the formal equivalence across the distinct resource stocks by deriving an envelope result in a model that forms the mainstay of enquiry in subsistence farming and we validate the theory, empirically, in a World-Society-for-the-Protection-of-Animals applicatio...|$|R

25|$|Even {{though this}} is a field with many uncertainties, it is {{expected}} that over the next 50 years climate changes will {{have an effect on the}} diversity of forest <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases, creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations. To inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of forest reproductive material, may be needed.|$|E

25|$|The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) of the FAO listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011. In 2000 {{the number}} of breeds of donkey {{recorded}} worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> project. The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries. In France, for example, only one breed, the Baudet de Poitou, was recognised prior to the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.|$|E
