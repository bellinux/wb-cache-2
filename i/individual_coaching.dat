500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Taylor was {{considered}} a better hockey player than cricketer. When she began playing for Thames Valley, she {{was considered a}} wicket-keeper {{with no more than}} average batting ability. At university, she began to develop her batting, playing alongside the men for her college side. The different pace and strength required in the men's game meant that she had to learn to play off the back foot, in contrast to women's cricket, which is generally played off the front foot. After graduating from university in 1997, she made her international debut for England in 1998, but batted low in the order for England, having been picked as a wicket-keeper. Intent on improving her batting, she began one-on-one coaching with Mark Lane. At the time, it was unusual for a member of the England women's team to have <b>individual</b> <b>coaching</b> sessions, and Taylor had to pay for the meetings herself. When they began working together, Lane was critical of her batting; [...] "She was just average, I would say." [...] The sessions helped to improve Taylor's mental approach towards batting as well as making technical changes, though Lane promoted the use of bottom-handed hockey-style shots which came more naturally to Taylor. At her peak, she used her intelligence to help manipulate the field; in an interview she described that, [...] "when I'm batting at my best I have a 3D awareness of the shape of the field and where the spaces are." ...|$|E
500|$|Washington {{was drafted}} fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A {{week before the}} team began {{training}} camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony. He {{had a difficult time}} making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed {{in high school and college}} due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA. He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be [...] "labeled soft." [...] The injury would bother him the rest of his career. He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding <b>individual</b> <b>coaching</b> in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.|$|E
