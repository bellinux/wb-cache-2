FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) {{is a new}} method to analyze potential reliability problems in the development cycle of the project, {{making it easier to}} take actions to overcome such issues, thus enhancing the reliability through design or process. Anticipating these failure modes, being the central step in the analysis, needs to be carried on extensively, in order to prepare a list of maximum potential failure modes. Risk is measured in terms of Risk Priority Number (RPN) that is a product of occurrence, severity, and detection difficulty. This study attempted to improve clod mean weight diameter and soil inversion as indicators of tillage quality by FMEA methodology. The results showed that low soil moisture, slow speed of ploughing and great <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> is the most important factors that increase clod MWD with 900, 630 and 560 RPN, respectively. Also for soil inversion the slow speed of ploughing, not using coulter, low soil moisture and great <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> are important factors with 720, 648, 490 and 420 RPN. Using a split - split factorial experiment with 16 treatments and three replications also acknowledged the results of this method. After reforming the conditions and re-testing the experiment, results showed that clod MWD was reduced 20 % and soil inversion increased 2 % approximately.

40|$|Tillage is a soil's {{machining}} process {{in order to}} make its structure suitable for plant growing. The efficiency of the tillage is measured by the power consumption or the tillage force.

40|$|The minimum {{possible}} soil tillage is {{an important}} part of a sustainable crop production system. Research and practice of reduced tillage was originally started mainly to reduce energy and time consumption related to tillage. However, current research and practice of reduced tillage is also aimed at soil and water conservation as well as reduction of nutrient losses from arable land. Research on reduced tillage in Sweden has been conducted for more than two decades. Reduced tillage comprises different tillage systems, which replace the traditional moldboard ploughing. These also include modem plough shares by which <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> can be reduced to about 10 cm. This report summarizes investigations of soil physical properties in six long-term experiments with reduced tillage. The experiments were 6 to 24 years old at the time of investigation (in 1997 or 1998). In this study, soil physical properties after minimum tillage and conventional ploughing were compared. Soil physical properties investigated include dry bulk density, soil water content during the vegetation period, infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity, air permeability in the field and laboratory, oxygen content of soil air after continuous or heavy rain, and soil temperature. Soil water content during the vegetation period was measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The dry bulk density in the lower part of the top soil was greater in plots with reduced tillage than in plots with conventional ploughing. Many of the investigated soil physical properties were improved by reduced tillage. Variation of soil water content was smaller for reduced tillage than for conventional ploughing. This shows that drainage and water holding capacity often were improved, particularly in the heavy soils. crop yield in heavy clays has been improved by reduced tillage. In some cases, A decrease in yield was observed during the initial periods of reduced tillage, but the difference has been minimized with time, which can be attributed to the improvement of soil structure. This improvement, however, may be less pronounced in light soils. A well planned transition from conventional ploughing to reduced tillage, such as loosening of old plough pan and minimizing of infestation by perennial weeds, can minimize yield losses...|$|E

A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects <b>of</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing.</b> The field studies were located 12 km South of Évora, Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side length of 15 mm as ‘tracers’. Offset angles for the harrow disk were 20 ◦, 44 ◦ and 59 ◦; tractor velocities ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 0 km h− 1 and tillage depth ranged from 4 to 11 cm. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3. 7 km h− 1. The translocation coefficients for the two implements were very different averaging 770 kgm− 1 for the mouldboard plough and ranging from 9 to 333 kgm− 1 for the harrow disk. This shows that the mouldboard plough was more erosive than the harrow disk in these studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient for the harrow disk. Displacement distances were the largest for compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles, and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the opening angle. Our results can be used to predict the transport coefficient (a potential soil quality indicator for tillage erosion) for the harrow disk, provided tillage depth, opening angle, and tool operating speed are known...|$|R

The development of the seedling stand was also followed in order to determine its shading effect on the soil surface.

The maximum temperatures on sunny days were lower in the tilts <b>of</b> the <b>ploughed</b> and in the humps <b>of</b> the cross-directional <b>ploughed</b> sites compared with the unprepared area. Correspondingly, the night temperatures were higher and so the soil preparation considerably reduced the risk of night frost.

The maximum increase in monthly mean temperatures was almost 5 °C, and the daily variation in the surface parts of the tilts and humps increased so that excessively high temperatures for the optimal growth of the root system were measured from time to time. The temperature also rose at the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> 50 and 100 cm. Soil preparation also increased the cumulative temperature sum.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat. The 3 -cut system resulted in nitrate losses below the limit of the EC Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC), even with ploughing in autumn. When ploughed in spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> time. With swards mulched and ploughed in autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit. The management of grass-clover swards did not affect the yield <b>of</b> wheat, whereas <b>ploughing</b> in autumn increased the yield. It is concluded, that appropriate grass-clover management and date <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> can reduce N-leaching, even in stockless farms...|$|R
50|$|This event, as popularized in England, had {{teams of}} horses or {{bullocks}} competing and were judged on the straightness and uniformity <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the furrow {{and the way}} the earth was turned over, and of course the time for the team to complete its allocated area. Prizes were allocated according to divisions which reflected the class <b>of</b> <b>ploughing</b> team. Difficulties in organising such events included finding sufficient area of uniform consistency to give ensure fair competition and having had sufficient rain that the ground was not impossibly hard and yet not boggy. The first such organised in South Australia was by the South Australian Agricultural Society in September 1843 and attracted considerable public interest and was emulated by many of the regional agricultural societies.|$|R
