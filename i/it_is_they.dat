5|$|In 1998, modern Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{asks his}} {{colleague}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{for help with}} a case the Group have not authorized; he remains cryptic as to what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>They</b> travel to Germany to investigate {{the murder of a}} Dr. Schlossburg, whose lab is found to house a mummified body. The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb.|$|E
5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves and do whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, {{as well as the}} division of days into twelve parts, came from the Babylonians. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>they,</b> according to Herodotus' Histories (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the Suda seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or with blindfold masking their eyes experiencing a large object by feeling it.

In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts of 1st millennium CE or before. The story also appears in 2nd millennium Sufi and Bahá’í lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet John Godfrey Saxe creating his own version as a poem. The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted {{in a variety of}} ways.|$|E

25|$|The Germani tribes which Caesar {{had earlier}} named {{in this region}} were the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Paemani (or Caemani), the Caeroesi, and the Segni. The biggest and most {{important}} tribe were the Eburones, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> who appear to have dominated {{all or most of}} modern-day Belgian and Dutch Limburg, with a territory probably covering all or most of the flat Campine (Dutch Kempen) northern part of this region, and stretching into neighbouring regions of the Netherlands, Wallonia and Germany. The other tribes are thought to have lived further south, in what is today Wallonia, or else just over the border in Germany - the Condrusi in the modern Condroz, near the Segni, and the Caeroesi in the Eifel forest region of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} {{theories}} {{for the arrival}} of Hinduism in Indonesia include that South Indian sea traders brought Hinduism with them, and second being that Indonesian royalty welcomed Indian religions and culture, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> who first adopted these spiritual ideas followed by the masses. Indonesian islands adopted both Hindu and Buddhist ideas, fusing them with pre-existing native folk religion and Animist beliefs. In the 4th century, the kingdom of Kutai in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java, and Holing (Kalingga) in Central Java, were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Excavations between 1950 and 2005, particularly at the Cibuaya and Batujaya sites, suggests that Tarumanagara revered deity Wisnu (Vishnu) of Hinduism. Ancient Hindu kingdoms of Java built many square temples, named rivers on the island as Gomati and Ganges, and completed major irrigation and infrastructure projects.|$|E

500|$|Hill was not {{the only}} one to attack the work; Thornton wrote satires of Amelia in the Drury-Lane Journal. Thornton's satires were first {{published}} on 16 January 1752 and included a fake advertisement for a parody novel called [...] "Shamelia", playing off of title of Fielding's parody Shamela. He later parodied Amelia again on 13 February 1752 in a piece called [...] "A New Chapter in Amelia." [...] Tobias Smollett joined in and published the pamphlet Habbakkuk Hilding anonymously on 15 January 1752. Although there were many attacks against Fielding's novel, there was some support for the work, and an anonymous pamphlet was written to attack [...] "Hill and 'the Town'" [...] while praising Amelia. On 25 January 1752, Fielding defended his work again by bringing the novel before the imaginary [...] "Court of Censorial Enquiry", in which Hill and the other critics are the prosecutors and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they,</b> not Amelia, that are truly put on trial.|$|E

500|$|Like Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, {{the story}} of The Flopsy Bunnies is about rabbits intruding upon the human domain and {{bringing}} the threat {{of death and destruction}} upon themselves by their own imprudence. M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh indicates in Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that the tale's principal theme is the trickster animal, though she is careful to point out that, even then, the animals are subordinate to the exquisite garden backgrounds. The reader's interest in the tale, she believes, lies in following the joke played upon McGregor rather than in the dull personalities of the rabbits. Although the trickster qualities of the rabbits are evident but muted in the earlier Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, in Flopsy Bunnies these qualities are brought to center stage. Kutzer notes that The Flopsy Bunnies belongs not to the title characters but to their parents [...] <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> who save the baby bunnies [...] and thus the story is often of less interest to children.|$|E

The director's cut version also includes an acoustic rendition of John Denver's [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane". Murphy {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: [...] "I think the key to <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience."

500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World.

The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together.
