5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> critical moments.|$|E

5|$|DeGeneres began {{negotiating}} with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} negotiations got out, DeGeneres found <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> the center of intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|Note: Björk's {{recordings}} {{have received}} two additional nominations, {{both of which}} were credited to the respective art directors and not to <b>herself.</b> <b>At</b> the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Mathias Augustyniak and Michael Amzalag were nominated in the Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package category for her boxset Family Tree. Similarly, at the 2013 ceremony, Augustyniak and Amzalag won in the Best Recording Package category for Biophilia.|$|E
5|$|Hilson {{originally}} premiered {{the song}} at her producer/mentor Polow da Don's launch party for his record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007, and later performed {{it several times}} as promoting it as In A Perfect Worlds sixth single. The song was not adequately receptive in the United States, reaching forty-nine on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Two music videos for the song were shot, the Chris Robinson-directed second version being used as the official video. The video features Hilson at getting ready and enjoying <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> a party, featuring appearances by Monica, Chris Brown, former Pussycat Dolls member Melody Thornton and Omarion, among others. She performed the song {{as a part of}} a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E

5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers.|$|E
5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E
5|$|She {{started the}} clay {{season at the}} International tournament Prague Open, where she lost to 98th-ranked Zhang Shuai, but renewed <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> the Madrid Open, where she reached her 35th final. Kuznetsova had wins over Ekaterina Makarova, Garbiñe Muguruza, Sam Stosur and Lucie Šafářová, and then {{defeated}} Maria Sharapova in two sets. She lost to Petra Kvitová in the final in straight sets. Kuznetsova reached the 2nd round of Roland Garros, losing there to long-time rival Francesca Schiavone in three tricky sets, 6–7(9–11), 7–5, 10–8. It was the third-longest women's match {{in the history of}} the French Open, lasting 3 hours and 50 minutes. This loss resulted to her exit from the top 20, losing ten ranking positions.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant {{is as good as}} any other. The shy Pipette throws <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|Gilly meets Leila Roy (Lena Kaur) and {{the pair}} begin a relationship. The romance is short as Leila tells Gilly they cannot be together. Gilly is {{upset by the}} breakup.

A drunken Hannah then throws <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> Gilly and tries to kiss him. Gilly tells her he sees her as a sister. She then apologises. In Hollyoaks: The Morning After the Night Before, Gilly goes to Manchester to party with Josh. Josh and Gilly begin a fight which ends with Gilly losing his front teeth. After {{returning}} to the village, Gilly begins to develop feelings for Steph and is jealous towards her relationship with Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> odds with her father and the police.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because {{there was no one to}} obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with several scenes interspersing, {{starting}} with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, {{as well as}} Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini. As the song's introduction plays, scenes of the Hawaii beaches are shown, as well as close-up glimpses of T.I. Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing to the camera and enjoying <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, {{as well as more}} scenes of Hawaiian landscape. By the second verse, Carey, now in a black bikini, is shown {{at the bottom of a}} ravine by the beach staring at the sun, then altering to scenes of the party once more. As T.I.'s verse starts, he's shown behind a waterfall, in the midst of shrubbery outside, where Mariah then appears sitting in a large body of clear water with golden sand. She then lies in the water, as the scene then switches to her underwater with the dolphin again.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill <b>herself.</b> <b>At</b> this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
