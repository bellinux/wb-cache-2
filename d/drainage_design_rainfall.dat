The existing data of <b>rainfall</b> temporal pattern <b>design</b> is not reliable because the climate change and the data of rainfall temporal pattern not renew since 2010. The rainfall temporal pattern is only divided by region in Malaysian Urban Storm Water Management Manual Second Edition (MSMA 2). This study provide rainfall distribution for the specific station area compared to the regional pattern provided in the MSMA 2. The rainfall temporal pattern were developed using Average Variability Method (AVM) which is sorted by rank 10 highest total rainfall data until the lowest one and Huff Time Distribution Method (HTDM) which is divided into four quartile. There are 10 number of station was selected. Data of every 5 minutes rainfall event for 16 years starting from 2000 to 2015 were gathered from Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) for purpose of this study. The temporal rainfall patterns developed are for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 180 minutes and 360 minutes duration. However, for HTDM only 60 minutes, 180 minutes and 360 minutes rainfall duration are were selected. It is because the data of event need to divide into four quartile.

All station shows the different in the range 1 %- 1800 % which is too high. It is because of specification area in developing the rainfall temporal pattern. The percentage of different increased since the duration of rainfall are increased.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} for urban <b>drainage</b> <b>design</b> (SODD) was proposed {{in this study}} to help analyze the tradeoff between investment and acceptable flood damage in urban <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> considering effects of both uncertainty and climate change. The simulation model (i. e.

The results from a case study showed that the deterministic optimization was computationally efficient with no randomness encountered in hydrological simulation, although its solution was hardly reliable in achieving the target for flood mitigation. The stochastic version, on the other hand, could offer richer information on system reliability and help managers make a more robust decision. The results also revealed that the rainfall extremes under the impact of climate change could significantly affect system investment.

30|$|Rainfall {{data are}} very {{important}} for climate study, water resources evaluation, <b>drainage</b> <b>design</b> (Desa and Rakhecha 2004; Wang 1987), environmental studies and many other purposes. As such, most of the countries try to avail as many rainfall and other climate monitoring stations as possible. Continuous collection and archiving of various types of climatic data including the rainfall are of enormous value to study the climate change effects {{on the environment and}} society. It is reported that rainfall of the last century is the highest over the past 8500  years (Hong et al. 2014). In a warming environment, the increasing trend of extreme rainfall events is seen, in terms of either rainfall quantity or event frequency (Goswami et al. 2006, Allan and Soden 2008). It is also evident that {{in some parts of the}} tropics, seasonality of rainfall is also changing (Kumar 2013). At least, the extreme rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia are reported to show increasing trend between the years 1975 and 2010 (Syafrina et al. 2015). As such, the need for analyzing the available rainfall data has become very much crucial for good planning for water resources development (Okonkwo and Mbajiorgu 2010). Quantification of rainfall is needed for proper planning and designing of various water resource projects (El-Sayed 2011). However, estimating short-duration rainfall intensities is a paramount need in many water-related projects such as urban <b>drainage</b> <b>design</b> (Haddad et al. 2011) and to mitigate the flash floods in the hilly areas. Doing over-design or under-design of hydraulic structures such as farm dams or culverts may yield a considerable waste of national resources or may compromise the safety of the structures (Reich 1961, 1963) and people living downstream of the hydraulic structures. According to Hamzah (2005), using at-site data to estimate <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> is the most common and reliable practice. However, he recommended regional estimation (Hosking and Wallis 2005) to calculate <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> which he described as more precise method of estimation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>rainfall</b> {{time series}} are a {{critical}} input for urban flood modeling and require depth-duration-frequency curves {{along with a}} design temporal pattern. The association between rainfall depth and duration, which depicts the inherent structure of rainfall patterns, {{plays an important role}} in flood-causing potential; this association can be revealed through a bivariate rainfall frequency analysis to obtain the depth-duration-frequency curves. Unlike earlier approaches that use either parametric or nonparametric models, the present study proposes a new semiparametric model approach, which can evaluate all possible combinations of the parametric-nonparametric marginals without restrictions. A comparison between the copula-based bivariate frequency analysis and the generalized least-squares regression shows the former to be better in performance.

3000|$|Data on intensity–duration–frequency or <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} information required for various hydrological and water resources studies. However, such crucial data are often unavailable in various parts of the world due to lack of enough rain gauging stations. It is not only tedious to determine <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> from the raw data but also occasionally impossible to calculate due to lack or absence of short-duration rainfall data. Generally, the manual rain gauges outnumber the automatic gauges, making it difficult to have adequate data on short-duration rainfall values, which is very important for urban hydrology. However, no graphical or mathematical relation could be found in the literature, which can be used for quick estimation of short-duration <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> from the daily rainfall data recorded by the manual stations. Annual maximum rainfall data from 143 rain gauging stations located at Klang Valley in Malaysia were used in this study. Statistical analyses and logarithmic graph fitting techniques were used to develop excellent correlation between short-duration rainfall and daily rainfall values for 96 automatic and 46 manual stations. Rainfall data analyze the <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> data of various duration and return periods. The 15, 30 and 45  min of short-duration rainfall, which is the most common rainfall duration in the study area, was observed to be 32.4 %, 47.1 % and 57.4 % of the daily rainfall amount, respectively. The amount of rainfall during 1 -, 2 - and 3 -h storm events contribute 64.9 %, 76.5 % and 80.9 % of the daily rainfall.

For engineering practitioners, stormwater infrastructure is designed using a peak flow method, {{such as the}} Rational Method as outlined in the Australian Rainfall and Runoff (AR&R) guidelines and estimates of <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> intensities. Changes to Australian <b>rainfall</b> intensity <b>design</b> criteria have been made through updated releases of the AR&R 77, AR&R 87 and the recent 2013 AR&R Intensity Frequency Distributions (IFDs). The primary focus {{of this study is}} to compare the three IFD sets from 51 locations Australia wide. Since the release of the AR&R 77 IFDs, the duration and number of locations for rainfall data has increased and techniques for data analysis have changed. Updated terminology coinciding with the 2013 IFD release has also resulted in a practical change to the <b>design</b> <b>rainfall.</b> For example, infrastructure that is designed for a 1 : 5 year ARI correlates with an 18. 13 % AEP, however for practical purposes, hydraulic guidelines have been updated with the more intuitive 20 % AEP. The evaluation of <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> variation across Australia has indicated that the changes are dependent upon location, recurrence interval and rainfall duration. The changes to <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> IFDs are due to the application of differing data analysis techniques, the length and number of data sets and the change in terminology from ARI to AEP. Such changes mean that developed infrastructure has been designed to a range of different design criteria indicating the likely inadequacy of earlier developments to the current estimates of flood risk.

Estimation of <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> is generally made using a regionalization technique based on a regional database of observed rainfalls. Many countries have derived their own generalized <b>design</b> <b>rainfall</b> data, which are generally expressed {{in the form of}} intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves. In Qatar, situated in an arid region, the existing IDF data were developed in 1991 using a limited data set. This paper presents the development of new IDF data for the State of Qatar using the method of L-moments and the index regional frequency analysis approach. The daily rainfall data from 32 stations located in Qatar and nearby Gulf countries have been used to form a homogeneous region. It has been found that the Pearson Type 3 distribution best fits the 24 -h duration annual maximum rainfall data in the Qatar region. For the ungauged case, a prediction equation is developed where mean annual maximum rainfall is expressed as a function of climatic and physiographic characteristics. From a leave-one-out validation, it has been found that the developed prediction equation can estimate mean annual maximum rainfall with a median relative error of about 5. 5 %. Finally, an approximate method is used to obtain <b>design</b> <b>rainfalls</b> for other durations due to the limitations of continuous pluviograph data in Qatar. The new set of IDF curves is based on a much bigger dataset than the existing 1991 IDF curves. It is expected that the new IDF curves will have wider application in Qatar and will provide a statistically sound basis for storm water design, flood and environmental studies. The method can be applied to other middle-eastern states and similar arid countries in the world...|$|R

However, the GIS-based measurement was not accurate for a site with complex vegetation coverage.

As a result, the functions of both <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> were close to identical under the ambient condition since it did not result in drainage. In contrast, under the flood condition, the geocomposite edge drain could remove excess water more efficiently than the conventional toe drain. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
