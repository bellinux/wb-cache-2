5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria <b>give</b> <b>their</b> symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E

According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to <b>give</b> <b>their</b> support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

The operation ended on 1July after 2,718 suspects had been arrested.

5|$|Pelicans <b>give</b> <b>their</b> {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, {{an order}} which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to <b>give</b> <b>their</b> daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when they were seen to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|The {{article was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to <b>give</b> <b>their</b> suggestions on how to improve Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as the problematic situation for unmarried middle class women. Without a spouse a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E

5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought.

Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects <b>give</b> <b>their</b> preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think.

5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall <b>give</b> <b>their</b> Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
