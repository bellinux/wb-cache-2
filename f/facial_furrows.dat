40|$|Most {{automatic}} expression analysis systems {{attempt to}} recognize a small set of prototypic expressions (e. g. happiness and anger). Such prototypic expressions, however, occur infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are communicated more often by changes {{in one or two}} discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an automatic system to analyze subtle changes in facial expressions based on both permanent (e. g. mouth, eye, and brow) and transient (e. g. furrows and wrinkles) facial features in a nearly frontal image sequence. Multi-state facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling different facial features. Based on these multi-state models, and without artificial enhancement, we detect and track the facial features, including mouth, eyes, brow, cheeks, and their related wrinkles and <b>facial</b> <b>furrows.</b> Moreover we recover detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features.

40|$|Accurately and robustly {{tracking}} {{facial features}} must {{cope with the}} large variation in appearance across subjects and the combination of rigid and non-rigid motion. We present a work toward a robust system to detect and track facial features including both permanent (e. g. mouth, eye, and brow) and transient (e. g. furrows and wrinkles) facial features in a nearly frontal image sequence. Multi-state facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling different facial features. Based on these multi-state models, and without any artificial enhancement, we detect and track the facial features, including mouth, eyes, brows, cheeks, and their related wrinkles and <b>facial</b> <b>furrows</b> by combining color, shape, edge and motion information. Given the initial location of the facial features in the first frame, the facial features can be detected or tracked in remainder images automatically. Our system is tested on 500 image sequences from the Pittsburgh-Carnegie Mellon University (Pitt-CMU) [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractÐMost {{automatic}} expression analysis systems {{attempt to}} recognize a small set of prototypic expressions, such as happiness, anger, surprise, and fear. Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in {{one or a few}} discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of <b>facial</b> <b>furrows)</b> in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96. 4 percent (95. 4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96. 7 percent (95. 6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.

40|$|Background: Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHOA 1) {{is a rare}} genetic {{condition}} {{caused by}} mutation of the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HDPG) gene leading to prostaglandin excess, with digital clubbing, acro-osteolysis, periostitis, arthropathy and skin changes including pachyderma, hyperhydrosis and excessive <b>facial</b> <b>furrowing</b> [1]. Radiological findings previously described include plain radiographic changes with irregular periosteal proliferation, cortical thickening of long bones and acro-osteolysis. Bone scintigraphy identifies characteristic changes of symmetrically increased pericor-tical linear uptake of the tracer along the distal ends of long bones [2]. Joint US examination {{has been reported in}} one case only revealing synovitis and inflammation. Management options described in case reports include long-term NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, DMARDS, infliximab and arthroscopic synovectomy with variable symptomatic relief, and no improvement in established plain radiographic changes...|$|R
40|$|Background and ObjectivesZZFacial {{sequelae}} after {{facial paralysis}} cause serious functional and aesthetical problems including facial asymmetry, symkinesis and facial crease. The most common aesthetical problem is <b>facial</b> <b>furrow</b> and crease induced by facial hyperkinestic move-ment due to incomplete facial recovery. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the efficacy of bot-ulinum toxin A injection in patients with deep nasolabial fold and bitterness <b>furrow</b> after <b>facial</b> paralysis. Subjects and MethodZZThirty-five patients who recovered partially from facial paralysis, had deep nasolabial fold and bitterness furrow with or without facial asymmetry. Botulinum toxin A intramuscular injection on perioral area for mouth corner deviation, subcutaneous in-jection on deepen nasolabial fold, and intramuscular injection on bitterness furrows had improved lower facial symmetry and cosmetic configuration without Pseudo Bell’s palsy. ResultsZZOf 26 patients who had facial palsy side nasolabial fold before the injection, 21 patients improved. Of the 21 patients who had facial palsy side bitterness furrow, 16 patients improved af-ter the injection. Of 11 patients who had contralateral nasolabial fold, 4 patients improved after the injection. Of 13 patients who had contralateral bitterness furrow, 7 patients improved after th...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The use of dermal filling {{techniques}} for soft tissue augmentation has greatly increased in recent years. Hyaluronic acid {{is one of}} the most used temporary dermal fillers in the treatment of <b>facial</b> wrinkles, <b>furrows,</b> and folds due to its effectiveness and safety. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Perfectha®, a new hyaluronic acid filler, for nasolabial folds and lip correction. Methods: Open, multicenter study comprising 87 women. Efficacy was evaluated by the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale and the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale. Safety was evaluated through observation and the reporting of side effects. Results: One week after the injection of the filler, improvement in nasolabial folds and lips was observed in 86 % and 89 % of the women, respectively. Mild or moderate transient inflammatory reaction and ecchymoses occurred in 15 % and 9 % of patients, respectively, mainly in nasolabial folds. Two patients presented labial herpes simplex after treatment of the lips. The good results were maintained in 76 % and 57 % of women for nasolabial folds and in 72 % and 45 % of women for lips after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion: Perfectha® was effective and safe for these indications...|$|R
