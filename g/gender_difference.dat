40|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> in {{conversation}} topics were first systematically studied in 1922 by Henry Moore, who theorized that the <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in topic choice he {{observed in a}} field observation study would persist over time, as they were manifestations of men's and women's “original natures. ” In this paper, I report a 1990 replication of Moore's study, in which similar but smaller <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in topic choice are found. In order to explore further the apparent trend toward smaller <b>gender</b> <b>differences,</b> reports of quantitative observation studies conducted between 1922 and 1990 are examined. Other explanations besides change over time—such as variations {{in conversation}} setting and audience, target populations, and researcher's intentions—may account for the decline in <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in topic choice. Social influences are seen more clearly in the discourse about <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in conversation than in <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in conversation topics themselves...|$|R

25|$|Agoraphobia occurs {{about twice}} as {{commonly}} among women {{as it does in}} men. The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidance coping strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors), women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic. Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in agoraphobia.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties.

Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E

25|$|A {{study done}} by Harris (2002) tested these {{hypotheses}} among 210 individuals, 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men. Results {{found that more}} heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity, with heterosexual men being the highest, and that when forced to choose, gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be more troubling than sexual infidelity (Harris, 2002). These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion {{that there would be}} no <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation; however more research in this area should be conducted. Blow and Bartlett (2005) suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship might be seen as more acceptable in some relationships, the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, especially for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women. This is because it is thought that the threat of cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring that is another male's, and for females, emotional infidelity would be more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment in their offspring for another woman's offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However the evidence for this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> is debatable, as new findings are suggesting that more and more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse (Harris, 2002).|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Advanced cancer {{patients}} are multi-symptomatic and require attentive palliative care. As <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> are apparent in multiple aspect of everyday life, this literature review aims {{to determine the}} <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> seen in the population of advanced {{cancer patients}} and the symptoms that they experience. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the OvidSP Medline database from 1946 to November 2012. Randomized, prospective or retrospective cohort studies on advanced cancer patients who were undergoing any type of palliative treatments (palliative radiation, chemotherapy) or those in which palliative treatments have failed (antalgic treatment) were included. The patient population, tools/questionnaire used and <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in symptoms found statistically or qualitatively significant in the respective studies were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 163 studies resulting from the literature search, nineteen publications were identified. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> in multiple symptoms were discovered. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> were commonly found in symptoms of emotional changes, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) anxiety, tension, sleep problems and pain. CONCLUSION: At present, <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> seen in the symptoms experienced by advanced cancer patients continues to be inconclusive. Further study investigating <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in the symptoms experienced by advanced cancer patients as the primary endpoint is recommended. </p...|$|R
25|$|Gender is {{a factor}} that {{plays a role in}} both human and animal aggression. Males are {{historically}} believed to be generally more physically aggressive than females from an early age, and men commit the vast majority of murders (Buss 2005). This {{is one of the most}} robust and reliable behavioral sex differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and cultures. However, some empirical studies have found the discrepancy in male and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context. Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al. 2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically. When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as relational aggression and social rejection, some scientists argue that females can be quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically. An exception is intimate partner violence that occurs among couples who are engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate relationship. In such cases, some research suggests that women are more physically aggressive than men, although differences are small and men are less likely to be injured than women are.|$|E

Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age (e.g., puberty) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan.
