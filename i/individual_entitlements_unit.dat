40|$|In {{an estate}} {{division}} problem an estate {{has to be}} divided among several players whose total entitlement to the estate exceeds its size. This paper extends the non-cooperative approach through a claim game, as initiated by O'Neill (1982), by allowing players to put multiple claims on the same part of the estate, and by considering the case where <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> may exceed the estate. A full characterization of the set of Nash equilibria of the claim game is obtained both for restricted estate division problems, where <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> do not exceed the estate, and for the general case. Variations on the claim game are considered, which result in proportional division in equilibrium. Bankruptcy problem Estate division problem Non-cooperative claim game...|$|R

Therefore {{the purpose of the}} paper was to explore and substantiate themes associated with perceived entitlements and utilise this information to develop a structural model of the anticipatory psychological contract. The findings suggest that there are certain factors that determine an <b>individual’s</b> <b>entitlement</b> beliefs, and in turn that <b>individual’s</b> <b>entitlement</b> beliefs will influence the level of expectation of that individual regarding future employment. By fully comprehending the effects of the entitlement beliefs on the anticipatory psychological contract of prospective employees the organisation may minimise the occurrence of psychological breach or violation, which may decrease new employee turnover.

25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice.

40|$|The {{title of}} my thesis already {{indicates}} that I did my research {{on what is}} called a hot topic: pensions in Europe. In all countries, pensions are built up through the labour market. This is true in two perspectives: firstly, for the <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> and, secondly, for the financial means. With other words, the legitimation and the source of pensions are channelled through the wage. This logic is obsolete in present-day economies since the units of social rights changed as well as the economic and demographic situation. One should not forget that it is several decades ago that the different pension systems were introduced. Since then, the dynamics of capitalist economies changed the variables of the system and their interrelatedness. Consequently, reform policies need to be accompanied by updating the assumptions of the original systems. I approached the problematic institutionalization of the life-course and of resource flows through two concepts, that of the life course, put forward by Martin Kohli, and that of instituted economic processes, put forward by Karl Polanyi. Based on this comprehensive and anthropological approach the result of my research is that different countries' pension logics need to be combined and redefined. Let me concentrate on the <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> first. Recent pension reforms tie pension rights to an ideal work biographies. In addition, they transform pensions to <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> by abolishing derived rights such as widows pensions. This pension logic, one might say, assumes an adult worker model, as Jane Lewis called it. This adult worker model, however, is not to be found in any European country. In addition, the calculation norms of pensions even widen the well-known gender wage gap. Therefore, I analysed welfare systems in more detail and also other but labour market entitlements. These are on the one hand, countries that value learning periods and caring responsibilities, such as France, Austria, and Germany, and, on the other hand, countries whose pension systems entail residency based pensions, such as Denmark or the Netherlands. And although these systems are better from a practical as well as normative point of view, full pensions are, also in these systems, linked to an individual work biography in an ideal and therefore non-adequate way. My research also showed that recent reforms do not improve individual pension rights. Nonetheless, <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements,</b> and those of women in particular, are increasingly important since pension systems develop from a social insurance to a kind of individual account and investment system. This is even more the case since retrenchments of public pensions ask for building up pensions in several schemes which generally calculate entitlements on a more direct link to paid contributions. Let me now come to the second side of the pension coin which is that of resources. Welfare arrangements are still financed through the wage, either through contributions or through taxation. However, the wage-relatedness of resource flows is problematic since life courses change so that relatively shorter periods of time are spent in paid employment and relatively more periods of time are spent on education and retirement. Changing policies to stimulate longer working biographies are first efforts to ease this misbalance of 'producing' resources and benefiting from them. However, since education and care is increasingly part of the agenda as necessary means to sustain capitalist economies, it seems necessary to include other but financial resources. In concrete, there are academic demands to include 'solidaric elements' (a term put forward by John Myles), which is care in particular, in the calculation of the GNP. In short, the different economic modes of market exchange, welfare economies, household economies and voluntary activities need to be taken into consideration. As a consequence, sustainable welfare systems need to include more than labour market related entitlements into their pension norms. Pensions then would be composed of a variety of pension entitlements linked to contributions that go beyond the labour market...|$|R

The article compares the book's conceptual approach and policy recommendations {{to those of other}} recent writings on poverty and hunger. Researchers trying to understand the causes of a particular famine or to anticipate future famines have usually concentrated on information about aggregate food availability. A better approach is to focus on the determinants of <b>individual</b> <b>entitlements</b> - the command of people over food and other necessities. Ravallion critically assesses the book's conceptual framework, data, and the methods of analysis. He concludes that, despite some shortcomings in the book, the authors make a convincing case for a positive role for public action in famine relief and longer term relief of poverty and hunger.
