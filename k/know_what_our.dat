6000|$|... “If {{you have}} missed {{anything}} of yours upstairs, my dear young Monsieur, you mustn’t say it’s me. You don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> Rita is.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{the holy}} Saints were--and {{look at the}} Crucifix, Carloman. That was for them that hated Him. And, don't you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> Pater Noster says?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the morning}} express. It wasn't {{much of a}} job to persuade the {{conductor}} to slow up about here when he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> business was." ...|$|R
60|$|Aum. What he, {{and all of}} us have done, is <b>known.</b> <b>What's</b> <b>our</b> reward? Our {{offices are}} lost, Turned out, like laboured oxen after harvest, To the bare commons of the {{withered}} field.|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{not a very}} ambitious program,” Bethune laughed. “I {{dare say}} we can carry it out; though we don’t <b>know</b> yet <b>what</b> <b>our</b> share will come to.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{friend said}} in that Russian {{manuscript}} I lent you," [...] he reminded her: [...] "'The primitive laws are for the primitive world.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I was {{not quite}} {{out of the reach}} of surprises, after all. Why, how you talk! Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> crop is going to foot up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All {{that the}} priming does for the cannon, Mr. Meredith,' {{answered}} Redgauntlet; 'it {{will enable us}} to seize Carlisle, and you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> friends have engaged for in that case.' ...|$|E
50|$|We do not <b>know</b> or seek <b>what</b> <b>our</b> fate will be.|$|R
6000|$|... "And we will," [...] Billy rejoined {{with great}} positiveness. [...] "It's {{us for the}} San Joaquin. We don't <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> in <b>our</b> country. No wonder we're out on the stoop." ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the knowledge economy, smart corporations begin to realize that the proverbial "if we only <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we know" also includes "if we only <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> customers <b>know.</b> " In this paper, the authors discuss the concept of Customer Knowledge Management (CKM), which refers to the management of knowledge from customers, i. e. knowledge resident in customers, in contrast to knowledge about customers, e. g. customer characteristics and preferences prevalent in previous work on knowledge management and customer relationship management. Subsequently, five styles of CKM are proposed and practically illustrated by way of corporate examples...|$|R

6000|$|When {{they were}} in the streets she said: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{landlord}} will say to my bringing you home in this state. I expect we are fastened out, so that he'll have to come down and let us in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} have said so," [...] he answered. [...] "She was willing to marry me when your father ordered it. You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{engagement}} was like. We were called into the parlour the Sunday morning before I--I--you remember my trial Sunday at Feldwick? ...|$|E
60|$|We stretch {{our hands}} like {{children}} to the light, seeking to grasp we <b>know</b> not <b>what.</b> <b>Our</b> thoughts, like the boys' thoughts in the Danish song, are very long, long thoughts, and very vague; we cannot see their end.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, the shell fish called oysters are readily cooked, {{or may be}} eaten raw with great satisfaction. I <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>our</b> people of Virginia would have done without them, {{and yet it was}} only by chance or {{accident}} that we came to learn how nourishing they are.|$|R
6000|$|... "The leathernecks was layin' aft at the double, an' a more insanitary set of {{accidents}} I never wish to behold. Most of 'em {{was in their}} shirts. They had their trousers on, of course--rolled up nearly to the knee, but what I mean is belts over shirts. Three or four 'ad our caps, an' them that had drawn helmets wore their chin-straps like Portugee earrings. Oh, yes; an' three of 'em 'ad only one boot! I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> bafflin' tattics was goin' to be, but even I was mildly surprised when this gay fantasia of Brazee drummers halted under the poop, because of an 'ammick in charge of our Navigator, an' a small but 'ighly efficient landin'-party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] exclaimed Jack, suddenly, {{and held}} up his hand, [...] "this won't do at all. The folks downstairs will think we're pulling the house down over their ears. We'll have to slow up a bit. You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> fathers said a little while ago." ...|$|E
60|$|They made {{signs to}} the natives for some food, {{and they went}} and fetched several herbs and roots, and some milk; but it was evident they did not design to give it away, but to sell it, making signs to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> men would give them.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Count," [...] she said, [...] "you do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{expenses}} are. Jeanne is extravagant, so am I extravagant. It is {{all very}} well for her, but for me it is another matter. I shall be a poor woman when I have resigned my charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{friend told}} you," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite continued, with a gleam of humour in his eyes. [...] "He {{reminded}} {{you that the}} first duty of a diplomat--of a young diplomat especially--is to keep on friendly terms with the governing members {{of the country to}} which he is accredited. How's that, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is written,' {{said the}} Rabbi, '"Thou shalt have none other God but me." [...] Now <b>know</b> ye <b>what</b> <b>our</b> father Abraham said when Nimrod {{ordered him to}} worship fire?

But you see, papa, we don't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> other things are to be." ...|$|E
60|$|Luckily, however, I had {{sufficient}} sense to give warning {{that all those}} who had been enrolled as Minute Boys should stay near to their own homes until {{it might be possible to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> people intended to do, and at the same time hold themselves in readiness for any summons which might come.|$|E
6000|$|Our Saviour {{commands}} us, {{in works}} of charity, to [...] "let not our left hand <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> right hand doeth;" [...] which cannot well consist with our being willed, required, and commanded by any earthly power, where no law is prescribed, to publish our charity to the world, {{if we have}} a mind to conceal it.|$|E
40|$|Education Working Team. Three themes {{emerged from}} the articles. 1. Knowledge Is Power. Whether it’s a home that is imminently {{threatened}} by wildfire or a child far away worrying {{about the fate of}} wild animals during a fire, people want and need information about fire issues. When well informed, {{people are more likely to}} support fire management. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> audiences need and want helps to make us better communicators. 2. Trust Fosters Good Communications. Listening to, understanding, and enlisting the help of local folks is an effective way to spread the word. How well messages are received often depends on how well the messenger is trusted. 3. Details Matter. Everything we say and do—from the words we choose to the way we dress or act—influences our communications. People respond better to everyday language, and they appreciate direct interaction and hands-on activitie...|$|R
5000|$|... “We don't really <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> {{happening}} in <b>our</b> economy," [...] Ms. Beck said. [...] "I'm hoping there's an optimism in that final text, {{and that it}} comes together {{as a bit of}} a narrative. That's my hope; to think positive." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>know</b> that <b>what</b> <b>our</b> {{neighbours}} call [...] "longueurs," [...] (We've {{not so good}} a word, {{but have}} the thing, [...] In that complete perfection which insures [...] An epic from Bob Southey every spring--) [...] Form not the true temptation which allures [...] The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring [...] Some fine examples of the Epopée, [...] To prove its grand ingredient is Ennui.[216] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she {{acknowledged}} with some bitterness; [...] "but I can hardly complain that I {{have no control}} over him. It would be astonishing if I had." [...] She broke into a little harsh laugh. [...] "Anyway, I manage to keep my head, and do not deceive myself, as he does. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> welcome's worth and what the few people whose opinion counts for anything think of us." ...|$|E
60|$|A splendid story, {{the scene}} {{shifting}} from Maine to Michigan and the Great Lakes, {{and then to}} the Columbia and the Great North-west. The heroes are two sturdy youths who have been brought up among the lumbermen of their native State, and who strike out in an honest endeavor to better their condition. An ideal volume for every wide-awake American who wishes to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> great lumber industry is to-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{may look}} forward to very much harder work {{tomorrow}} than we have had today," [...] Captain Johnson said.

6000|$|... "Friend Magloire," [...] said Lomaque, winking mildly, [...] "your last remark {{looks to}} me like a {{question}} in disguise. I put questions constantly to others; I never answer questions myself. You want to <b>know,</b> citizen, <b>what</b> <b>our</b> superintendent's secret motive is for denouncing his wife's brother? Suppose you try and find that out for yourself. It will be famous practice for you, friend Magloire--famous practice after office hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|JULIA (suddenly {{throwing}} herself tragically on {{her knees}} at Grace's feet). Don't take him from me. Oh don't--don't be so cruel. Give him back to me. You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you're doing--what <b>our</b> past has been--how I love him. You don't know-- ...|$|R
6000|$|No. But {{they are}} {{probably}} true. He was a feeble brat from the [...] first. I believe they had to baptize him {{on the day he}} was born.
