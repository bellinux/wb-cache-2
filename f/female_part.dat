(2007) found that there is sexual selection in mating with snails of the opposite chirality. This means that the left-handed snails mate more often with right-handed snails than they do with snails of the same coiling. Additionally there are anatomical adaptations of the spermatophore and of the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> of the reproductive system {{for the success of}} these matings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1933, MGM staff {{realized}} that additional footage was needed to complete the film. This involved casting an actress for the role. The production staff visited San Francisco, California, to identify an actress for a minor <b>female</b> <b>part.</b> Ray Mala offered the role of Iva to Sadie Brower, a 17-year-old half-Inupiat girl. But after her father refused to let her appear in movies, a Japanese American (who could not speak any Eskimo) was cast in the role instead. According to Brower, this woman's Eskimo {{was so bad that}} it was unintelligible. Dortuk, Elik, Kemasuk, Nunooruk, and four other Inupiat actors were brought to California to act in the reshoots and new scenes.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{remained}} with Mr. Palmer's {{company at the}} Madison Square Theatre until 1894, upon joining Charles Frohman's company, Empire Stock. She returned to the stage in 1894, playing the lead <b>female</b> <b>part</b> in The New Woman. She reprised her role in Esmerelda in 1894 as well. By 1895, Annie Russell appeared in {{an increasing number of}} plays. She performed in a new one-act play called Lethe. Later that year, she appeared in a prelude to Romeo and Juliet called Romeo's First Love and in The Gilded Fool, which earned Russell more critical acclaim. Towards the end of the year, she took a new role in Senator and Ingenue as Ruth.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the first}} {{national}} theatre was founded in the old premises at Bollhuset, Stockholm in 1737, where only foreign theatre troupes had previously performed, they were only male actors in the original native troupe, and so the theatre advertised for women to play the <b>female</b> <b>parts</b> before the theatre's formal premiere. In Sweden, unlike in some other countries, {{there was never any}} real opposition against women performing on the stage. It was considered natural to have women perform the <b>female</b> <b>parts</b> in the plays, and on 25 May 1737, two women were hired to perform the <b>female</b> <b>parts.</b> One was deemed not suitable, but the other was Straas.|$|R

25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} set in the present on the campus of a {{university}} in fictional Churchton, Illinois, modeled on Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where Bertram Cope, an attractive young English instructor, is spending a year completing his thesis. While he has a certain sophistication, he is socially unaware, easily impressed by the wealthy and their comforts. Lacking confidence, Cope is too careful and self-conscious as he tries to find his place in local society. Cope becomes the elusive object of desire, either social or sexual or some combination of the two, for an older woman, two older men, and three young women. Cope's primary emotional attachment is to his college chum Arthur Lemoyne, who comes to live with him. Their relationship appears to end after Lemoyne, acting the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> in a play, makes a physical advance backstage that offends another male student.|$|E

It also tells that when the demon Andhaka wanted to seize Parvati and make her his wife, Vishnu rescued her and brought her to his abode. When the demon followed her there, Parvati revealed her Ardhanarishvara form to him. Seeing the half-male, half-female form, the demon lost interest in her and left. Vishnu was amazed to see this form and saw himself in the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> of the form.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{groups of}} flowering plants among the Magnoliids {{and the families}} Choranthaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Annonaceae, and Aristolochiaceae are bisexual with both male and <b>female</b> <b>parts</b> present and functional within the usually large floral structure. The main pollinators of these flowers were beetles, flies and thrips. They evolved mechanisms to reduce self-pollination by changing the timing of maturity of the male and <b>female</b> <b>parts.</b> This altered timing mechanism or dichogamy was principally expressed by protogyny or the early maturation of the <b>female</b> <b>parts</b> and only rarely by protandry or the early maturation of the male parts. The early flowers were principally flat and dish-like with the evolution of deeper corolla tubes being a later innovation and principally associated with long-tongued pollinators such as moths. There are {{a large number of}} other mechanisms that enhance cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination. The forces that lead to the evolution of such systems as bearing male and female flowers on separate kinds of plants is still unclear.|$|R

500|$|The palace {{consists}} {{of a total of}} 150 rooms, the principal of which are panelled with wood block floors. Inside the corps de logis, it had been Blore's intention to follow the English 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms; with a library, dining rooms and billiard room ensuite to left of the central hall for men, and a massive drawing room to the right for women. This layout of gender designated zones had become popular in Victorian England; however its intention was not to segregate the sexes, but more to define furnishings – the male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark 'Turkey' carpets, whereas the female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood, Aubusson carpets and chintz soft furnishings. However, for unknown reasons, this [...] concept was never executed and the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> of the house was extended into the male territory, with the intended billiard room becoming the countess's boudoir while the study became a further small sitting room for feminine use. Above these seaward facing rooms were the family bedrooms.|$|E
50|$|This is a tree {{growing up}} to 12 meters tall. It occurs in forests in moist {{mountain}} gulches which {{are dominated by}} hala (Pandanus tectorius), a common tree of the Pacific Islands. The leaves are roughly oval in shape and up to 40 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a branching panicle of flowers, each main branch bearing up to 100 flowers. Like other plants of its genus, this species is gynodioecious; most of the plants have bisexual flowers with male and <b>female</b> <b>parts,</b> but some have only female flowers. Some of the <b>female</b> <b>parts</b> in the bisexual flowers are abortive or nonfuctional, indicating that the species {{is in the middle}} of an evolution toward a fully dioecious system; eventually some flowers might start developing without the <b>female</b> <b>parts.</b> If the species becomes dioecious, some individuals will produce all male flowers and some will bear all female. This species has smaller seeds than any other of its genus.|$|R

2500|$|Self-pollination {{occurs when}} pollen from one flower pollinates the same flower or other flowers {{of the same}} individual. [...] It {{is thought to have}} evolved under {{conditions}} when pollinators were not reliable vectors for pollen transport, and is most often seen in short-lived annual species and plants that colonize new locations. Self-pollination may include autogamy, where pollen is transferred to the <b>female</b> <b>part</b> of the same flower; or geitonogamy, when pollen is transferred to another flower on the same plant. Plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar stamen and carpel lengths. Plants that can pollinate themselves and produce viable offspring are called self-fertile. Plants that cannot fertilize themselves are called self-sterile, a condition which mandates cross-pollination for the production of offspring.|$|E

2500|$|MacGowan {{had decided}} to name the song after J. P. Donleavy's 1973 novel A Fairy Tale of New York, which Finer was reading {{at the time and}} had left lying around the {{recording}} studio. In the same Melody Maker interview MacGowan expressed regret that the song had not been completed in time to be released for Christmas that year, and hinted that the track would appear on an EP that The Pogues were due to record shortly. In January 1986 the group recorded the song during the sessions with Costello that would produce the Poguetry in Motion EP, with bass player Cait O'Riordan singing the <b>female</b> <b>part.</b> Costello suggested naming the song [...] "Christmas Eve in the Drunk Tank", after the song's opening lines: the band were scornful of the suggestion, with MacGowan pointing out to Costello that a song with such a title was unlikely to be favourably received and played by radio stations. The majority of the lyrics had been written while MacGowan was recovering in a bed in Malmö after being struck down with double pneumonia during a Pogues tour of Scandinavia in late 1985 – he later said, [...] "you get a lot of delirium and stuff, so I got quite a few good images out of that". However, despite several attempts at recording it, the group were unhappy with the results and the song was temporarily put aside, to be returned to at a later date. Guitarist Philip Chevron later said, [...] "It was not quite there. It needed to have a full-on, confident performance from the band, which it lacked." [...] The producer of the final version, Steve Lillywhite, diplomatically described the version recorded with O'Riordan's vocals as not [...] "fully realised". Extracts from these earlier versions can be heard on the 2008 box set Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say... POGUEMAHONE!!.|$|E
