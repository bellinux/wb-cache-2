50|$|The fluid {{reservoir}} {{is connected to}} the collabsible bladder. The lower end of the bladder is connected to a flexible tube made of synthetic rubber or PVC. The first bit of the flexible tube that begins {{at the lower end of}} the bladder is 'U' shaped by using an <b>elastic</b> <b>connector</b> or a wire spiral. The end of the flexible tube were the water flows out is open to the atmospheric pressure. If the vertical height from the reservoir to the bladder is less than from the ground to the bladder and during a certain flow rate the bladder performs an interesting phenomenon of collapsing and opening along with the generation of a pulsatile flow of the liquid. The cause of this phenomenon can be explained by the functioning of the Starling resistor which produces self-excited oscillations caused by fluid-structure interaction in an elastic tube due to sudden stoppage of flow. This pulsatile flow generator can actually be seen as a modification of the Starling resistor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a robotic arm is {{modelled}} by a double pendulum excited in its base by a DC motor of limited power via crank mechanism and <b>elastic</b> <b>connector.</b> In the mathematical model, a chaotic motion was identified, {{for a wide}} range of parameters. Controlling of the chaotic behaviour of the system, were implemented using, two control techniques, the nonlinear saturation control (NSC) and the optimal linear feedback control (OLFC). The actuator and sensor of the device are allowed in the pivot and joints of the double pendulum. The nonlinear saturation control (NSC) is based in the order second differential equations and its action in the pivot/joint of the robotic arm is through of quadratic nonlinearities feedback signals. The optimal linear feedback control (OLFC) involves the application of two control signals, a nonlinear feedforward control to maintain the controlled system to a desired periodic orbit, and control a feedback control to bring the trajectory of the system to the desired orbit. Simulation results, including of uncertainties show the feasibility of the both methods, for chaos control of the considered system. ...|$|E

This thesis explores an attenuation technique that rethinks {{the design of}} simple lightweight flexible structures, providing {{an alternative to the}} current methods of active controllers and heavy damping. Through multi-element/multi-path (MEMP) design, a structure is divided up into several constituent substructures with separate, elastically coupled, wave transmission paths that utilize the inherent dynamics of the system to achieve substantial wide-band reductions in the low frequency range while satisfying constraints on static strength and weight. Attenuation is achieved through several processes acting in concert: different subsystem wave speeds, mixed boundary conditions at end points, interaction through elastic couplings, and stop band behavior. The technique is first introduced into thin beams coupled with discrete axial and torsional springs, resulting in wide-band attenuation and agreement between analytical simulations and experimental studies. MEMP design is then implemented into concentric thin cylindrical shells, providing a more three-dimensional study with axially discrete azimuthally-continuous <b>elastic</b> <b>connectors.</b> By employing a modal decomposition of the governing shell equations, simulations reveal more opportunities for attenuation when subjected to various forcing conditions. Future work examines the effect of MEMP shell design on acoustic scattering reduction. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Very {{few studies}} concern the {{isotropic}} phase of Side-Chain Liquid-Crystalline Polymers (SCLCPs). However, the {{interest for the}} isotropic phase appears particularly obvious in flow experiments. Unforeseen shear-induced nematic phases are revealed away from the N-I transition temperature. The non-equilibrium nematic phase in the isotropic phase of SCLCP melts challenges the conventional timescales described in theoretical approaches and reveal very long timescales, neglected until now. This spectacular behavior is the starter of the present survey that reveals long range solid-like interactions up to the sub-millimetre scale. We {{address the question of}} the origin of this solid-like property by probing more particularly the non-equilibrium behavior of a polyacrylate substituted by a nitrobiphenyl group (PANO 2). The comparison with a polybutylacrylate chain of the same degree of polymerization evidences that the solid-like response is exacerbated in SCLCPs. We conclude that the liquid crystal moieties interplay as efficient <b>elastic</b> <b>connectors.</b> Finally, we show that the “solid” character can be evidenced away from the glass transition temperature in glass formers and for the first time, in purely alkane chains above their crystallization temperature. We thus have probed collective elastic effects contained not only in the isotropic phase of SCLCPs, but also more generically in the liquid state of ordinary melts and of ordinary liquids...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergent}} {{popularity of}} {{wireless sensor networks}} and cloud-computing services brings us new opportu-nities of integrating them for performing on-the- y sensor-data analysis with as many computing resources as needed. Yet, users are required to integrate sen-sor networks and cloud services manually, and even to redesign their data-analyzing software for its paral-lelization. To alleviate these problems, we are devel-oping an agent-based workbench that consists of three independent but interlinked software tools: (1) the AgentTeamwork-Lite job coordinator, (2) the MASS middleware library, and (3) the <b>Connector</b> <b>elastic</b> data channel. AgentTeamwork-Lite has each computing node exchange resource information with neighbors, and deploys {{a job with a}} mobile agent that searches for idle nodes. MASS allows programmers to view their ap-plications as a series of interaction among autonomic computation entities that are dynamically mapped to a cluster of multi-core machines. Connector separates descriptions of network address, communication pro-tocol, and data-sampling conditions from applications. It automatically streams and hands o sensor data to migrating jobs.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{roles of}} sarcomere-associated cytoskeletal lattices were investigated {{by studying the}} resting tension-sarcomere length curves of mechanically skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibers {{over a wide range}} of sarcomere strain. Correlative immunoelectron microscopy of the elastic titin filaments of the endosarcomeric lattice revealed biphasic extensibility behaviors and provided a structural interpretation of the multiphasic tension-length curves. We propose that the reversible change of contour length of the extensible segment of titin between the Z line and the end of thick filaments underlies the exponential rise of resting tension. At and beyond an elastic limit near 3. 8 microns, a portion of the anchored titin segment that adheres to thick filaments is released from the distal ends of thick filament. This increase in extensible length of titin results in a net length increase in the unstrained extensible segment, thereby lowering the stiffness of the fiber, lengthening the slack sarcomere length, and shifting the yield point in postyield sarcomeres. Thus, the titin-myosin composite filament behaves as a dual-stage molecular spring, consisting of an <b>elastic</b> <b>connector</b> segment for normal response and a longer latent segment that is recruited at and beyond the elastic limit of the sarcomere. Exosarcomeric intermediate filaments contribute to resting tension only above 4. 5 microns. We conclude that the interlinked endo- and exosarcomeric lattices are both viscoelastic force-bearing elements. These distinct cytoskeletal lattices appear to operate over two ranges of sarcomere strains and collectively enable myofibrils to respond viscoelastically over a broad range of sarcomere and fiber lengths...|$|E
40|$|In steel-concrete {{composite}} girders, composite dowels can be {{used for}} the efficient and safe transfer of shear forces between the concrete slab and the steel section. However, important aspects of their load bearing and deformation behavior are not clarified, so far. This is where the present thesis begins. In the first step, the influence of transverse concrete cracks on the shear capacity of composite dowels was investigated. Transverse concrete cracks detach the occurring pry-out cones and reduce the shear stresses that can be transferred by aggregate interlock. In consequences, the shear capacity of composite dowels reduces in cracked concrete. For the analysis of the internal load bearing mechanisms, shear tests with different crack widths and at different crack spacing were carried out. Since well-known design approaches neglect the influence of transverse cracks, a novel mechanically based pry-out model was developed, validated by a test database and transferred to the design load level. In the next step, the load-bearing behavior of composite dowels was analyzed under tensile, compressive and combined shear and tensile loads. For the tensile and compressive capacity of single dowels and dowel groups in cracked and non-cracked concrete, design approaches were developed. These approaches are based on models for pairs of headed stud connectors on rigid anchor plates. Furthermore, an interaction model was setup for the assessment of combined tensile and shear loads. To allow for plastic design of composite beams, the shear connectors have to provide sufficient ductility and deformation capacity. The present thesis proposes models to describe the nonlinear relationship between shear load and slip, based on the shear capacity and the <b>elastic</b> <b>connector</b> stiffness. These models are used to define structural boundary conditions (such as concrete cover and dowel dimensions), that ensure a ductile deformation behavior according to EC 4 (deformability> 6 mm). In the next step the nonlinear shear force- slip characteristics were implemented into non-linear FE simulations of composite beams with partial shear connection and single flange. Comprehensive parameter studies were performed in order to find the minimum degree of partial shear connection for different beam spans, dowel characteristics, dimensions of the composite cross section and loading situations. Finally, the shear force-bearing behavior of composite beams with composite dowels was analyzed at large web openings. A novel engineer model was developed, considering Vierendeel failure, shear failure of the concrete slab and failure of the connectors on the opening edges. Here, the previously developed approaches for the shear, tensile and compression behavior of composite dowels were incorporated. The model approach was validated by beam tests and converted into a practical design approach...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of sound begins when energy derived from acoustic stimuli deflects the hair bundles {{on top of}} hair cells. As hair bundles move, the viscous friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental challenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part of {{the solution to this}} problem lies in the active process that uses energy for frequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a complementary part of the solution involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid within the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a dynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric measurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the forces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least dissipative coherent mode, whereas the <b>elastic</b> horizontal top <b>connectors</b> that stabilize the structure further reduce the drag. As measured from the distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of viscous and elastic forces in a hair bundle permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses only a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments and detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive mechanotransduction...|$|R
