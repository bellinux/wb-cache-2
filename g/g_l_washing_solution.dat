40|$|International audienceMineralogical and geochemical {{analyses}} of the environmental components {{in the vicinity of}} the abandoned mines of Jebel Hallouf-Sidi Bouaouane have shown that large volumes of flotation tailings are made of base metal sufides (galena, sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite) accompanied with lesser amounts of sulfosalts (jordanite, tennantite) and associated to a carbonated (calcite) and clayey (kaolinite, illite) matrix. Strong heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cd) concentrations are recorded in soil and flotation tailings. Their concentrations in the flotation tailings are around 9250 mg. kg - 1, 8200 mg. kg - 1 and 66. 5 mg. kg - 1, respectively. Their mean concentrations in the soils surrounding the aforementioned mine wastes, are 39, 720 mg. kg - 1, 9030 mg. kg - 1 and 86 mg. kg - 1, respectively. Erosion by wind and running waters (heavy rain and flood periods) are considered as important mechanism in carrying these toxic elements to flood areas, and especially to soils lying on the eastern side of Jebel Hallouf Mountain. The statistical {{analyses of}} geochemical data relative to mine wastes and soils display a relationship between heavy metals and clay. Another relation is established between these metals and iron oxides. In soil, the µltivariate statistical approach [principal component analysis (PCA) ] has shown two contamination origins: the mining wastes and rock dumps (F 1 xF 2 diagram). Heavy metals concentrations in batch solutions of the contaminated soil samples varied between 36. 6 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 51. 2 51. 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Pb, 543 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 3600 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Zn and 0. 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 2. 5 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Cd, while for the flotation tailings the concentrations varied between 16. 9 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 483 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1, 63 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 3240 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1, and 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 9. 8 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for the same elements respectively.

The rhodamine fragment is pH-sensitive, and upon lowering of the pH, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed as the spirolactam ring opens to give the highly fluorescent form of the molecule. The ligands are bimodal when coordinated to Tb(III) ions, inducing fluorescence from both the lanthanide center and the rhodamine fluorophore, on two independent time frames. Confocal imaging experiments were carried out to establish the localization of <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2 in HEK 293 cells and primary mouse islet cells (∼ 70 % insulin-containing β cells).

Thus, high usage of <b>wash</b> <b>solution</b> may be mitigated. In this study, the effect of operating conditions such as electric potential difference, <b>wash</b> <b>solution</b> concentration and initial Pb concentration on the feasibility of washing-electrokinetic two stage process on Pb removal was investigated using response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design. The <b>wash</b> <b>solution</b> used was citric acid and three main aspects were examined, namely: (i) removal efficiency, (ii) effluent generated, and (iii) power consumption. The results revealed that the increase in electric potential difference and <b>wash</b> <b>solution</b> concentration generally enhanced Pb removal efficiency and the interactions of these parameters were significantly positive. However, undesirable high effluent generation and power consumption were also caused by these increments. Optimisation study revealed that 84. 14 % removal efficiency with zero effluent generation and a power consumption of 2. 27 kW h/kg Pb removed could be achieved at 7. 58 V and 0. 057 M citric acid concentration. In comparison with normal soil washing, washing-electrokinetic two stage process showed an enhancement in removal efficiency by approximate to 16 % via electromigration under optimum conditions using similar solution: soil ratio of < 0. 8 mL: 1 g soil.

Melaço de cana-de-açúcar foi o melhor substrato tanto para a produção de biomassa como de ficobiliproteinas. A maior produção de biomassa ocorreu usando melaço de cana-de-açúcar 1, 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 sendo 5, 7 vezes maior que o controle. Com glucose foi em 2, 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 e sacarose 1, 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1, sendo 2, 5 e 4, 8 vezes maior que o controle, respectivamente. A maior produção de ficobiliproteinas ocorreu usando melaço de cana-de-açúcar 1, 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 sendo 12, 5 vezes maior que o controle. Com glucose foi em 1, 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 e sacarose 0, 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1, 3, 0 e 4, 5 vezes maior que o controle, respectivamente. Nostoc sp. testado pode crescer mixotroficamente, usando glucose, sacarose e melaço de cana-deaçúcar como substratos orgânicos, uma maior produção de biomassa e ficobiliproteinas podendo ser alcançada nessas condições quando comparadas com o crescimento autotrófico. Glucose, sacarose, and {{sugarcane}} molasses {{were tested}} as substrates for production of biomass and phycobiliproteins by Nostoc sp., varying their concentrations {{in relation to}} a mineral medium, BG 11. All substrates increased the biomass and phycobiliproteins when compared with the control. Sugarcane molasses showed to be the best substrate for production of both biomass and phycobiliproteins. Greater biomass production occurred in sugarcane molasses 1. 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 and it was 5. 7 times greater than the control. With glucose, it was in 2. 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 and sucrose, in 1. 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1, reaching 2. 5 and 4. 8 times greater than the control, respectively. For phycobiliproteins, the major production was in sugarcane molasses 1. 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1, 12. 5 times greater than the control. With glucose, it was in 1. 0 g L- 1 and sucrose, in 0, 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1, reaching 3. 0 and 4. 5 times greater than the control, respectively. The Nostoc sp. assayed can grow mixotrophically, using glucose, sucrose, and sugarcane molasses as organic substrates, and a greater production of biomass and phycobiliproteins can be reached when compared with the autotrophic growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize the photodegradation ability of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) soil <b>washing</b> <b>solution.</b> After contaminated soil remediation by β-CD soil <b>washing</b> method, <b>solution</b> contained target contaminant was further treated with photodegradation technique. Degradation processes with Xe lamp to simulate natural sun light was investigated under different temperature, and various aeration rate. TiO 2 employed as photocatalyst was also tested in the soil washing system. The result demonstrated that photodegradation rate of PCP in soil <b>washing</b> <b>solution</b> was related to the aeration rate. The reaction could be slightly accelerated by increasing the temperature. TiO 2 adding will decrease the degradation speed, while using it together with H 2 O 2 will extremely increase the degradation rate of the target contaminant in this condition...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to asses the promotive effect of maltose, sucrose, proline, {{charcoal}} etc. on frequency of regeneration and embryogenesis. Factors affecting somatic embryogenesis and subsequent plant regeneration in vitro in basmati rice cultures were highly genotype specific. The number, mass and morphology of the callus formed on the scutellum were {{dependent on the}} medium used. They were affected by the auxins, sugars, amino acids, growth regulators etc. Supplementation of the control medium independently with maltose (30 and 60 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1), proline (560 m <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1), Elevated sucrose (60 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1), activated charcoal (2 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1), cefotaxime (100 mg L 1) enhanced somatic embryogenesis considerably. The nodular embryogenic calli were further confirmed through histological analysis and their plant regeneration ability. The plant regeneration was also influenced both by the genotype {{as well as the}} composition of the medium used for induction of plant regeneration. Higher plant regeneration was achieved on medium containing maltose (30 and 60 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1), proline (560 mg L 1), elevated sucrose (60 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1) and activated charcoal (2 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> 1). Plants obtained were phenotypically normal and identical to control seed derived plants and exhibited normal fertility. A limited humidity and an optimal aeration of the culture tubes enhanced the frequency of embryogenesis and plant regeneration...|$|R
