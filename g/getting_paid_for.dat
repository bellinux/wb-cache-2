The Illinois Bar Journal observed in 2009, [...] "The {{starting point for}} any discussion of <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> work in the private practice of law is retainer fees. In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates, Inc... the supreme court identified three types of lawyer retainer fees that are permissible in this state..." [...] and referred to the legal descriptions as [...] "Dowling fee classifications".|$|E
500|$|In 1933, Wolters {{returned}} to Berlin, where he briefly {{worked as an}} assistant in Speer's office {{before returning to the}} Reichsbahn, this time <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> his work. [...] Speer had forged a close relationship with Hitler, and in late 1936, Speer informed Wolters that the dictator would soon appoint Speer as [...] (GBI) or General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital, and suggested that Wolters resign his post with the railway and come work for him again. [...] Wolters did so, beginning work at the GBI office in January 1937 as a Head of Department in the Planning Bureau. [...] Wolters was {{one of a number of}} young, well-paid assistants of Speer at the GBI, who were collectively nicknamed [...] "Speer's Kindergarten". [...] Most of the Kindergarteners were not Nazi Party members, since Speer found that Party duties interfered with working time, and the Kindergarten was expected to work long hours. [...] Speer had Hitler's permission to hire non-Nazis, so the GBI became something of a political sanctuary.|$|E
500|$|The duo {{met again}} in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to {{complete}} the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone {{did not like the}} orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, [...] "Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> taking up space—around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.|$|E

500|$|Nine {{years after}} the fateful heist, Trevor finds out that Michael faked his death, and is so spooked and enraged that he breaks the truce and kills most of his {{competition}} in one burst of violence, a deadly streak that continues when a potential game-changing deal with the Triads falls through. He drives to Los Santos, taking over the apartment and ruining the life of Wade's cousin Floyd, and reunites with Michael, who now took on the name [...] "De Santa". After Michael introduces Trevor to Franklin Clinton, the two perform heists again, this time including Franklin. Trevor is determined to rob anything guarded by Merryweather Security Consulting, a private security firm that he dislikes, but he often fails. After not <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> a job, Trevor kidnaps Patricia, the wife of kingpin Martin Madrazo. Due to her kind maternal nature and his own abandonment issues, Trevor {{falls in love with}} her and only returns her after much demanding from Michael.

500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience." [...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first series of Life on Mars was extremely positive. Steve O'Brien, writing for SFX, declared, [...] "It looks like BBC One has... a monster hit on its hands... It's funny... and dramatic and exciting, and we're really not <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> saying this". Alison Graham, television editor for the Radio Times, described the series as [...] "a genuinely innovative and imaginative take on an old genre". James Walton of The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Theoretically, this should {{add up to a}} right old mess. In practice, it makes for a thumpingly enjoyable piece of television — not least because everybody involved was obviously having such a great time". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote: [...] "Life on Mars {{was more than just a}} jolly, tongue-in-cheek romp into the past... Once there, in 1973, we find ourselves immersed in a reasonably gripping police drama — yes, The Sweeney, perhaps, with better production values... Or put another — undeniably laboured — way, as poor Sam Tyler walks through his sunken dream, I'm hooked to the silver screen". Although Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail reflected the views of many other commentators on the first episode when he wondered, [...] "Can its intriguing conceit be sustained over eight one-hour episodes?", Critical reaction remained generally positive throughout the programme's run. Of the second series, Alison Graham believed that [...] "Sam Tyler and Gene Hunt are shaping up nicely as one of the great TV detective partnerships... It's vastly enjoyable and manages to stay just about believable thanks to some strong writing and, of course, the two marvellous central performances".|$|E

2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me {{that he was going to}} get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
