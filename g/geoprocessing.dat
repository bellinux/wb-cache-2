2500|$|ArcGIS 9 was {{released}} in May 2004, which included ArcGIS Server and ArcGIS Engine for developers. The ArcGIS 9 release includes a <b>geoprocessing</b> environment that allows execution of traditional GIS processing tools (such as clipping, overlay, and spatial analysis) interactively or from any scripting language that supports COM standards. [...] Although {{the most popular of}} these is Python, others have been used, especially Perl and VBScript. [...] ArcGIS 9 includes a visual programming environment, similar to ERDAS IMAGINE's Model Maker (released in 1994, v8.0.2). The Esri version is called ModelBuilder and as does the ERDAS IMAGINE version allows users to graphically link <b>geoprocessing</b> tools into new tools called models. [...] These models can be executed directly or exported to scripting languages which can then execute in batch mode (launched from a command line), or they can undergo further editing to add branching or looping.|$|E
2500|$|ArcGIS for Desktop {{consists}} of several integrated applications, including ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, ArcScene, ArcGlobe, and ArcGIS Pro. [...] ArcCatalog is the data management application, used to browse datasets and files on one's computer, database, or other sources. [...] In addition to showing what data is available, ArcCatalog also {{allows users to}} preview the data on a map. [...] ArcCatalog also provides the ability to view and manage metadata for spatial datasets. [...] ArcMap is the application used to view, edit and query geospatial data, and create maps. [...] The ArcMap interface has two main sections, including a table of contents {{on the left and}} the data frame(s) which display the map. [...] Items in the table of contents correspond with layers on the map. [...] ArcToolbox contains <b>geoprocessing,</b> data conversion, and analysis tools, along with much of the functionality in ArcInfo. [...] It is also possible to use batch processing with ArcToolbox, for frequently repeated tasks. ArcScene is an application which allows the user to view their GIS data in 3-D and is available with the 3D Analyst License. [...] In the layer properties of ArcScene there is an Extrusion function which allows the user to exaggerate features three dimension-ally. ArcGlobe is another one of ArcGIS's 3D visualization applications available with the 3D Analyst License. ArcGlobe is a 3D visualization application that allows you to view large amounts of GIS data on a globe surface. [...] The ArcGIS Pro application was added to ArcGIS for Desktop in 2015. It had the combined capabilities of the other integrated applications and was built as a fully 64-bit software application.|$|E
50|$|<b>Geoprocessing</b> is a GIS {{operation}} used {{to manipulate}} spatial data. A typical <b>geoprocessing</b> operation takes an input dataset, performs an operation on that dataset, and returns {{the result of}} the operation as an output dataset. Common <b>geoprocessing</b> operations include geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing, raster processing, and data conversion. <b>Geoprocessing</b> allows for definition, management, and analysis of information used to form decisions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Geoprocessing</b> {{is based}} on a {{framework}} of data transformation in GIS and is a collection of hundreds of GIS tools that manipulate geospatial or other data in GIS. A <b>geoprocessing</b> tool performs an operation (often the name of the tool, such as [...] "Clip") on an existing GIS dataset and produces a new dataset {{as a result of the}} utilized tool. GIS users utilize these tools to create a workflow model that quickly and easily transforms raw data into the desired product.|$|E

5000|$|Odyssey {{became the}} {{template}} for subsequent GIS software, cited as an inspiration by numerous commercial efforts in mapping and architecture, such as M&S Computing (later Intergraph), Computervision, and Geodat. [...] The Laboratory {{was an enormous}} influence on the commercial Environmental Systems Research Institute, Esri, founded in 1969 by Jack Dangermond, a landscape architect graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Design who {{had worked as a}} research assistant at the Laboratory during 1968 and 1969. Scott Morehouse, the development lead for the Odyssey project, worked at the lab from 1977 to 1981. When revenues from Odyssey did not meet expectations, his team's resources started to dwindle, and Morehouse left to join Jack at Esri to build a next-generation GIS platform that was to be ArcInfo. Scott's intimate knowledge of the Odyssey <b>geoprocessing</b> model and code base, combined with Jack's insights into how to put the 'IS' in 'GIS' evolved the Laboratory's GIS prototype processors into a system that could effectively and interactively manage, process, edit, and display vector geodata and its scalar attributes that addressed evolving market needs for more robust GIS capabilities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Geoprocessing</b> is {{commonly}} used in solving problems across disciplines which feature geospatial data and/or phenomena. <b>Geoprocessing</b> requires specialized algorithms and more recently, due to large volumes of geospatial databases and complex <b>geoprocessing</b> operations, it has become data- and/or compute-intensive. The conventional approach, which is predominately based on centralized computing solutions, is unable to handle <b>geoprocessing</b> efficiently. To that end, {{there is a need}} for developing distributed <b>geoprocessing</b> solutions by taking advantage of existing and emerging advanced techniques and high-performance computing and communications resources. As an emerging new computing paradigm, grid computing offers a novel approach for integrating distributed computing resources and supporting collaboration across networks, making it suitable for <b>geoprocessing.</b> Although there have been research efforts applying grid computing in the geospatial domain, there is currently a void in the literature for a general <b>geoprocessing</b> optimization. In this research, a new optimization technique for <b>geoprocessing</b> in grid systems, <b>Geoprocessing</b> Optimization in Grids (GOG), is designed and developed. The objective of GOG is to reduce overall response time with a reasonable cost. To meet this objective, GOG contains a set of algorithms, including a resource selection algorithm and a parallelism processing algorithm, to speed up query execution.
