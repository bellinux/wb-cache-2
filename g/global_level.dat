5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} has a large, {{currently}} unquantified range; its world population is also unknown, but includes an estimated 52–96 million individuals in Europe. Although population trends {{have not been}} evaluated, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species' conservation status is evaluated at the <b>global</b> <b>level</b> as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's first {{international}} appearance {{in his home}} country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4×200m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1min 47.67s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim's winning time in the 200m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, {{it was the first}} time that Australia had won the event at the <b>global</b> <b>level</b> since 1956. Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29s lead over Thorpe by the 300m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53s at the 350m mark, Hackett led until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe's time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion, aged 15 years and 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli took up {{swimming}} {{due to his}} asthma, {{and quickly}} came to prominence. Selected to represent Australia at the 1973 World Championships, he came sixth in the 200m backstroke {{at the age of}} 16. He won his first Australian titles in 1974 in the 100m backstroke and 200m butterfly and went on to the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he won his first major international race, the 100m backstroke, and took silver in the 200m backstroke. In 1975, Tonelli won his only individual medal at <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> a silver in the 200m backstroke at the World Championships in Cali, Colombia. In 1975, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama in the United States, studying and competing in the collegiate sport system. He was selected in both backstroke events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, but struggled and missed the medals in both events. During his stay in America, Tonelli set times that would have placed him among the world's leading swimmers, but he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaches of discipline.|$|E
