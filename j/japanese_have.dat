In response to crimes committed by U.S. servicemembers against Japanese citizens, such as the 1995 Okinawan rape incident, Japanese citizens and some Japanese government officials have questioned the equality of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the issue of responsibility and accountability by the U.S. government concerning the actions of its military members in Japan.

When Bond raises {{the purpose of}} his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> already penetrated the British information source and Bond has nothing left to bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing [...] "Garden of Death" [...] in an ancient castle; people flock there to commit suicide.

Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and think as a mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond [...] "Taro Todoroki" [...] for the mission.|$|E

500|$|The {{debate on}} the death toll {{has gone on for}} many decades to the point where some historians have begun to {{question}} its usefulness on the grounds that excessive quibbling over the precise death toll has distracted from the study of other more important facets of the massacre.

Numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities do not address this point."

500|$|In {{his book}} Gilligan Unbound, American {{literary}} critic Paul Cantor described how [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] references and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, {{where they have to}} re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. After Marge bails them out, Bart and Homer can speak fluent Japanese, and have fully absorbed, as Cantor writes, the [...] "exclusionary" [...] character of the Japanese culture, as Homer asks Bart (in Japanese, with English subtitles): [...] "Should we tell them [...] the secret to inner peace?", to which Bart replies (still in Japanese), [...] "No, they are foreign devils." [...] The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture, and is, according to Cantor, [...] "filled" [...] with signs of how eagerly <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> taken to American culture.

500|$|For the Australians, the Battle of Isurava has {{sometimes}} been described as [...] "Australia's Thermopylae". The battle has come to form {{a key part of}} the Anzac legend with Kingsbury's actions, as well as numerous other acts of bravery from both Japanese and Australian troops, being highlighted in various accounts of the fighting which have been characterised as part of an epic battle of national survival. In the early post-war years, the efforts of the Australian force in holding up the Japanese for a period of four days were seen as representing a significant feat of arms, fought against a greatly superior force on which the Australians inflicted heavy casualties in a tactically successfully action which delayed the Japanese and allowed the Australians time with which to bring up further reinforcements. While elements of this narrative continue to resonate, recently the magnitude of Japanese losses has been re-evaluated and this analysis has been called into question. As wider strategic goals of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> been re-cast, and the number of Japanese engaged in the battle has been found to be significantly less than the Australians had thought at the time, the performance of the Australian defenders, and the decisions of their commanders, have also been re-evaluated. Indeed, author Peter Williams, as part of his thesis about the myths of the Kokoda Track campaign, has described the battle as a [...] "defeat with few redeeming features", going on to state that [...] "Horii defeated Maroubra Force but failed to destroy it".|$|E
500|$|One {{significant}} {{achievement for}} the resistance in Visayas was {{the capture of}} the [...] "Koga Papers" [...] by Cebuano guerrillas led by Lt. Col. James M. Cushing in March 1944. Named after Admiral Mineichi Koga, these papers contained vital battle plans and defensive strategies of the Japanese Navy codenamed the [...] "Z Plan", information on the overall strength of the Japanese fleet and naval air units, and most importantly that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> already deduced MacArthur's initial plans to invade the Philippines through Mindanao. These papers came into the possession of the Filipino guerrillas when the seaplane of Admiral Koga, which was en route to Davao, crashed into the coast San Fernando, Cebu, killing Koga and many others. After Koga's body and many surviving Japanese were washed ashore, the guerrillas found them and captured 12 high-ranking officers including Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukodome. The papers were inside a briefcase which was fished {{out of the sea}} by Cebuano fishermen before being handed down to the guerrillas. The Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the documents and their captured officers; burning villages and detaining civilians in their search. The guerrillas were ultimately forced to release their captives in order to stop the aggression, but unknown to the Japanese Cushing managed to request for a submarine to take the documents to Allied headquarters in Australia. The discovery of the papers allowed MacArthur to move his invasion from Mindanao to Leyte and also aided the Allies in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|E
