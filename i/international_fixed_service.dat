40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for global wideband satellite communication services on vessels {{has led to}} applications that enable Earth Stations on board Vessels (ESVs) to use Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) networks operating in the uplink band 14 - 14. 5 GHz. The broadband communication solution requested from these kinds of vessels can only be provided by using the ESV services - today offered by several telecommunication operators. Transmitting capacity may vary between 19. 2 kbit/s up to 1 - 2 Mbit/s. From the International Radio Regulatory view, {{in accordance with the}} Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union, the 14 - 14. 5 GHz band is allocated to the Mobile-Satellite Service (Earth-to-Space), except to the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) on a secondary basis, to the <b>Fixed</b> Satellite <b>Service</b> (FSS) on a primary basis in all ITU regions and to the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Service</b> (FS) in many countries through Radio Regulations Article 5 footnotes. Hence, whichever operational frequency for the mobile earth station is chosen within 14 - 14. 5 GHz, there may be a need to consider the potential interference caused to the FS receivers. Particularly, in the case of mobile earth stations installed on vessels, interference problems may be created to the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Service</b> receivers placed near the coastline or on small islands. For countries like Greece, the problem is even more intense since there are many islands where <b>Fixed</b> <b>Service</b> links may be deployed and a great number of vessels equipped with Earth Stations operating in the 14 / 11 GHz band travel throughout Aegean Sea every day especially during summer. This paper examines the potential interference from earth stations on vessels to <b>Fixed</b> <b>Service</b> receivers in the 14 GHz band when the vessels are traveling close to the coastline. The parameters that {{have an impact on the}} interference calculations are presented and simulations are conducted for various realistic interference scenarios. It is shown that, the interference caused to the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Service</b> receivers is negligible if some operational limits are imposed to the vessels equipped with Earth Stations...|$|R
