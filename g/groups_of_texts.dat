2500|$|There are {{two major}} <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> in this Veda: the [...] "Black" [...] (Krishna) and the [...] "White" [...] (Shukla). The term [...] "black" [...] implies [...] "the un-arranged, motley collection" [...] of verses in Yajurveda, in {{contrast}} to the [...] "white" [...] (well arranged) Yajurveda. The White Yajurveda separates the Samhita from its Brahmana (the Shatapatha Brahmana), the Black Yajurveda intersperses the Samhita with Brahmana commentary. Of the Black Yajurveda, texts from four major schools have survived (Maitrayani, Katha, Kapisthala-Katha, Taittiriya), while of the White Yajurveda, two (Kanva and Madhyandina). The youngest layer of Yajurveda text is not related to rituals nor sacrifice, it includes the largest collection of primary Upanishads, influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy.|$|E

5000|$|Most of Hadewijch's extant {{writings}}, none {{of which}} survived the Middle Ages as an autograph, are in a Brabantian form of Middle Dutch. Five <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> survive: her writings include poetry, descriptions of her visions, and prose letters. There are two groups of poetry: Poems in Stanzas (Strophische Gedichten) and Poems in Couplets (Mengeldichten). Finally there is the [...] "Lijst der volmaakten" [...] ("list of the perfect ones").|$|E
40|$|English is {{lingua franca}} of today's society. The {{consequences}} of that fact are twofold. On one hand languages such as Croatian tend to restrict huge numbers of anglicisms and plain English words that are taken into Croatian, whilst {{on the other hand}} the media promotes English words daily. This paper analyses sixty Croatian texts taken from the internet to see if different sources influence the choice of English words. One <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> which discusses the divorce between Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, are based on English sources, hence are often direct translations. The other <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> originally written in Croatian, discusses the divorce between Josip Radeljak and Vlatka Pokos, Croatian ex-couple who could be described as celebrities. The analysis shows that the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> is influenced by English sources on syntax (such as usage of passive, personal pronouns, gerunds) and semantics (such as literate translations of idioms, false friends). They have somewhat more non-adapted English words than the second <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> Non-adapted English words in the first group were mostly connected to British culture and music, while the second <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> used non-adapted English words either with negative connotation or due to trendiness...|$|R

5000|$|It {{should be}} {{stressed}} {{that only the}} Ru, or Confucians and the Mohists were actual organized schools of teachers and disciples during this period. All the other schools were invented later to describe <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> that expressed similar ideas. There was never an organized group of people describing themselves as [...] "Legalists," [...] for example, and the term [...] "Daoist" [...] was only coined in the Eastern Han after having succeeded the Western Han's Huang-Lao movement.|$|E
5000|$|The Vaishnava Upanishad {{describes}} Vishnu as {{the highest}} being, above Samkhya principles, above Shiva, and above Brahma. This view competes with Shaiva Upanishads which describe Shiva {{as the highest}} being. Both <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> however, use reverential words of all Hindu gods, and assert them {{to be the same}} Atman-Brahman. The Upanishad presents a syncretism of Vaishnava and Vedanta ideas, and is notable for its teaching of [...] "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam", or [...] "the world is one family".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{originated}} from the discovery <b>of</b> a rich <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> published as an “answer” {{to the novel}} Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. After an introductory section offering {{a panoramic view of}} the great fortune of this Dickensian classic, my research deals with the main key issues regarding the debate around intertextuality. Afterwards it focuses on the definition of rewriting, necessary for the choice <b>of</b> a homogeneous <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> The novels that this thesis analyses were published between 1905 and 2006 and the choice of a comparative approach has brought to light the particular interpretation of the Dickensian novel given by these rewritings...|$|R

50|$|The {{poems that}} form this {{collection}} were written between 1936-39. A selection from {{them had been}} published in 1957 under the title Volverse sombra y otras poemas. In {{the first edition of}} his Poesías completas that his daughter Solita brought out in 1971, she restored the original title and gathered together 21 poems. In the 1981 edition, she added a further 26 poems, considerably expanding the size of the collection. The manuscript, which existed almost entirely in typescript, was made up of 5 distinct <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> 3 found in Gilman Hall at the Johns Hopkins campus and the other 2 amongst the poet's papers in his house in Newland Road, Baltimore. The state of the manuscripts varied between finished and properly typed up, finished by the poet but not properly typed up, and draft. Amongst the drafts, there were some that the editor felt were complete enough to merit publication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manuscript}} (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), {{which include}} a quire of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12 cm. The manuscript includes [...] "eighty-four different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> including hundreds of poems". The Biblical and liturgical texts include the Pentateuch, the Haftarot prophetical readings, Tiqqun soferim, Five Scrolls, and the full annual cycle of the liturgy, {{as well as the}} Haggadah (Passover ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the Book of Tobit, which is not included in the Tanakh or canon of the Hebrew Bible. [...] Other texts include the Pirkei Avot, prayers, gematria, legal texts and calendars. The poetry includes a large group of poems by Moses ibn Ezra, the great Spanish Sephardic poet of the previous century. The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as [...] "Benjamin", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no [...] "proper colophon" [...] as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript. [...] Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of Aaron indicate a patron with this name.The manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, [...] "which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops", and probably also worked on at Amiens or another north French city, and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that [...] "broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style".|$|E

In the final section I give a short illustrative example of how a CDA approach to detailed textual analysis might also be applied to specific texts (or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts)</b> in the political arena: in the example I take the press release in which the national UK government heralded its recent ‘empowerment’ White Paper, ‘Communities in Control’...|$|E
40|$|Hegel {{develops}} {{his theory}} of will simultaneously in two different contexts of his work: on one side, in the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, the corresponding Berlin lessons and in texts which {{can be considered as}} incipient versions of the Encyclopedia; on the other hand, in the Elements of the Philosophy of Right, the lessons based on them and in previous texts on the Philosophy of Right in which Hegel exposes {{his theory of}} subjective will.

40|$|International audienceCuneiform {{mathematical}} {{texts from}} the Old Babylonian (period early second millennium BCE) {{are the result}} of the activities of scribal schools and, in this sense, emanate incontestably from a “teaching context”. Mathematical texts are generally considered as evidence of pedagogical activity, meaning they are assumed to have been written either by students or for students. My goal is to show the simplistic nature of such a narrow alternative. Three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> are examined to show that an elementary school text was not always puerile; that a text written for teaching could at the same time serve other purposes and that a text written by a master did not always have an educative objective.
