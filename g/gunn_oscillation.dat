40|$|Gunn (or Gunn-Hilsum) Effect and its {{associated}} negative differential resistivity (NDR) emanates from transfer of electrons between two different energy bands in a semiconductor. If applying a voltage (electric field) transfers electrons from an energy sub band of a low effective mass to a second one with higher effective mass, then the current drops. This manifests itself as a negative slope or NDR in the I-V characteristics of the device which is in essence due to the reduction of electron mobility. Recalling that mobility is inversely proportional to electron effective mass or curvature of the energy sub band. This effect was observed in semiconductors like GaAs which has direct bandgap of very low effective mass and its second indirect sub band is about 300 meV above the former. More importantly a self-repeating oscillation of spatially accumulated charge carriers along the transport direction occurs which is the artifact of NDR, a process which is called <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillation</b> and was observed by J. B. Gunn. In sharp contrast to GaAs, bulk silicon has a very high energy spacing (~ 1 eV) which renders the initiation of transfer-induced NDR unobservable. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), semi-empirical 10 orbital ($sp^{ 3 }d^{ 5 }s^{*}$) Tight Binding (TB) method and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) simulations we show {{for the first time}} that (a) Gunn Effect can be induced in narrow silicon nanowires with diameters of 3. 1 nm under 3 % tensile strain and an electric field of 5000 V/cm, (b) the onset of NDR in I-V characteristics is reversibly adjustable by strain and (c) strain can modulate the value of resistivity by a factor 2. 3 for SiNWs of normal I-V characteristics i. e. those without NDR. These observations are promising for applications of SiNWs in electromechanical sensors and adjustable microwave oscillators. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, 63 reference...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations</b> in a GaN based planar nano-device {{have been}} studied by {{ensemble}} Monte Carlo (EMC) method. Si-mulation results show that when the channel length of the device reduces to 450 nm, THz oscillations (about 0. 3 THz) can be obtained. Also the phase of the oscillations can be controlled by the initial conditions that excite the Gunn do-mains. Moreover, through adjusting the phase difference between the oscillations in a double-channels device, which attained by parallel connecting two single-channel devices, {{the frequency of the}} device shifts from 0. 3 THz to 0. 6 THz. This phenomenon remains in devices with shorter channel-length, unless the channel-length is too short to support <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The possible underlying mechanisms are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Gallium nitride {{can offer}} a {{high-power}} alternative for millimeter-wave Gunn oscillators. Hence, an ensemble Monte Carlo-based comprehensive theoretical assessment of efficiency and harmonic enhancement in n-type GaN Gunn diodes is undertaken. First, the effects of doping notch/mesa and its position within the active channel are investigated which favors a doping notch positioned next to cathode. It is then observed that {{the width of the}} notch can be optimized to enhance the higher-harmonic operation without degrading its performance at the fundamental mode. Next, the effects of dc bias and channel doping density are investigated. Both of these have more significant effects on the higher-harmonic efficiency than the fundamental one. The lattice temperature is observed to have almost no influence up to room temperature but severely degrades the performance above room temperature. As a general behavior, the variations of temperature, channel doping, and the notch width primarily affect the phase angle between the current and voltage wave forms rather than the amplitude of oscillations. Finally, the physical origin of these <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations</b> is sought which clearly indicates that the intervalley scattering mechanism is responsible rather than the Γ valley nonparabolicity or the effective mass discrepancy between the Γ and the lowest satellite valleys. © 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{performances}} of a {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) based planar nanodevice are studied by a two-dimensional-three-dimensional (2 D- 3 D) combined model and an entirely 2 D model. In both models, 2 DEGs are depicted by 2 D ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) method. However electric field distributions in the devices are obtained by self-consistently solving 2 D and 3 D Poisson equations for the 2 D model and the 2 D- 3 D model, respectively. Simulation results obtained by both models are almost the same at low bias while showing distinguished differences at high bias. The 2 D model predicts larger output current and slightly higher threshold voltage of <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Although the fundamental frequencies of current oscillations obtained by both models are similar, the deviation of wave shape from sinusoidal waveform obtained by the 2 D model is more serious than that obtained by 2 D- 3 D model. Moreover, results obtained by the 2 D model are more sensitive both to the bias conditions and to the change of device parameters. Interestingly, a look-like second harmonic oscillation has been observed at DC bias. We contribute the origin of divergences in simulation results to the different coupling path of electric field in the two models. And the second-harmonic oscillations at DC bias should {{be the result of}} the appearance of concomitant oscillations beside the channel excited by strong electric-field effects...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) method {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} {{computational}} electronics related to the simulation {{of the state of the}} art devices. Using this technique our specific intention is to scrutinize the high-field transport phenomena in wide bandgap semiconductors (Such as GaN, AlGaN and AlN). For this purpose, we have developed an EMC-based computer code. After a brief introduction to our methodology, we present detailed analysis of three different types of devices, operating under high-field conditions, namely, unipolar n-type structures, avalanche photodiodes (APD) and finally the Gunn diodes. As a testbed for understanding impact ionization and hot electron effects in sub-micron sized GaN, AlN and their ternary alloys, an n +−n−n + channel device is employed having a 0. 1 µm-thick n region. The time evolution of the electron density along the device is seen to display oscillations in the unintentionally doped n-region, until steady state is established. The fermionic degeneracy effects are observed to be operational especially at high fields within the anode n +-region. For AlxGa 1 −xNbased systems, it can be noted that due to alloy scattering, carriers cannot acquire the velocities attained by the GaN and AlN counterparts. Next, multiplication and temporal response characteristics under a picosecond pulsed optical illumination of p +-n-n + GaN and n-type Schottky Al 0. 4 Ga 0. 6 N APDs are analyzed. For the GaN APD, our simulations can reasonably reproduce the available measured data without any fitting parameters. In the case of AlGaN, the choice of a Schottky contact APD is seen to improve drastically the field confinement resulting in satisfactory gain characteristics. Moreover, alloy scattering is seen to further slow down the temporal response while displacing the gain threshold to higher fields. Finally, the dynamics of large-amplitude <b>Gunn</b> domain <b>oscillations</b> from 120 GHz to 650 GHz are studied in detail by means of extensive EMC simulations. The basic operation is checked under both impressed single-tone sinusoidal bias and external tank circuit conditions. The width of the doping-notch is observed to enhance higher harmonic efficiency at the expense of the fundamental frequency up to a critical value, beyond which sustained <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations</b> are ceased. The degeneracy effects due to the Pauli Exclusion principle and the impact ionization are also considered but observed to have negligible effect within the realistic operational bounds.

40|$|In a {{semiconductor}} superlattice {{with long}} scattering times, damping of Bloch oscillations due to scattering {{is so small}} that nonlinearities may compensate it and Bloch oscillations persist even in the hydrodynamic regime. To demonstrate this, a Boltzmann-Poisson transport model of miniband superlattices with inelastic collisions is proposed and hydrodynamic equations for electron density, electric field and the complex amplitude of the Bloch oscillations are derived by singular perturbation methods. For appropriate parameter ranges, numerical solutions of these equations show stable Bloch oscillations with spatially inhomogeneous field, charge, current density and energy density profiles. These Bloch oscillations disappear as scattering times become sufficiently short. For sufficiently low lattice temperatures, Bloch and <b>Gunn</b> type <b>oscillations</b> mediated by electric field, current and energy domains coexist {{for a range of}} voltages. For larger lattice temperatures (300 K), there are only Bloch oscillations with stationary amplitude and electric field profiles. Comment: 42 pages, 4 figures, to appear in PR...|$|R
40|$|EN]In recent years, the {{development}} of GaN technology has made significant inroads intohigh-power and high-frequency applications with respect to other semiconductorcompetitors such as GaAs or InP. In this dissertation, {{by means of an}} in-house Monte Carlo tool, we study the possibilityof generating <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillations</b> through vertical n+nn+ (without notch) and n+n-nn+(notched) diodes based on InP and GaN with different lengths of the active region andtwo doping profiles. In general, when the notch accomplishes its role of fixing the onsetof charge accumulation near the cathode, the oscillations are of lower frequency andpower. For InP-based diodes, the fundamental frequency reaches 140 GHz (notched,L= 1. 2 μm) and 400 GHz (without notch, L= 0. 75 μm). For the GaN-based diode with anactive length L= 1. 5 μm, {{despite the fact that the}} fundamental harmonic is around 100 GHz, the power spectral density for the 10 th harmonic (1 THz) is still significant. InPdiodes with L= 0. 9 μm offer an efficiency (η) of up to 5. 5 % for frequencies around 225 GHz. The generation bands in GaN diodes appear at higher frequencies (up to 675 GHz with η= 0. 1 %) than in InP. When circuits work at high powers, thermal models become essential to determinetemperature limits with a view to preventing device failure, thus reducing manufacturingcosts. In order to include thermal effects in our Monte Carlo code, two techniques havebeen implemented: (i) a thermal resistance method (TRM), and (ii) an advanced electrothermalmodel that solves the steady-state heat diffusion equation, called HDEM. Wecalibrate/validate our simulator by comparison with experimental measurements of anAlGaN/GaN diode. For the TRM, several thermal resistance values are employed, and forthe HDEM different substrates (polycrystalline diamond, diamond, carbide silicon, siliconand sapphire), thicknesses and die lengths are tested. In addition, we include the effectof thermal boundary resistance. Using temperature-independent thermal conductivityin the HDEM allows us to extract an equivalent thermal resistance, Rth, for each geometryand substrate material. The extracted Rth values are constant with the dissipated power,Pdiss. However, when a more real temperature-dependent thermal conductivity isemployed, Rth exhibits a strong dependence on Pdiss. As final test device, we analyse foran HEMT, the effect of (i) the heat-sink temperature and (ii) gate-length, through electrothermalsimulations...|$|R
