50|$|In March 1961, the {{importance}} of MCLB Barstow increased dramatically {{with the establishment of}} the Depot Maintenance Activity. In November 1978, the base was redesignated to its present title of Marine Corps Logistics Base to emphasize its broad <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> mission. In the early 1980s, MCLB Albany and Headquarters Marine Corps worked aggressively to <b>integrate</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> for the Fleet Marine Force and eliminate duplications. As a result, all operational logistics functions moved to Albany and in January 1990, the Commanding General, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, was redesignated Commander Marine Corps Logistics Bases. The command was redesignated again in 2003 {{as a result of the}} merging of Material Command MATCOM and Marine Corps Logistics Bases to form Marine Corps Logistics Command (MARCORLOGCOM). In late 2005, MCLB Barstow started a transition from military police to civilian police to free Marines for deployment; the Provost Marshal Office, military police, was augmented with a civilian Marine Corps Police Department, while many of the Marine Military Police stationed aboard the base have transferred to other commands. The transition from a Provost Marshal Office to a Marine Corps Police Department ended in 2007. As of late 2007, the department became the first police department in the Marine Corps to consist of all civilian officers. In 2010, the department became a blended force again with military police.|$|R

2500|$|Configuration Management {{originated}} in the United States Department of Defense in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and {{it is now a}} standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of military standards called the [...] "480 series" [...] (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the [...] "480 series" [...] was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry technical standards supported by standards developing organizations (SDO). This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, ANSI–EIA–649–1998. Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include systems engineering (SE), <b>integrated</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> (ILS), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 9000, Prince2 project management method, COBIT, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), product lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management. [...] Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.|$|E

Factors such as the used-product return ratio and corresponding subsidies from governmental organizations for reverse logistics are considered in the model formulation.
