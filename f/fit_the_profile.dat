5|$|The Kepler team's {{scientists}} conducted follow-up {{observations to}} confirm or reject the planetary nature of the detected object. To do so, they used the Keck 1 telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii; the Shane and Hale telescopes in California; telescopes at the WIYN (including MMT) and Whipple observatories in Arizona; Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands; the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopes in Texas; and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Because Kepler-11g orbits its star at a far greater distance than the inner five planets, fewer transits were observed, and radial velocity (the observation of a Doppler effect) interactions could not be easily discerned. As {{with the discovery of}} Kepler-9d, the Kepler team ran the information through numerous models to see if Kepler-11g's light curve could <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> of some other object, including an eclipsing binary star in the background that may have contaminated the data. The probability that Kepler-11g is not a planet but instead a false positive was determined to be 0.18%, effectively confirming its existence.|$|E

As with the 15th Party Congress five years earlier, the elder Bo lobbied for his son's promotion. The Bo family enjoyed the patronage of Jiang Zemin. However, Bo Xilai's unequivocal support for Jiang strengthened the reluctance of his political opponents to support his nomination. Ultimately, although Bo remained a top contender for higher promotion, Xi and Li remained the main candidates to succeed Hu Jintao as Paramount leader.|$|E

2500|$|Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised {{for being}} too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to {{indicate}} a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation {{used it as a}} point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> of the sender of the tape or letters. The [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact the hoaxer had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.|$|E
2500|$|Historian {{and head}} of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences Ziya Bunyadov, whom Thomas de Waal calls [...] "Azerbaijan's {{foremost}} Armenophobe", claimed that the massacre had been instigated by the Armenians to cast a negative light upon Azerbaijan. In an article that appeared in the Azerbaijani journal Elm, Bunyadov claimed that Armenians had organized the pogroms: [...] "The Sumgait tragedy was carefully prepared by Armenian nationalists...Several hours after it began, Armenian photographers and TV journalists secretly entered the city where they awaited in readiness." [...] Bunyadov's thesis was hinged on the fact that Sumgait Armenians had withdrawn more than one million rubles from their savings before the attacks. To support his thesis, he had also drawn {{attention to the fact that}} one of the participants in the riots and killings was Eduard Grigorian, a man of mixed Russian-Armenian lineage who had three previous criminal convictions and pretended to be Azerbaijani. Grigorian was a factory worker who took part in gang rapes and mass attacks and was subsequently sentenced to 12 years for his role in the massacres. Grigorian had been brought up in Sumgait by his Russian mother following the early death of his Armenian father, and his ethnic identity is considered irrelevant since he appropriately <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> of a [...] "pogromshchik, a thuggish young man, of indeterminate nationality with a criminal past, seeking violence for its own sake."

40|$|We <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> surface-brightness <b>profiles</b> of 21 {{elliptical}} galaxies {{using both}} the Sersic function {{and a new}} empirical model which combines an inner power law with an outer Sersic function. <b>The</b> <b>profiles</b> are combinations of deconvolved HST <b>profiles</b> from <b>the</b> literature and ellipse <b>fits</b> to <b>the</b> full WFPC 2 mosaic images, and thus span a radial range from ~ 0. 02 arcsec to ~ twice the half-light radius.

In doing so, we demonstrate that most, if not all, so-called ``power-law'' galaxies are better described as ``Sersic galaxies'' [...] they are well modeled by <b>the</b> three-parameter Sersic <b>profile</b> into <b>the</b> limits of HST resolution [...] and that ``core'' galaxies are best understood as consisting of an outer Sersic profile with an inner power-law cusp, which is a downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of <b>the</b> Sersic <b>profile.</b> This definition of cores resolves ambiguities that result when the popular ``Nuker law'' is <b>fitted</b> to <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> of ellipticals and bulges, particularly at lower luminosities.
