40|$|Although {{everyday}} life is often <b>demanding,</b> {{it remains unclear}} how <b>demanding</b> conditions impact self-regulation. Some theories suggest that <b>demanding</b> conditions impair self-regulation, by undermining autonomy, interfering with skilled performance and working memory, and depleting energy resources. Other theories, however, suggest that <b>demanding</b> conditions improve self-regulation by mobilizing super-ordinate control processes. The present article integrates both kinds of theories by proposing that the self-regulatory impact of <b>demanding</b> conditions depends on how people adapt to such conditions. When people are action-oriented, <b>demanding</b> conditions may lead to improved self-regulation. When people are state-oriented, <b>demanding</b> conditions may lead to impaired self-regulation.

5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the <b>demand</b> for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of <b>demand).</b> With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the <b>demand</b> for fuel. This increase in <b>demand</b> is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in <b>demand</b> from the increased efficiency.

This evolution of taste and <b>demand</b> for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The <b>demand</b> for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the <b>demand</b> for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high <b>demand</b> for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the <b>demand</b> for sugar.|$|E

The impact of <b>demanding</b> conditions on self-regulation is thus not fixed, but modifiable by psychological processes. <b>Demanding</b> conditions are pervasive in {{everyday life}}. At the workplace, employees need to stay abreast of rapid technological innovations and deal with constant pressures towards increased efficiency and productivity. In educational settings, students must meet high standards of academic excellence, often while performing low-paying jobs to cover high tuitions and while {{taking care of their}} family members. Even among friends, there are always emails to be responded to, birthdays to be remembered, meetings to be arranged, favors to be returned, along with countless other duties and obligations. Given that <b>demanding</b> conditions are exceedingly common, {{it is important to understand}} how people can most effectively deal with such conditions. Unfortunately, psychological theories offer seemingly contradictory insights into this matter. Some influential theories propose that <b>demanding</b> conditions are likely to undermine self-regulation (Baumeister & Showers, 1986; Beilock, Kulp, Holt, & Carr, 2004; Deci & Ryan, 2000; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). However, other theories suggest that <b>demanding</b> conditions lead people to marshal their self-regulatory resources, resulting in enhanced motivation and self-regulation (e. g., Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001; Brehm & Self, 1989; Trope & Fishbach, 2000). These different theories have very different practical implications. If <b>demanding</b> conditions undermine self-regulation, people will be best off by avoiding <b>demanding</b> conditions. By contrast, if <b>demanding</b> conditions facilitate self-regulation, people may be advised to seek out <b>demanding</b> conditions whenever they can. In the present article, we develop an integrative theoretical analysis of how <b>demanding</b> conditions influence self-regulation. In what follows, we begin by taking a closer look at the basic ways in which <b>demanding</b> conditions might help or hurt self-regulation. Next, drawing upon action control theory (Kuhl, 1984, 1994 a), we propose that the self-regulatory impact of <b>demanding</b> conditions depends on people’s mode of adapting to these conditions. When people are action-oriented, <b>demanding</b> conditions are likely to facilitate self-regulation. When people are state-oriented, <b>demanding</b> conditions are likely to impair self-regulation. We then review evidence that action versus state orientation moderates the impact of <b>demands</b> on self-regulation. Finally, we state our main conclusions and consider avenues for future research...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} three-wave {{study was}} to examine (i) reciprocal associations among job <b>demands,</b> work-related perseverative cognition (PC), and sleep quality; (ii) PC as a mediator in-between job <b>demands</b> and sleep quality; and (iii) continuous high job <b>demands</b> in relation to sleep quality and work-related PC over time. METHOD: A representative sample of the Swedish working population was approached in 2010, 2012, and 2014, and 2316 respondents were included in this longitudinal full-panel survey study. Structural equation modelling was performed to analyse the temporal relations between job <b>demands,</b> work-related PC, and sleep quality. Additionally, a subsample (N =  1149) consisting of individuals who reported the same level of exposure to job <b>demands</b> during all three waves (i. e. stable high, stable moderate, or stable low job <b>demands)</b> was examined in relation to PC and sleep quality over time. RESULTS: Analyses showed that job <b>demands,</b> PC, and poor sleep quality were positively and reciprocally related. Work-related PC mediated the normal and reversed, direct across-wave relations between job <b>demands</b> and sleep quality. Individuals with continuous high job <b>demands</b> reported significantly lower sleep quality and higher work-related PC, compared to individuals with continuous moderate/low job <b>demands.</b> CONCLUSION: This study substantiated reciprocal relations between job <b>demands,</b> work-related PC, and sleep quality and supported work-related PC as an underlying mechanism of the reciprocal job demands-sleep relationship.
