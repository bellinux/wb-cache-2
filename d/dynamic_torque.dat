For example, if a machine is running at a relatively low rpm (5-50 depending upon size) then <b>dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> is not a consideration since the static torque rating of the coupling will come closest to where the application is running. However, if a machine is running at 3,000rpm and the same full torque is required the result {{will not be the}} same because of the difference between static and dynamic torques.

40|$|This {{project is}} a kind of doingmovingthinking: a close study of iconic American dancer/choreographer Deborah Hays choreography and {{practice}} through my particular dancing experience of her solo At Once. The resulting experiential poetics illuminates both the implicit critique of an instrumental/rational paradigm and also the ethical implications of the particular relationality enacted in Hays work. I characterize Hays work as a radical communication practice, one that moves language through the body in a <b>dynamic</b> <b>torqueing</b> process that both gathers toward and unravels from the edges of meaningfulness in a process of perception. I work at the interdisciplinary intersection of dance, performance, somatics and cultural studies, and my thinking draws substantially on Maurice Merleau-Pontys phenomenological philosophy and language. Aspiring to a balanced integration of moving and writing, of practice and theory, I follow a performance studies approach, attempting, as characterized by performance scholar Dwight Conquergood: to live betwixt and between theory and theatricality, paradigms and practices, critical reflection and creative accomplishment (318). Through personal daily practice and performance of Hays work allied with close description, I apply my devised method of emergent choreographic analysis to Hays choreography and practice. This analysis, conducted from inside the practice of the work, reveals how Hays complex and distinctly linguistic choreography operates as a constructed situation for the practice of perception and that, in performance, this practice moves language through the body in a <b>dynamic</b> <b>torqueing</b> process that engenders a unique lived experience of paradoxical simultaneity. I coin the term somatic anacrusis to articulate this underlying processual phenomenon. Reconsidering the dimension of relationality in Hays work, I re-frame somatic anacrusis as a pre-relational pre-disposing, a kind of suspended or unconsummated relationality. Feminist philosopher Luce Irigarays thinking helps illuminate the ethical implications of Hays work as a practice of perception that opens a new way toward the other. I conclude by appropriating Hays own rhetorical interrogative strategy what if? What if somatic anacrusis offers a possible answer to Irigarays call for a new way to approach the other that respects fundamental difference and yet allows encounter...|$|R

40|$|Butterfly valves are {{versatile}} components {{widely used}} in hydraulic systems as shutoff and throttling valves. Butterfly valve components {{must be able to}} withstand the forces and torques that are generated with use. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> data are usually obtained in a test lab for a variety of steady state flow conditions; however the <b>dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> under transient (unsteady flow) conditions may be significantly different than that found in the laboratory. If a valve is closed too fast, especially in long systems, large transient pressures are generated and travel as waves through the pipeline. These transient waves increase the pressure difference across the valve, which in turn increases the <b>dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> that is applied to the valve. The effects of the increased <b>dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> are more significant in larger butterfly valves since <b>dynamic</b> <b>torque</b> {{is a function of the}} diameter raised to the third power.

Whereas ei constrains the <b>dynamic</b> <b>torques</b> involved in angular rotation, CM constrains the static torque necessary to keep the limb aloft in the gravitational field. Hence, possible effects of ei and CM on kinesthetic judgments must be related to the <b>dynamic</b> and static <b>torques,</b> respectively, involved in moving and positioning a limb. In the first experiment, blindfolded participants matched, with upper arms supported, the orientation of their forearms while the forearms’ ei and CM were manipulated relative to the elbow.
