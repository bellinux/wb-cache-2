500|$|The Israeli Army {{introduced}} a new round known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile. Using a semi-active laser <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be selected to either attack from the top (to defeat enemy armor) or direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters). Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both [...] and 120mm tank guns. The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users. Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage. Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate body armor.|$|E

50|$|Development of ASTOR was {{completed}} in 1960 and it entered service in 1963. Approximately 600 torpedoes were built by 1976, when the torpedo {{was replaced by the}} Mark 48 torpedo. The ASTORs were collected, fitted with conventional warheads and wake <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> systems, then sold to foreign navies as the Mark 45 Mod 1 Freedom Torpedo.|$|E
5000|$|The 9K32 Strela-2 (Cтрела, [...] "arrow"; NATO {{reporting}} name SA-7 Grail) is a man-portable, shoulder-fired, low-altitude {{surface-to-air missile}} system (MANPADS) {{with a high}} explosive warhead and passive infrared <b>homing</b> <b>guidance.</b> Broadly comparable in performance with the US Army FIM-43 Redeye, {{it was the first}} generation of Soviet man-portable SAMs, entering service in 1968, with series production starting in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|As for guidance, {{the basic}} version {{combines}} {{data from a}} Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and an inertial navigation system (INS) unit through Kalman filtering, achieving a 10 m circular error probability (CEP).

50|$|MASURCA {{utilised}} semi-active radar <b>homing</b> for terminal <b>guidance</b> requiring radar illumination of {{the target}} by its parent warship. This was provided by two groups of DRBR-51 tracking and illumination radars, allowing MASURCA equipped ships to simultaneously engage two targets.|$|R

50|$|The maneuverable {{reentry vehicle}} (abbreviated MARV or MaRV) {{is a type}} of {{ballistic}} missile whose warhead is capable of autonomous tracking ground targets. It often requires some terminal active <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> (like Pershing II active radar homing) to make sure the missile does not miss the target, because of the frequent trajectory shifts. Refer to atmospheric reentry.|$|E
50|$|The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American medium-range surface-to-air missile. It was {{designed}} to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave semi-active radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The Type 91 {{surface-to-air missile}} (91-shiki Keitai Chitaikū Yūdōdan) is a Japanese man-portable surface-to-air missile system. Its {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the US-made FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missile. It was created in order to replace its stock of American-made Stinger MANPADS, since the Type 91 has a better guidance system, which consist of both light and infrared system options. The Stinger, on the other hand, uses a passive infrared <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Except for new {{technologies}} in the guidance and seeker sections, {{which included a}} Global Positioning System receiver, a Walleye optical guidance system, and a newly developed Maverick missile datalink, all of the missile hardware came directly from the Harpoon missile. The SLAM is also equipped with a Tomahawk missile warhead for better destructive force. SLAM missile uses an inertial navigation system, which is supplemented by Global Positioning System (GPS) input, and it also uses Infrared <b>homing</b> terminal <b>guidance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A new sensor based <b>homing</b> {{integrated}} <b>guidance</b> {{and control}} law {{is presented to}} drive an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) towards a fixed target, in the horizontal plane, using the information provided by an Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) positioning system. Almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) is achieved, both {{in the absence of}} external disturbances and in the presence of constant known ocean currents. Simulations are presented to illustrate the performance and behavior of the overall closed loop system...|$|R
50|$|The basic version {{features}} a 250 kg bomb plus hybrid {{inertial navigation system}} (INS) / Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance. Other variants add infrared <b>homing</b> or laser <b>guidance</b> to increase accuracy; there are also versions with 125 kg, 500 kg or 1000 kg bomb bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{progress}} {{made in the}} development of the Yu-3 torpedo had encouraged the Chinese to resume the development of the Yu-4 torpedo after several years of dormancy which begun in the early 1960s. At the end of 1971, 5 samples were produced based on the experience gained {{in the development of}} the Yu-3 torpedo. However, the speed was low and other results were not satisfactory either. The Chinese researchers decided to take a prudent approach by developing two different versions, one with passive acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> and the other with combined passive / active acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance.</b> The one with passive acoustic homing begun its development in the mid-1960s and was named as Yu-4 Jia (鱼-4甲), or sometimes as Yu-4A, while the combined active / passive acoustic homing version begun its development in the late-1960s and named as Yu-4 Yi (鱼-4乙) or sometimes as Yu-4B. Yu-4A was designed by the East Wind Instrumentation Factory (东风仪表厂) in Xi'an, while Y-4B was designed jointly by Northwestern Polytechnical University (primary contractor) and Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) in Houma, Shanxi. Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) was tasked with manufacturing both Yu-4A and Y-4B.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller missiles, {{especially}} MANPADs, generally use infrared <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> systems. These {{have the}} advantage of being [...] "fire-and-forget", once launched they will home on the target on their own with no external signals needed. In comparison, SARH systems require the tracking radar to illuminate the target, which may require them to be exposed through the attack. Systems combining an infrared seeker as a terminal guidance system on a missile using SARH are also known, like the MIM-46 Mauler, but these are generally rare.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{upgrades}} included the incorporation of infrared <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> {{so that there is}} a dual guidance system {{similar to that of the}} Taiwanese Hsiung Feng II missile. Imaging infrared seeker and a television seeker similar to that of the C-701 anti-ship missile became available later. The imaging infrared seeker is reportedly derived from the imaging infrared seeker technology developed for Chinese air-to-air missiles. These three seekers are interchangeable with the original radar seeker, and can be fitted at naval bases rather than the factory.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to maneuvering target tracking using the Sliding Mode Observer theory, {{in the specific context}} of <b>homing</b> missile <b>guidance,</b> is developed. This scheme requires a priori information about the target acceleration bounds alone, and {{there is no need for}} a dynamic model to represent the target maneuver dynamics. The proposed estimator is as simple to implement as the conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) itself. The simulation results, in the presence of realistic noise sources, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed estimation scheme over the EKF...|$|R
50|$|Indium {{antimonide}} (InSb) is a crystalline compound {{made from}} the elements indium (In) and antimony (Sb). It is a narrow-gap semiconductor material from the III-V group used in infrared detectors, including thermal imaging cameras, FLIR systems, infrared <b>homing</b> missile <b>guidance</b> systems, and in infrared astronomy. The indium antimonide detectors are sensitive between 1-5 µm wavelengths.Indium antimonide was a very common detector in the old, single-detector mechanically scanned thermal imaging systems. Another application is as a terahertz radiation source {{as it is a}} strong photo-Dember emitter.|$|R
50|$|Land-attack {{missiles}} are usually programmed before launch {{to follow a}} set of waypoints up to the target. Terminal guidance {{can be done with}} active radar homing, passive radar or Electronic warfare support measures, infrared <b>homing</b> or optical <b>guidance,</b> or the (fixed) target was predesignated with as final waypoint.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very common}} area of ELINT is intercepting radars and {{learning}} their locations and operating procedures. Attacking forces {{may be able}} to avoid the coverage of certain radars, or, knowing their characteristics, electronic warfare units may jam radars or send them deceptive signals. Confusing a radar electronically is called a [...] "soft kill", but military units will also send specialized missiles at radars, or bomb them, to get a [...] "hard kill". Some modern air-to-air missiles also have radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> systems, particularly for use against large airborne radars.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{production}} of the newly built Yu-1 torpedoes has stopped long time ago, production continues in the form of upgrading the existing Yu-1 torpedoes in Chinese inventory, which numbered near 10,000. Yu-1 torpedoes have been modified in various stages, including incorporating ASW capability, so that the torpedo could no longer only be used for ASuW, but instead, can be used for both ASuW and ASW warfare. Another important modification was to incorporate Yu-1 torpedo as part of the CAPTOR mine type mine system. Upgrades with newer electronics had also been done. Incorporating active acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> was another upgrade.|$|E
50|$|In flight tests, the Kipper cruised on its {{approach}} to a target {{at an altitude of}} about 10,000 meters, using inertial guidance until it reaches a range of about 100 to 110 kilometers from the target, where it enters a shallow 15 degree dive, commanded by a mid-course update via radio link. When it reaches a range of 60 to 70 kilometers it levels out at an altitude of between 800 and 1,000 meters where it cruises until it reaches a range of 10 to 16 kilometers, when the missile's active radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> is engaged. It then enters a dive, striking the target vessel close to or below the waterline.|$|E
50|$|Bombe Guidée Laser (BGL) laser-guided {{bombs were}} {{developed}} by Matra (now MBDA) starting in 1978. The guidance system had to work using the same principles as the US Paveway guided bombs. The guidance kits were intended as modifications to existing free fall bombs that were in service with the French Air Force. The semi active laser <b>homing</b> (SALH) <b>guidance</b> system was developed starting from the AS-30 laser-guided missile sensor. The guidance system allowed for in-flight target illumination by the aircraft-mounted ATLIS 2 (Automatic Tracking Laser Illumination System) or with ground-based laser designator targeting pod.|$|R
50|$|The P-500 Bazalt has a 550 km {{range and}} a payload of 1,000 kg, which {{allows it to}} carry a 350 kt nuclear or a 950 kg semi-armor-piercing high-explosive warhead. The P-500 Bazalt uses active radar <b>homing</b> for {{terminal}} <b>guidance,</b> and can receive mid-course correction from the Tupolev Tu-95RTs Bear D, the Kamov Ka-25K Hormone B and the Kamov Ka-31.|$|R
50|$|Many early air-to-air and surface-to-air {{missiles}} had very simple infrared <b>homing</b> ("heat seeking") <b>guidance</b> systems {{with a narrow}} field of view. These missiles could be avoided by simply turning sharply, which essentially caused the missile {{to lose sight of}} the target aircraft. Another tactic was to exploit a missile's limited range by performing evasive maneuvers until the missiles had run out of fuel.|$|R
