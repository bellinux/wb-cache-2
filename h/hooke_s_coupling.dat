40|$|Spin {{motive force}} {{induced by the}} Rashba {{interaction}} {{in the presence of}} strong sd interaction between conduction electron and localized spin is theoretically studied. The motive force is calculated by evaluating the time-derivative of the current density on the basis of microscopic formalism. It is shown that there are two motive forces, one proportional to ×, the other, perpendicular component, proportional to ×(×), where and are the Rashba electric field and localized spin direction, respectively. The second type arises in the strong <b>sd</b> <b>coupling</b> regime from the spin relaxation. The appearance of perpendicular component from the spin relaxation is understood from the analogy with the current-induced torques. In the case of domain wall motion, the two contributions to the spin motive force are the same order of magnitude, while the first term dominates in the case of precession of uniform magnetization. Our result explains appearance of the perpendicular component in the weak <b>sd</b> <b>coupling</b> limit, recently discussed in the context of spin damping monopole.

40|$|A thrust stand {{calibration}} {{technique for}} use in testing repetitively-pulsed electric thrusters for in-space propulsion has been developed and tested using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand. In the implementation of this technique, current pulses are applied to a solenoidal coil to produce a pulsed magnetic field that acts against the magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet mounted to the thrust stand pendulum arm. The force on the magnet is applied in this non-contact manner, with the entire pulsed force transferred to the pendulum arm through a piezoelectric force transducer to provide a time-accurate force measurement. Modeling of the pendulum arm dynamics reveals that after an initial transient in thrust stand motion the quasisteady average deflection of the thrust stand arm away from the unforced or zero position {{can be related to}} the average applied force through a simple linear <b>Hooke</b> <b>s</b> law relationship. Modeling demonstrates that this technique is universally applicable except when the pulsing period is increased {{to the point where it}} approaches the period of natural thrust stand motion. Calibration data were obtained using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand previously used for steady-state thrust measurements. Data were obtained for varying impulse bit at constant pulse frequency and for varying pulse frequency. The two data sets exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with each other as the constant relating average deflection and average thrust match within the errors on the linear regression curve fit of the data. Quantitatively, the error on the calibration coefficient is roughly 1 % of the coefficient value...|$|R

In {{the era of}} globalization and increased mobility of individuals who pursue various goals in their immigration, immigration due to marriage becomes a new norm. As the number of transnational marriages increases, including those from Eastern Europe, {{it is important for}} social scientists to focus on these types of marriage circumstances, and for family practitioners to better understand how marriage migrants adjust within their marriage and community. The two research questions of the dissertation include the following: What are the characteristics of spouses in transnational EE-U. <b>S.</b> <b>couples</b> that can distinguish them from spouses in intranational U. <b>S.</b> -U. <b>S.</b> <b>couples?</b> (Research Question 1); Are EE wives in transnational interethnic couples exposed to more areas of potential vulnerabilities compared to EE wives who are in intraethnic EE-EE immigrant couples? (Research Question 2). To answer these questions a 1 % representative sample from 2008 - 2010 American Community Survey was used. Results from Project 1 suggested that preference for a traditional wife, limited opportunities of a local marriage market, and husband's exposure to diversity could be the factors that motivate U. S. -born husbands' to seek spouses transnationally. The findings from Project 2 suggested that certain areas of vulnerability described in previous qualitative studies could be a reality of Eastern European marriage migrants.
