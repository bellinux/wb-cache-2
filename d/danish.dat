5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of financial pressure and low enrollment forced the Danish-language based Danebod Folk School to close down. The building was re-opened in 1946 and has since 1947 offered annual summer family camps. Danebod Folk Camp offers <b>Danish</b> cuisine, <b>Danish</b> folk dance, <b>Danish</b> art, and other <b>Danish</b> cultural experiences. In {{the spirit of the}} <b>Danish</b> Folk School system, camp attendees sing <b>Danish</b> songs, dance traditional <b>Danish</b> folk dance, work on crafts and have Danish-based lectures throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>Danish</b> {{colonization}} in the 1700s to {{the beginning}} of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the <b>Danish</b> language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with <b>Danish.</b> Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in <b>Danish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Danish</b> {{football}} champions are {{the winners}} of the highest league of football in Denmark. The title has been contested since 1913, in a varying form of competitions. Since 1991, the winners have been found through the <b>Danish</b> Superliga championship. The <b>Danish</b> football championship is governed by the <b>Danish</b> Football Association (DBU).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} annual Danish-inspired {{celebrations}} in town, including the town parade, Grundlovsdag (<b>Danish</b> Constitution Day), Fastelavn, and Æbleskiver Days. Æbleskiver are traditional <b>Danish</b> pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape. Æbleskiver Days {{is one of}} the town's top attractions, and has been held annually by <b>Danish</b> descendants for more than a hundred years. During this two-day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July, Danebod celebrates its <b>Danish</b> heritage and community. During this festival, there is a parade inspired by <b>Danish</b> traditions and culture that goes down Main Street with floats made by the various neighborhoods. Traditional <b>Danish</b> foods such as medisterpølse, frikadeller, rabarbergrød, rødkål, cream wafers, cinnamon sticks, rosettes, kisses, as well as æbleskiver, smørrebrød, <b>Danish</b> coffee, liver-pâté, and sweets are also popular during the festival. Other activities during Æbleskiver Days include traditional <b>Danish</b> folk dancing, <b>Danish</b> art displays, <b>Danish</b> folk song singing, children's activities, and the fairground fair called Tivoli The Scandinavian tradition of singing and dancing around the Christmas tree still takes place {{at the center of the}} Gym Hall during Christmas time. Some families keep up the tradition of celebrating Christmas Eve on December24. There is a town fair on the <b>Danish</b> Constitution Day, June5. There are still quite a few <b>Danish</b> speakers, especially among the elders.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus {{has three}} major men's {{professional}} sports teams: the Superliga team Aarhus Gymnastik Forening (AGF), <b>Danish</b> Handball League's Aarhus GF Håndbold, and <b>Danish</b> Basketball League's Bakken Bears. Notable or historic clubs include Aarhus 1900, Idrætsklubben Skovbakken and Aarhus Sejlklub. NRGi Park has hosted matches in the premiere <b>Danish</b> soccer league {{since it was}} formed in 1920 and matches for the national men's soccer team in 2006 and 2007. The five sailing clubs routinely win national and international titles {{in a range of}} disciplines and the future national watersports stadium will be located on the Aarhus Docklands in the city centre. The Bakken Bears have most recently won the <b>Danish</b> basketball championships in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|By 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its <b>Danish</b> counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the <b>Danish,</b> which had replaced {{a larger proportion of}} its vessels with more modern warships. The Swedish side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of <b>Danish</b> and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the <b>Danish</b> had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The <b>Danish</b> fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for {{an encounter with}} this Spanish vessel by painting Speedy to resemble a <b>Danish</b> brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a <b>Danish</b> naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with a convoy of <b>Danish</b> merchantmen under a <b>Danish</b> flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E

5|$|During the Northern Seven Years' War, {{attacks were}} {{launched}} on Sweden from <b>Danish</b> Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against <b>Danish</b> provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to <b>Danish</b> Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Fort Dansborg, locally called <b>Danish</b> Fort, is a <b>Danish</b> fort {{located in}} the shores of Bay of Bengal in Tharangambadi in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Fort Dansborg {{was built in the}} land ceded by Thanjavur king Ragunatha Nayak in an {{agreement}} with <b>Danish</b> Admiral Ove Gjedde in 1620 and acted as the base for <b>Danish</b> settlement in the region during the early 17th century. The fort is the second largest <b>Danish</b> fort after Kronborg. The fort was sold to the British in 1845 and along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not an active trading post for the British. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum where the major artifacts of the fort and the <b>Danish</b> empire are displayed.|$|E

5|$|The Tranquebar Association, {{formed in}} 2001, {{with the help}} of the Tamil Nadu State Archaeological Department and the <b>Danish</b> Royal family, {{restored}} the South end of the fort with the same kind of material like brick and black stone, used during the original construction. The renovation was completed in 2005, with contributions from local artisans, <b>Danish</b> volunteers, <b>Danish</b> and Indian experts. In 2001, chemists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) restored the portrait of Raja Ragunatha Naik, Tranquebar site map, pottery, portrait of Christian IV, the <b>Danish</b> King. Metal Halide lamps, which provide a uniform green-coloured lighting, were used for illuminating the exteriors. The restored complex was opened by the Collector of the Nagapattinam District in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The first {{publicly}} {{elected mayor}} of Aarhus was appointed in 1919. In the 1970 <b>Danish</b> Municipal Reform the current Aarhus municipality {{was created by}} merging 20 municipalities. Aarhus was the seat of Aarhus County until the 2007 <b>Danish</b> municipal reform, which substituted the <b>Danish</b> counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with Central Denmark Region (Region Midtjylland), seated in Viborg.|$|E

5|$|The naval Battle of Jasmund (also {{known as}} the Battle of Rügen) took place between {{elements}} of the <b>Danish</b> and Prussian navies on 17 March 1864 during the Second Schleswig War. The action took place east of the Jasmund peninsula on the Prussian island of Rügen, during a Prussian attempt to weaken the <b>Danish</b> blockade in the Baltic Sea. The Prussian squadron, commanded by Eduard von Jachmann, sortied with two steam corvettes, a paddle steamer, and six gunboats to attack the <b>Danish</b> squadron blockading the eastern Prussian coast. The <b>Danish</b> force was commanded by Edvard van Dockum, and it consisted of one steam frigate, one ship of the line, and two steam corvettes. In an action lasting two hours, the superior <b>Danish</b> squadron forced the Prussians to withdraw, both sides suffering damage and light casualties. The <b>Danish</b> victory was compounded {{by the arrival of}} further warships after the battle, which cemented the blockade. The outcome of the battle, and the naval war in the Baltic as a whole, was irrelevant to the outcome of the war, however, as the Prussian and Austrian armies decisively defeated the Danes on land, forcing them to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{selection}} of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers {{a great variety of}} <b>Danish,</b> ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød – a traditional, <b>Danish</b> lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. <b>Danish</b> pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found {{in all parts of the}} city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily {{newspapers}} were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen.

5|$|Heilmann's {{original}} {{articles were}} publicly ignored by <b>Danish</b> zoologists, but caused considerable unrest behind the scenes. <b>Danish</b> zoologist R.H. Stamm, for example, mocked Heilmann in private letters to Helms {{shortly after the}} publication of his first article. Other <b>Danish</b> zoologists openly expressed their disdain for Heilmann's work as well, including the professors of zoology in Copenhagen University J.E.V. Boas and Hector Jungersen. Despite this, Helms continued to steadfastly support Heilmann and his ideas, which eventually began to gain attention from abroad. In April 1913, the American expert in fossil birds R. W. Shufeldt came across Heilmann's first article by chance. Shufeldt, who was married to a Norwegian, could understand some <b>Danish</b> and was able to interpret Heilmann's work and initiated contact with him shortly thereafter. This opened up the opportunity for international correspondence with distinguished paleontologists for Heilmann, which was instrumental to the recognition of his work outside of Denmark.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, the <b>Danish</b> Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to <b>Danish</b> AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new electro-optical system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, <b>Danish</b> AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with {{a sense that the}} cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. <b>Danish</b> Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the <b>Danish</b> government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the <b>Danish</b> government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of <b>Danish</b> imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E
5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that <b>Danish</b> architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} Functionalism.

5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of <b>Danish</b> music. For many years, he appeared on the <b>Danish</b> hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal <b>Danish</b> Library, sponsored by the <b>Danish</b> government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E
