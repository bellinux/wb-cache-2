2500|$|The first US {{patent for}} a {{circular}} needle was issued in 1918, although in Europe {{they may have}} been used a little earlier. [...] Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a <b>flexible</b> <b>cable</b> and may be used for both knitting flat or knitting in the round. [...] The two tapered ends, typically 4–5 inches (10.5–13cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or coated wire). [...] The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from [...] to [...] or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. [...] The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a new multi-site probe array applied with parylene technology, used for neural prostheses to record high-level cognitive neural signals. Instead of inorganic materials (e. g. silicon dioxide, silicon nitride), the electrodes and conduction traces on probes are insulated by parylene, {{which is a}} polymer material with high electrical resistivity, mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility and easy deposition process. As a result, the probes exhibit better electrical and mechanical properties. The all dry process is demonstrated to fabricate these probe arrays with monolithically integrated parylene <b>flexible</b> <b>cables</b> using double-side-polished (DSP) wafers. With the parylene <b>flexible</b> <b>cables,</b> the probes can be easily assembled to a high density 3 -D array for chronic implantation. D I...|$|R
