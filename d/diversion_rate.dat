25|$|The {{second term}} of the Binns {{government}} saw continued economic growth with new business investment,economic diversification, export and tourism growth, and construction of the Atlantic Technology Centre in Charlottetown {{as a catalyst for}} development of the burgeoning IT sector. Investments continued in education and health care for extensive school construction and repair, creation of the PEI Cancer Treatment Centre in Charlottetown and Prince County Hospital in Summerside. The province's first Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was also passed. During this time Prince Edward Island launched Waste Watch, becoming the first Canadian province to offer waste management services to every home and business resulting in a 65% waste <b>diversion</b> <b>rate</b> and closure of many community landfills. Investments were also made to expand renewable energy use with the development of the North Cape Wind Farm in West Prince, strengthening Prince Edward Island's credentials as a national leader in environmental sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Phytogeographically, Belgium {{is shared}} between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the {{territory}} of Belgium belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests. Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some environmental problems. However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, {{the state of the}} environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked {{as one of the top}} 10 countries (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest waste recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste <b>diversion</b> <b>rate</b> in Europe. Almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Florida {{has been}} at the center of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing {{prescription}} opioid epidemic, with largely unregulated pain clinics and lax prescribing oversight cited as significant contributors to the opioid problem in the state. METHODS: In an effort to mitigate prescription opioid abuse and diversion in Florida, legislative interventions were implemented during 2010 and 2011, which included two primary elements: (i) comprehensive legislation to better regulate the operation of pain clinics; and (ii) a statewide prescription drug monitoring program to promote safer prescribing practices. Using systematic longitudinal data collected on a quarterly basis from law enforcement agencies across Florida, this report examined changes in prescription opioid <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> following implementation of these regulatory initiatives. Quarterly <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> for buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol were calculated, and subsequently, hierarchical linear models were fit to test for differences in <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> over the 15 quarter period of interest. RESULTS: Significant declines in <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> were observed for oxycodone, methadone, and morphine; hydrocodone displayed a marginally significant decline. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented reductions in statewide opioid <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> following implementation of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s pain clinic and prescription drug monitoring program legislative interventions. Although these initial findings appear promising, continued surveillance of diversion is clearly warranted...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a comprehensive guideline {{to estimate the}} traffic <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> and capacity reduction for work zones. The analysis of the traffic diversion patterns with data from past work zones in the metro freeway network in Minnesota resulted {{in a set of}} the diversion-estimation models that relate the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> at freeway ramps with the travel times and speed levels on a freeway and alternative routes during construction. The interrelationship between diversion and work-zone traffic conditions has {{led to the development of}} an iterative process, where a freeway simulation model interacts with the diversion-estimation models until a convergence is achieved between diversion and resulting freeway delays. Freeval is adopted in this study as the simulation tool for freeways. The test results of the iterative process with the work zone data showed promising results in determining both the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> and freeway delay for a given work-zone. Due to the types of the work zones used in developing the diversion models, the iterative process developed in this study can be applicable to only "two-to-one" lane reduction cases in estimating the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> for the mainline exit flows, while the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> at entrance ramps can be determined without such restrictions. The capacity analysis of the lane-closure sections performed in this study has also resulted in a set of the suggested capacity values for the work zones with two-to- one lane reduction...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{structure}} is designed based on hydraulic theories or guidelines. To ensure performance, physical model tests {{are often used}} at high discharges. However, high discharge in river is rare. Physical model tests at high discharges will probably lead biased hydrological relationship. To improve hydrological relationship at low discharges, in this study, we considered the <b>diversion</b> <b>rating</b> curve of the Yuanshanzi Diversion Work. The 1 / 100 -scaled physical model tests at low and high discharges (90 - 1620 m 3 /s) were performed and coupled the diversion discharges of 5 flood events (2009 - 2010) in field. The official <b>diversion</b> <b>rating</b> curve was built only based on physical model tests at high discharges (837 - 1620 m 3 /s). The results of physical model tests in this study suggested the official <b>diversion</b> <b>rating</b> curve should be modified considering all tests. The modifi-cations showed the official <b>diversion</b> <b>rating</b> curve was over-estimated. A complete series of physi-cal model tests and considering field situations, in this study, indicated expanded physical model tests and constantly field measurements were therefore necessary for hydraulic structure, which provided information to modify used hydrological relationship to fit real situations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{comparative}} analysis of three university recycling programs. This study looked at several aspects of the programs that included the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates,</b> per capita ratios of materials recycled and disposed, and the average net costs of waste disposal and waste diversion. The universities included in this study were the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of Oregon. To gather the information necessary for this analysis, I contacted each of the university’s recycling coordinators. To determine the average net costs of waste disposal and waste diversion I requested both the recycling budget and solid waste budget from each university for the fiscal years of interest which included: 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008, and 2008 - 2009. To calculate the <b>diversion</b> <b>rates</b> and per capita ratios, I requested performance records from each university listing the tonnage of materials recycled and disposed for the same years. This study’s findings reported that the average net costs for waste diversion in all three universities were $ 22 -$ 122 less per ton than costs for waste collection and disposal. This study also indicated that the universities with the highest <b>diversion</b> and recycling <b>rates</b> were the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Oregon.
