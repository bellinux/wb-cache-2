5000|$|The {{high prices}} of alcohol {{beverages}} in Indonesia, caused by high taxation and restriction, {{has led to}} the rampant case of illegal alcohol in the country. As the legal and imported alcoholic beverages become unaffordable, locals turn to illegal bootlegged alcohol for a cheaper binge. These illegal alcoholic drinks are known in Indonesian as alkohol oplosan (lit. [...] "solved alcohol") and account for over 80% of the alcohol consumed in Indonesia. These illicitly produced liquors which are traditionally home-made, are considered illegal by Indonesian law, due to the high incident of deadly alcohol poisoning. The lapen liquor from Yogyakarta for example, is made from industrial alcohol of 85% mixed with water with 1:4 or 5 alcohol to water ratio; then mixed with <b>fruit</b> <b>essence</b> as flavouring agent.|$|E
5000|$|The process {{used today}} is {{virtually}} unchanged since the 1850s. Noilly Prat is made exclusively from white grape varieties {{grown in the}} Marseillan area, principally Picpoul de Pinet and Clairette. These produce light, fruity wines which are matured in massive Canadian oak casks inside the original storerooms. The wine stays in these casks for 8 months, maturing and absorbing the flavour of the wood, before being transferred to smaller oak barrels which are taken outside and left for a year. Here {{they are exposed to}} the sun, wind, and low winter temperatures, while the wine is slowly changing. The result is a wine that is dry, full-bodied and amber coloured, similar to Madeira or Sherry. During the year outside, 6 to 8% of the volume is lost to evaporation, the [...] "angels' share".Brought back inside and left to rest for a few months, the wines are then blended together into oak casks. A small quantity of Mistelle (grape juice and alcohol) is added to the wines in order to soften them, along with a dash of <b>fruit</b> <b>essence</b> to accentuate their flavour.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Previously, it has {{not been}} {{possible}} to obtain a concentrated ripe Bartlett pear essence. From studies of Bartlett pear aroma characteristics, it was found that methyl and ethyl decadienoates are the components contributing to the characteristic ripe Bartlett pear aroma. It was also found that only perfume-like aroma products, lacking in typical Bartlett pear aroma, could be obtained in the early pear essence recovery trials. Thus, a laboratory scale <b>fruit</b> <b>essence</b> recovery unit was designed and built to study the difficulties in pear essence recovery. Water was first used to calibrate the unit, then, apple juice was applied as a testing model to establish the basic essence recovery effectiveness of the unit. It was found that the high heat provided by the reboiler, would drive the high-boiling, low-volatile pear aroma components upward to the fractionating column top where they could be recovered as overhead product. The high-boiling compounds were found in the reboiler discharge water in the low-heat tests. A good, strong and characteristic ripe Bartlett pear essence was obtained in the high-heat pear essence recovery test. A concept of separating low-boiling alcohols from high-boiling esters, to avoid the interference from low-boiling alcohols in the concentrating high-boiling esters. was substantiated through developing a two-stage essence recovery unit. Characteristic Bartlett pear essence of 100 fold was produced successfully in the two-stage test. Along with the organoleptic evaluation, the essence product was also analyzed by GC-MS and UV spectrometry to confirm the presence of "decadienoates" — characteristic Bartlett pear aroma components. This {{is the first time that}} a typical and good quality ripe Bartlett pear essence of 100 fold has been recovered...|$|E

Worried {{about the future of the}} company, which was facing bankruptcy, he had the idea of producing a nonalcoholic drink by fermentation, on the same principles and under the same purity laws as German beer: the drink would consist only of the natural ingredients malt, water, sugar, and <b>fruit</b> <b>essences,</b> and would not contain corn syrup or other artificial additives. He experimented for eight years in a bathroom laboratory, spending €1.5 million of the brewery owner Peter Kowalsky's money. He isolated a strain of bacteria capable of converting the sugar that normally becomes alcohol into nonalcoholic gluconic acid, which he used to ferment the new drink.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of red guava juice and red dragon <b>fruit</b> peel <b>essence</b> addition on yoghurt acceptability and total cost. The research used a factorial design of 5 repetitions on 5 formulas. There are 1 control formula (F 0) and 4 modiﬁ cation formulas (F 1, F 2, F 4, F 5) with the addition of red guava juice and red dragon fruit peel. The panelist on this research consist of 30 untrainedpanelists. Descriptive analysis and inferential statistic using Friedman and Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test with α = 0, 05 were used to analyze the difference of acceptability between the formulas. Panelists showed that the best treatment was F 4 yoghurt formula (44 % addition of fruit juice with the ratio of guava juice and red dragon fruit peel 50 : 50) and it has the most preferred acceptability (color, aroma, texture, and taste) with the average value was 2. 91 and food cost per serving (100 ml) was Rp 2. 900, 00. Formula F 4 has a good acceptability and lower total cost than commercialyoghurt. This formula has a potential to be an alternative functional drink. The aroma of yoghurt can be increased by eliminate cooking process on the red dragon fruit peel juice...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi elaborar uma bebida a partir da fermentação do extrato hidrossolúvel de soja por culturas probióticas, com adição de polpa e essência de frutas e verificar sua aceitabilidade. O número de colônias viáveis de bactérias lácticas na bebida fermentada armazenada a 5 º C durante 21 dias foi {{superior}} a 107 UFC/mL, valores que estão de acordo com o exigido pela legislação vigente para produtos probiótios. As bebidas fermentadas com sabor de abacaxi e limão obtiveram aceitação significativamente maior pelos julgadores nos testes sensoriais, se comparado ao sabor de ameixa preta. Os resultados deste estudo demonstraram que o extrato hidrossolúvel de soja com 2 % de sacarose possibilitou o cultivo de bactérias láticas para obtenção de uma bebida próbiótica, e adição de frutas no produto propiciou um incremento na qualidade sensorial com boa aceitação pelo consumidor. AbstractThe {{soy bean}} water soluble extract has chemical and nutritional characteristics that qualify it as a functional food; however, {{it has little}} acceptability amongst the consumers because it tastes like raw beans.

The amount of viable lactic bacteria cells in the fermented drink stored at 5 º C during 21 days was greater than 107 UFC/mL. The values are consistent with those established by the current Brazilian law for probiotical products. When compared with the black plum flavor, the fermented drinks with pineapple and lemon flavors had significantly better acceptability for the subjects in the sensorial tests. The results of this study have demonstrated that the water soluble soybean extract with 2 % of saccharose allowed for the culture of lactic bacteria for the making of a probiotical drink, and the addition of fruits to the product improved the sensorial quality with good acceptance by the consumer...|$|R
