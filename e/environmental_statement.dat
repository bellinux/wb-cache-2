25|$|Network Rail {{revised the}} {{original}} proposal and submitted {{it along with}} an updated <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statement</b> dated 14 June 2004. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Transport called for a new public inquiry to begin in September 2005. During this period the Strategic Rail Authority was abolished by the Railways Act of 2005, and the Department for Transport (DfT) took over funding responsibility for the project in July 2005.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the Deputy Prime Minister said in January 2003 {{that the}} project would not receive {{approval}} and that Network Rail (which had replaced Railtrack by this time) must submit improved proposals and a new <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statement.</b> The delay also led to the 'Thameslink 2000 Agreement', the contract that obliged Network Rail/Railtrack to maintain responsibility for funding the project, being terminated in April 2003. Responsibility for project funding was subsequently transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority.|$|E
25|$|A {{joint venture}} between consultancies Arup and Jacobs was {{appointed}} as project manager, and in February 2008 environmental and technical studies were begun, continuing through 2009. Public consultations were held, and some changes to the scheme were made {{in response to the}} comments received. An <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> was published in November 2009, coinciding with the introduction of the Forth Crossing Bill into the Scottish Parliament by John Swinney. A majority of MSPs voted in favour of the new legislation on 16 December 2010, and the Forth Crossing Act received Royal Assent in January 2011.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a classification for environmental indicators that can be used to communicate companies' environmental performance in Emas <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statements</b> and to assess their actual use in certified <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statements.</b> Starting from the ISO 14031 draft indicators classification we have tried to verify its correspondence with EMAS EEC Council Regulation (93 / 1836 /EEC) requirements and definitions, and therefore we have established a more appropriate classification according to the information the different indicators can provide.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an empirical study addressing current tendencies in corporate environmental reporting {{released to the}} public. On the one hand, we survey British and German <b>environmental</b> <b>statements</b> according to the ‘European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme’. On the other hand, we explore why companies desist from participating in EMAS and thereby from publishing <b>environmental</b> <b>statements.</b> For this purpose, we have conducted a telephone survey with those companies in Northrhine – Westfalia, Germany, which have participated in EMAS twice but have dropped out afterwards. In doing so, the survey also intends to explore whether other types of corporate environmental reporting are increasingly employed in place of <b>environmental</b> <b>statements.</b> All in all, the goal of our study is to derive assumptions about future developments of corporate environmental reporting...|$|R

25|$|Despite its {{having been}} closed for over 100 years, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statement</b> for the {{construction}} on a new junction on the M8 motorway noted that {{the course of the}} canal was still clearly visible to {{the eastern edge of the}} shipyard site, and concluded that much of it probably still existed. A subsequent planning application for the development of the shipyard site stated that although it had been intended to reinstate a short section of the canal as a water feature, investigation had shown that there were no substantial remains of the canal left, and the planning restrictions that protected the line of the canal were rescinded.|$|E
500|$|Further {{official}} {{confirmation of}} restricted (dioxin containing) herbicide storage on Okinawa {{appeared in a}} 1971 Fort Detrick report titled [...] "Historical, Logistical, Political and Technical Aspects of the Herbicide/Defoliant Program", which mentioned that the <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> should consider [...] "Herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in PACOM (Pacific Command) U.S. Government restricted materials Thailand and Okinawa (Kadena AFB)."

500|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} route between Switch Island and the main Southport Road was first identified {{as far back as}} 1968, during planning for the M57, M58, and M62 motorways. Shortly after the motorways opened, a number of proposals to allow traffic to bypass Thornton and Netherton were developed, given increased road traffic over the years that followed added to the congestion throughout Thornton. A Sefton Council <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> in 2010 made reference to the traffic congestion that had affected routes around the Thornton area for [...] "many years", as well as the impacts to quality of life and the environment.|$|E

500|$|The {{portion of}} the {{environmental}} debate with the biggest symbolic impact took place when discussing the pipeline's impact on caribou herds. Environmentalists proposed that the pipeline would {{have an effect on}} caribou similar to the effect of the U.S. transcontinental railroad on the American Bison population of North America. Pipeline critics said the pipeline would block traditional migration routes, making caribou populations smaller and making them easier to hunt. This idea was exploited in anti-pipeline advertising, most notably when a picture of a forklift carrying several legally shot caribou was emblazoned with the slogan, [...] "There is {{more than one way to}} get caribou across the Alaska Pipeline". The use of caribou as an example of the pipeline's environmental effects reached a peak in the spring of 1971, when the draft <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> was being debated.|$|E

In the republished <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statement</b> summary, the Highways Agency admit that the scheme will entail [...] "an estimated increase of 9% in emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide". However, in a Statement of the Area address on 21 November 2006, the Leader of Tameside Council announced that 4,500trees had already been planted, increasing to 10,000 to compensate for the loss of trees when the bypass is built and to help mitigate the increases in CO2 emissions. [...] The council leader also claimed that each tree planted would offset 75kg of CO2 per annum. This figure—for trees to be planted in northern England—is 3.5times greater than that for trees planted in tropical rainforests.|$|E
