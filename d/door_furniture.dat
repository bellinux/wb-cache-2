50|$|The {{economy of}} Columbus County centers on two {{different}} industries: agriculture and manufacturing. Columbus farmers produce crops such as pecans and peanuts along with soybeans, potatoes, and corn. Cattle, poultry, and catfish are other agricultural products in Columbus County. Factories in the region focus on textiles, tools, and plywood. Household products such as <b>doors,</b> <b>furniture,</b> and windows are other manufactured goods produced in Columbus.|$|R
25|$|Based on {{the results}} of this and other {{laboratory}} and clinical studies, St. Francis Private Hospital, a 140-bed facility located in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland, decided to become the first hospital in the world to fully specify hygienic copper door handles throughout its facility as part of its infection control program. A full upgrade of all <b>door</b> <b>furniture</b> (i.e., 250 doorsets, incorporating handles, push plates and privacy locks) to antimicrobial copper in the hospital and nursing home commenced in January 2010.|$|E
2500|$|W.H. Hatchard-Smith of London architects Bertram and Company {{designed}} the Dyers Almshouses, which are [...] "a {{good example of}} a comprehensively planned group of residential buildings" [...] and are a significant historical feature in relation to Crawley's transition from market town to carefully planned postwar New Town. In design, they share features with [...] "rural Dutch cottages" [...] while being mostly in the Arts and Crafts style. There are no other buildings of this style either in Crawley or in nearby areas of Sussex. At {{the time they were}} built, local building firm Longley and Company were working on dozens of commissions in the area, particularly for the Crawley Development Corporation in relation to the New Town masterplan, but most of their work was architecturally unassuming: New Town buildings were typically [...] "run-of-the-mill, curtain-walled ... a reassuring uniformity with nothing regimented about it". Accordingly, the almshouses stand out: they have large and ornate brick chimney-stacks, steep roofs reaching nearly to ground level, deep tile-hung gables and stock brick walls in two shades of red (darker brick is used around the windows). Heavy Tudor-style oak doors with iron <b>door</b> <b>furniture</b> survive. Some of the iron drainpipes from the old almshouses at Islington were apparently recovered when they were sold and were reinstated on the new buildings: several bear the date 1852. [...] The buildings surround a quadrangle-style courtyard with formal planting, low walls, fences and hedges, telephone boxes and a former boiler-house.|$|E

25|$|Each mission had to {{fabricate}} {{virtually all of}} its construction materials from local materials. Workers in the carpintería (carpentry shop) used crude methods to shape beams, lintels, and other structural elements; more skilled artisans carved <b>doors,</b> <b>furniture,</b> and wooden implements. For certain applications bricks (ladrillos) were fired in ovens (kilns) to strengthen them and make them more resistant to the elements; when tejas (roof tiles) eventually replaced the conventional jacal roofing (densely packed reeds) they {{were placed in the}} kilns to harden them as well. Glazed ceramic pots, dishes, and canisters were also made in mission kilns.|$|R
50|$|In the '70s, David and Steven Sussman—Isadore's grandchildren—joined the {{business}} and brought it a step further. They developed thermally broken windows and opened up markets in sloped glazing applications such as skylights and greenhouses. Besides bending architectural systems, they were bending handrails, lighting fixtures, signs, shower <b>doors,</b> <b>furniture</b> {{and a host of}} other products for numerous industries. In the 1990s, the fourth generation of Robin, Jake, Jon and Josh came into the family business. The thermal window lines were updated to the advanced thermal strip technology and new lines of historical replication windows and equal sitelines with concealed ventilators windows were introduced.|$|R

50|$|Received signal {{strength}} indication (RSSI) is a measurement of the power level received by sensor. Because radio waves propagate according to the inverse-square law, distance can be approximated based {{on the relationship between}} transmitted and received {{signal strength}} (the transmission strength is a constant based on the equipment being used), as long as no other errors contribute to faulty results. The inside of buildings is not free space, so accuracy is significantly impacted by reflection and absorption from walls. Non-stationary objects such as <b>doors,</b> <b>furniture,</b> and people can pose an even greater problem, as they can affect the signal strength in dynamic, unpredictable ways.|$|R
