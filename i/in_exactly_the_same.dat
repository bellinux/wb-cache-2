5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio. The movement is the most economical of all: the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way.|$|E
5|$|A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions but {{is subject to the}} Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> state at the same time. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.|$|E

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has {{to decide how to}} divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|In the unbroadcast pilot We Are Mongrels, another {{character}} was included called Debbie. Debbie was a suicidal chicken who never left her coop. However, {{it was decided}} that the character did not go anywhere and could not be sustained for a full series, so the {{character was}} axed. Another chicken character called Wendy appeared in the first broadcast episode as a reference to Debbie. Both characters had the same voice actress, Ruth Bratt, who performed Wendy's voice <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as that of Debbie.|$|E
5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
50|$|Each episode {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> basic formula, {{using all}} of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> segments <b>in</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> order. <b>The</b> segments and their characters are as follows.|$|R

25|$|Triple M {{tested the}} concept of FM {{talkback}} in 1999 with The Spoonman adding his controversial opinion every weeknight. The program was shelved {{at the end of}} the year, but returned in 2005 <b>in</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> format.|$|R
5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting this assertion, Ishii has also {{said in an interview}} that Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|Democratisation {{still left}} open one {{important}} {{distinction between the}} former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government {{the same degree of}} powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, {{at the end of which}} the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly.|$|E
60|$|The {{story was}} repeated; it was, <b>in</b> effect, <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as before, without any {{deviation}} or omission. Richard Swiveller {{kept his eyes}} fixed on his visitor during its narration, and directly it was concluded, took the word again.|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} fourth order {{cumulant}} will satisfy the M-order linear prediction equations <b>in</b> lag <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as <b>the</b> signal does {{that in time}} (Sircar and Mukhopadhyay 1995; Deprettere 1988). Moreover, the modes of the cumulant are the square modes of the signal, and the product modes as defined earlier are missing.|$|R
50|$|As {{regards to}} {{military}} officials, there were <b>in</b> force <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rules who applied to military officer ranks. However, military officials wore only four-leaved star rosettes {{instead of the}} rank stars (the only exception: officials with explicit star ranks!).|$|R
5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way they had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary {{in the final two}} rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E

Final point standings ties will be decided by which manufacturer has more wins, second-place finishes, etc., as necessary to determine the winner.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms {{has proven to}} be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using pre-operative data.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} stylus motion can {{be represented}} {{in terms of the}} vector sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Vertical stylus motion then carries the L−R difference signal and horizontal stylus motion carries the L+R summed signal, the latter representing the monophonic component of the signal <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as a purely monophonic record.|$|E

50|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a risk-neutral employer. The offered wage is the expected marginal product. Signals may be acquired by sustaining signalling costs (monetary and not). If everyone invests in <b>the</b> signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, then <b>the</b> signal can't used as discriminatory, therefore a critical assumption is made: the costs of signalling are negatively correlated with productivity. This situation as described is a feedback loop: the employer updates his beliefs upon new market information and updates the wage schedule, applicants react by signalling and recruitment takes place.|$|R

25|$|Leptons are spin- particles. The spin-statistics theorem thus {{implies that}} they are fermions and thus {{that they are}} subject to the Pauli {{exclusion}} principle: No two leptons of the same species can be <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique.
