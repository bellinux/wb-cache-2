5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of <b>footpaths.</b> The large number of <b>footpaths</b> causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer <b>footpaths.</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{responsible}} for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake.

5|$|Oak Meadow Park {{is a small}} park on Station Road, with a large grass {{area and}} woodland. In the early 2000s it was renovated and refurbished, with new fences, benches and <b>footpaths.</b> The project to {{maintain}} and improve the park is a continuous process overseen by a local volunteer group.

5|$|Rivington is {{situated}} on the moorland fringe between the high unenclosed moorland of the West Pennine Moors and the fields below. The landscape is characterised by marginal pastures with isolated farmsteads, reservoirs and disused mines and quarries scattered across the hillsides. There is an extensive network of <b>footpaths</b> providing public access. The reservoir valleys are dominated by expanses of water and the Victorian gothic architecture of the dams and embankments surrounded by woodland.|$|E
5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on <b>footpaths</b> or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy <b>footpaths,</b> rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs {{may come to}} vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price of}} goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E
