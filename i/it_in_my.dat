5|$|I had <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
25|$|If anybody {{happens to}} catch {{me in the}} act of {{harvesting}} mud, I come up with a story to give them a reason I'm putting mud in a bucket. I've told people I use <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> garden, I use it for my rose bushes, I use it for bee stings and poison ivy and any kind of story.|$|E
500|$|Apted (whom the Boston Globe called [...] "the {{superintendent}} of caretakers at Harvard and Harvard Cop No.1") wrote to Wenzler: [...] "As one who is, and was, very {{much interested in}} preserving [...] dignity, and furthermore having held <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> arms... I most respectfully ask a favor, that is: If the greyhound be substituted, that I be presented with the cod in order {{that it may be}} preserved for the future of young Americans." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was some}} racially tinged comic bantering in the series, such as scenes with Noland giving cotton to {{a nurse and}} stating, [...] "Honey, picking cotton is part of my heritage," [...] or observing some {{adhesive}} strips labeled [...] "flesh colored" [...] and remarking, [...] "Maybe this is your idea of flesh colored, but it wouldn't make <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> neighborhood." [...] Aside from these, racial issues were avoided, as Asher and Ackerman felt that ABC {{was not interested in}} having them mixed into the comedy.|$|E
500|$|However, Biden {{did not see}} a rise in his {{poll numbers}} {{immediately}} after the Hart withdrawal, and was particularly stagnant in polls for the Iowa caucuses. [...] Nevertheless, Biden had confidence that he could prevail; {{on the eve of}} his announcement, he said: [...] "I'm going to win this thing. I really am. I just know it, I can feel <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fingertips." [...] Some political professionals saw Biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win the race, but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him credibility as a candidate.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact that I saw <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I ain’t {{got it all}} ship-shape {{and proper}} yet," [...] said Mr. Benn, slowly, [...] "but <b>it’s</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind’s eye. <b>It’s</b> been there off and on like for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Part {{of it is}} on the mantelpiece," [...] said Mrs. Gannett, {{trying to}} speak calmly, [...] "part of <b>it</b> is <b>in</b> a bonnet-box upstairs, some of <b>it’s</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket, and here is the remainder." ...|$|R
500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|E
500|$|... {{a banner}} which gave a {{wonderful}} omen. I am {{well aware that}} this may seem incredible to the reader, but nevertheless I insert <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> veracious work because it is true: This banner was woven of the cleanest and whitest silk and no picture of any figures was found on it. In case of war, however, a raven was always to be seen, {{as if it were}} woven into it. If the Danes were going to win the battle, the raven appeared, beak wide open, flapping its wings and restless on its feet. If {{they were going to be}} defeated, the raven did not stir at all, and its limbs hung motionless.|$|E
500|$|The epic-sounding, Clams Casino-produced opening track, [...] "Palace", has Rocky {{acknowledging}} Southern hip hop's {{influence on}} his sound: [...] "Influenced by Houston / {{you can hear}} <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music". [...] "Wassup" [...] has an ethereal, Houston-inspired soundscape. However, Chase McMullen of Beats Per Minute observes from the mixtape's sound the [...] "threatening vibe" [...] of Raekwon's 1995 album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and a grime influence, commenting that [...] "while southern influences currently dominate much of current hip hop, Rocky places as much importance on the Wu as he does Three 6." [...] Paul Lester of The Guardian compares [...] "Peso" [...] to the stylings of The Jet Age of Tomorrow. [...] "Trilla" [...] has a funk and boom bap influence in its production.|$|E

Kurt Dorn's ordeal will be worse than death for him. But I believe as I pray--that he will come home alive." ...|$|R

500|$|On November 21, 2011, Clarkson {{announced}} on her website {{that she wanted}} to incorporate a global flash mob into the accompanying music video of [...] "Stronger". She posted: [...] "I'm shooting my video for [...] "What Doesn't Kill You" [...] and I'd like everyone to join me in my global flash mob! Check out the routine in the video below.

Thanks for participating!" ...|$|E
500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - I can give the page number right away...I have <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I want to say this here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E
500|$|After the {{commercial}} success of Believe (1998), Cher released her twenty-third studio album not.com.mercial in late 2000. It was sold exclusively online {{and had a}} [...] "not commercial" [...] sound, hence she did not consider it as an [...] "official" [...] follow-up to Believe. The singer began work on her twenty-fourth studio album in 2000. She began giving hints of the album at the time, calling it [...] "son of Believe" [...] because [...] "that's how I differentiate <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind", and elaborated that [...] "If you liked Believe, you're going to love the new one, because the new one is so much fun", calling it [...] "so terrific". Cher commented {{about one of the}} songs she was considering for the album while recording it, saying she [...] "almost killed" [...] herself while she was dancing in the shower.|$|E
6000|$|She {{touched the}} thought, [...] "It would be sweet {{to have a}} baby of my own. I do want one. Tiny----No! Not yet! There's so much to do. And I'm still tired from the job. <b>It's</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bones." ...|$|R

500|$|According to Rodriguez, [...] " [...] had an {{idea and}} a {{complete}} vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started {{to tell me the}} story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it Death Proof. I helped title the movie, but that's it." [...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> stomach. It's just action." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The tour {{started on}} 28 October 1973. The {{original}} plan {{had been to}} play most of the album, but after the first gig at Stoke-on-Trent, the band dropped [...] "The Dirty Jobs", [...] "Is <b>It</b> <b>In</b> <b>My</b> Head" [...] and [...] "I've Had Enough" [...] from the set. Both Daltrey and Townshend felt they had to describe the plot in detail to the audience, which took up valuable time on stage. A few shows later in Newcastle upon Tyne, the backing tapes to [...] "5:15" [...] came in late. Townshend stopped the show, grabbed Pridden, who was controlling the mixing desk, and dragged him onstage, shouting obscenities at him. Townshend subsequently picked {{up some of the}} tapes and threw them over the stage, kicked his amplifier over, and walked off. The band returned 20 minutes later, playing older material. Townshend and Moon appeared on local television the following day and attempted to brush things off. The Who played two other shows in Newcastle without incident.|$|E

6000|$|Well, he saw <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their {{constant}} comprehensive way. [...] "Since {{what she}} builds {{on is the}} gradual process of your alienation, she may take {{the view that the}} process constantly requires me. Mustn't I be there to keep <b>it</b> going? <b>It's</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> exile that <b>it</b> may languish." ...|$|R

500|$|For {{the second}} European leg of Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2009, the {{performance}} of [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was removed from the}} setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen". This performance was included on the show's fourth and final Rave segment, where it was set between the performances of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrops used for this performance featured outtakes from the song's original music video directed by Chris Cunningham. Madonna sampled DJ Calvin Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone" [...] into the performance. Harris praised the version saying, [...] "I never imagined when I made <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little purple room in Glasgow in my flat that it would reach far and wide as it has– it's always a privilege." [...] Six years later, on October 1, 2015, Madonna performed an acoustic version of [...] "Frozen" [...] on the Detroit stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. Four days later, she repeated the performance on the San Jose stop.|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and Lopes and was shot on March 9, 2001. Lopes said of the video, [...] "We are in the wonderful world of Left Eye and <b>it's</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> galaxy, Supernova." [...] Her adopted daughter Snow appeared in the video.|$|R
