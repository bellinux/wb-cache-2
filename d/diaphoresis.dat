5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (<b>diaphoresis).</b> A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E

25|$|Nociception {{can also}} cause {{generalized}} autonomic responses before or without reaching consciousness to cause pallor, <b>diaphoresis,</b> tachycardia, hypertension, lightheadedness, nausea and fainting.|$|E
25|$|Chronic use {{of alcohol}} used to induce sleep can lead to insomnia: {{frequent}} moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and <b>diaphoresis.</b> Stopping chronic alcohol abuse {{can also lead to}} profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{pethidine}} administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, <b>diaphoresis,</b> urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis {{have been attributed to}} accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.|$|E
25|$|Although {{technically}} the antivenin CroFab {{could be}} used to treat an envenomation, it is usually not administered for copperheads, as the risk of complications of an allergic reaction to the treatment are greater than the risk from the snakebite itself in most cases. The antivenin can cause an immune reaction called serum sickness. Pain management, antibiotics, and medical supervision in the case of complications is usually the course of action. In 2002, an Illinois poison control center report on the availability of antivenin stated it used 1 Acp to 5 Acp depending on the symptoms and circumstances. The symptoms of a mild envenomation include swelling of the hand, mild cellulitis, and respiratory distress. The symptoms of a moderate envenomation would include swelling of the hand, vomiting, mild bleeding, ecchymosis, <b>diaphoresis,</b> sinus tachycardia, and hypotension.|$|E
25|$|The British National Formulary {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor {{sites in the}} central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or over-rapid reduction in dosage. However, despite increasing demand for safe and effective antipsychotic withdrawal protocols or dose-reduction schedules, no specific guidelines with proven safety and efficacy are currently available. Support {{groups such as the}} Icarus Project, and other online forums provide resources and social support for those attempting to discontinue antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications. Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, <b>diaphoresis,</b> dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and anxiety. Some have argued additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic hypersensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics. Thus, some suggest the withdrawal process itself may be schizo-mimetic, producing schizophrenia-like symptoms even in previously healthy patients.|$|E

2500|$|Atropine {{is given}} as a {{treatment}} for SLUDGE syndrome (salivation, lacrimation, urination, <b>diaphoresis,</b> gastrointestinal motility, emesis) symptoms caused by organophosphate poisoning. [...] Another mnemonic is DUMBBELSS, which stands for diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, excitation (as of muscle in the form of fasciculations and CNS), lacrimation, salivation, and sweating (only sympathetic innervation using muscarinic receptors).|$|E
2500|$|A fully paralyzed {{patient is}} unable to move, speak, blink the eyes, or {{otherwise}} respond to the pain. It is incorrect to think that physiological signs such as increased heart rate (tachycardia), blood pressure (hypertension), dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), sweating (<b>diaphoresis),</b> {{and the formation of}} tears (lacrimation) will continue to occur normally in response to pain in the anesthetized state [...] [...] If neuromuscular blocking drugs are used this causes skeletal muscle paralysis and interferes with the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. [...] The patient cannot signal their distress and they may not exhibit the signs of awareness that would be expected to be detectable by clinical vigilance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cardinal}} {{symptom of}} decreased {{blood flow to}} the heart is chest pain, experienced as tightness around the chest and radiating to the left arm and the left angle of the jaw. This may be associated with <b>diaphoresis</b> (sweating), nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath. In many cases, the sensation is [...] "atypical", with pain experienced in different ways or even being completely absent (which is more likely in female patients and those with diabetes). Some may report palpitations, anxiety or a sense of impending doom (angor animi) and a feeling of being acutely ill. The description of the chest discomfort as a pressure has little utility in aiding a diagnosis as it is not specific for ACS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diaphoresis</b> is {{also seen}} in an acute {{myocardial}} infarction (heart attack), from the increased firing of the sympathetic nervous system, and is frequent in serotonin syndrome. <b>Diaphoresis</b> can also be caused by many types of infections, often accompanied by fever and/or chills. Most infections can cause some degree of <b>diaphoresis</b> {{and it is a}} very common symptom in some serious infections such as malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, pneumothorax can cause <b>diaphoresis</b> with splinting of the chest wall.Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and other malignant diseases (e.g. leukemias) can also cause <b>diaphoresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Drugs (including caffeine, morphine, alcohol, {{antidepressants}} {{and certain}} antipsychotics) may be causes, {{as well as}} withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines or narcotic painkiller dependencies. Sympathetic nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines have also been associated with <b>diaphoresis.</b> <b>Diaphoresis</b> due to ectopic catecholamine is a classic symptom of a pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. some insecticides) also cause contraction of sweat gland smooth muscle leading to <b>diaphoresis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Perspiration, {{also known}} as {{sweating}} or <b>diaphoresis,</b> is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{symptoms}} of myocardial infarction mainly include chest pain, dyspnea, <b>diaphoresis</b> (an excessive form of sweating), weakness, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations.|$|E
5000|$|Terazosin, an α1-adrenergic {{antagonist}} {{approved to}} treat {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (enlarged prostate) and hypertension, is (one of several drugs) used off-label to treat drug induced <b>diaphoresis</b> and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).|$|E
50|$|Both {{the words}} <b>diaphoresis</b> and {{hidrosis}} can mean either perspiration (in which sense they are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration, {{in which case}} they refer to a specific, narrowly defined, clinical disorder.|$|E
50|$|Note any restlessness, flushing, or <b>diaphoresis</b> {{during the}} examination. Vital signs may {{disclose}} low-grade fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. Inspect the skin for jaundice. Assess the abdomen for distention, tenderness, discoloration, and diminished bowel sounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{organophosphate}} poisoning on muscarinic receptors are recalled using the mnemonic SLUDGEM (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal motility, emesis, miosis) An additional mnemonic is MUDDLES: miosis, urination, diarrhea, <b>diaphoresis,</b> lacrimation, excitation, and salivation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diaphoresis</b> may be {{associated}} with some abnormal conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and shock. If it is accompanied by unexplained weight loss or fever or by palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort, it suggests serious illness.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of a cholinergic toxidrome include bronchorrhea, confusion, defecation, <b>diaphoresis,</b> diarrhea, emesis, lacrimation, miosis, muscle fasciculations, salivation, seizures, urination, and weakness. Complications include bradycardia, hypothermia, and tachypnea. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include carbamates, mushrooms, and organophosphates.|$|E
50|$|During {{medical doctor}} examination, a pericardial {{friction}} rub can be auscultated indicating pericarditis. Auscultation of the lungs can show crackles indicating pulmonary infiltration, and there can be retrosternal/pleuritic chest pain worse on inspiration (breathing in). Patient can also depict sweating (<b>diaphoresis)</b> and agitation or anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Tetracycline-class {{antibiotics}} {{are most}} effective. These can, however, induce a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in over half those treated, producing anxiety, <b>diaphoresis,</b> fever, tachycardia and tachypnea {{with an initial}} pressor response followed rapidly by hypotension. Recent studies have shown tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be partly responsible for this reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The words <b>diaphoresis</b> and {{hidrosis}} {{both can}} mean either perspiration (in which sense they are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration (in which sense {{they can be}} either synonymous with hyperhidrosis or differentiable from it only by clinical criteria involved in narrow specialist senses of the words).|$|E
50|$|Side effects {{associated}} with ospemifene include vaginal discharge, hot flashes, and <b>diaphoresis.</b> More serious adverse effects {{are similar to}} those of estrogens and estrogen receptor modulators. These include, but are not limited to, thromboembolism, allergic reactions, fatigue, and headache, and others could occur. There are other additional adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Delirium tremens: hyperadrenergic state, disorientation, tremors, <b>diaphoresis,</b> {{impaired}} attention/consciousness, {{and visual}} and auditory hallucinations. This usually occurs 24 to 72 hours after alcohol cessation. Delirium tremens {{is the most}} severe form of withdrawal and occurs in 5 to 20% of patients experiencing detoxification and 1/3 of patients experiencing withdrawal seizures.|$|E
