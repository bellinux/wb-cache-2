5|$|The {{barbed wire}} which fenced us in {{did not cause}} us any real fear.... We {{appointed}} a Jewish Council, a Jewish police, an office for social assistance, a labor committee, a hygiene department–a whole government machinery. Everyone marveled at it.

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would <b>have</b> <b>before</b> the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. In years of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but was overwhelmed {{by the forces of}} Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence that they did not <b>have</b> <b>before</b> and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E

5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to speak to a negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to <b>have</b> <b>before</b> he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of drugs to reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E
25|$|Under {{head coach}} Bill Finn, and {{featuring}} early stars like three-time All-American Aleta Mills, Jacqui Phillips, Samatha Louras and goalie Becky Trudel, the Minutemen {{finished second in}} the East Region and received an autobid to the third-ever ACHA National Tournament, in Muskegon, Michigan. UMass performed well at nationals, finishing second in their four-team group after wins over Northern Michigan and St. Cloud State. While that outcome would have meant a trip to the semifinals under subsequent formats, in 2003 it meant that the Minutemen were dumped in the third-place game, where they dropped a decision to West Los Angeles College. Despite the disappointing finish, the program had announced its arrival in a way few <b>have,</b> <b>before</b> or since.|$|E

It was 19 inches in circumference. We afterwards saw others apparently much larger, and Mr. Low, while wandering in search of flowers, came upon one in which was a drowned rat.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} significantly darker themes {{than any}} of Disturbed's previous work, according to the band. Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist David Draiman had endured {{over the course of}} the past few years prior to making the album, including [...] "bad relationships", a motorcycle accident that he was involved with, and an incident of suicide. To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music than they <b>have</b> <b>before.</b> Despite these themes, the title track, [...] "Indestructible", is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their morale.|$|E

[...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot think of any views which I now have that I did not <b>have</b> <b>before</b> the war."

[...] Nonetheless, she praised the episode's ending and asked, [...] "Who cares that the story was a bit weak this time around? It's the last episode we <b>have</b> <b>before</b> the dreaded undetermined hiatus gets underway, and it's Christmas. Let's just cherish the episode for what it is..."

500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to <b>have,</b> <b>before</b> mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E

500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a to-do list of features the game should <b>have</b> <b>before</b> version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He {{says he has been}} able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E
500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in a way we never <b>have</b> <b>before</b> and never will again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E

There, she died on either 15 or 22 January 1555, and was buried on 1 February at Chelsea Old Church. In her will she tried to provide for her sons financially and thanked the Queen, {{as well as the}} many Spanish nobles she had lobbied. The Duchess of Alba was to receive her green parrot; to Don Diego de Acevedo she gave [...] "the new bed of green velvet with all the furniture to it; beseeching him even as he hath in my lifetime showed himself like a father and a brother to my sons, so shall [...] require him no less to do now their mother is gone". She also remembered [...] "my lord, my dear husband", and stipulated: [...] "in no wise let me be opened after I am dead. ... I have not lived to be very bold before women, much more I should be loth to come into the hands of any living man, be he Physician or Surgeon."

500|$|The {{character}} of the Well-Manicured Man has been positively received by critics. MTV's Tami Katzoff has called him a [...] "legendary TV character", noting his [...] "moral ambivalence about {{the work of his}} shadow organization" [...] and his ability to show [...] "empathy for Mulder and Scully". Writing for The A.V. Club, Sean O'Neal praised the character's [...] "unnervingly genteel" [...] manner, noting that he represented the polar opposite of The Smoking Man. Fellow A.V. Club writer Todd VanDerWerff has also been positive towards the Well-Manicured Man, feeling that the series would have benefited from making more use of the character. The San Francisco Chronicle Bob Graham has praised Neville's portrayal of the character in the feature film, calling his expository monologue [...] "a Wagnerian demonstration of the art of declamation". Writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, Michael Liedtke and George Avalos described the character as [...] "white-haired, urbane, genteeland dangerous", noting that he was [...] "equally at ease in Virginia's horse country, the tony rooms of Manhattan's Upper West Side and the antiseptic halls of facilities that house bizarre medical experiments". Den of Geek's countdown of [...] "The Top 10 X-Files Baddies" [...] described the Well-Manicured Man as a [...] "super-smooth, super-creep Brit", noting that he served as [...] "a 'boss' of sorts" [...] for the Smoking Man. Speaking of how the role eclipsed his other acting work, Neville has been quoted as saying [...] "It's OK, though.
