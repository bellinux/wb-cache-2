40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a low-concentration, but important, {{component}} of the Earth's atmosphere. This gas absorbs electromagnetic radiation (EMR) in several regions of the spectrum. Absorption of energy by <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> adds heat to the atmosphere. In the world today, the {{burning of fossil fuels}} and other anthropogenic processes adds <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> to the atmosphere. Other natural processes in the Earth's system both add and remove <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Overall, measurements of atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> at selected sites around the globe show an increased <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentration in the atmosphere. A figure shows the measured <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from 1958 to 2000. Overall, the concentration has increased from 315 to 365 ppm at this site over this period. (There is also a yearly cycle to the concentration that is timed with and hypothesized {{to be related to the}} vegetation growing season in the Northern Hemisphere.) The overall expected effect of this increase of atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is trapping of heat in the atmosphere and global warming. While this overall relationship between <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and global warming seems straightforward, many of the specific details relating to regional and local sources and sinks and gradients of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> are not well understood.
