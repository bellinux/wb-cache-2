5|$|Earlier in the day, {{at about}} 2:30pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the South Vietnamese for more than 10 <b>hours.</b> <b>By</b> 5pm the North Vietnamese 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South Vietnamese ranger battalion.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences.

As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several <b>hours.</b> <b>By</b> midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning.|$|E

The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001.

5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided.

Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed.
