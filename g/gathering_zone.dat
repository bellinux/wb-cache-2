5000|$|Chris J D Kostman in his paper, The Indus Valley Civilization: In Search of Those Elusive Centers and Peripheries http://www.adventurecorps.com/archaeo/centperiph.html, discusses: [...] "A primary, {{if not the}} primary, {{rationale}} for long-range trade driving force would {{be a need for}} 'luxury goods,' raw materials, and other items not found in the riverine alluvial plain which made up {{the vast majority of the}} Indus Civilization. In the Indus Valley, sought-after materials included copper, gold, silver, tin, jasper and agate cherts, carnelian, azurite, lapis, fine shell, steatite, antimony, and ivory. Forays would have been made towards and beyond the civilization's peripheral areas to obtain these goods. At the minimum, then, there is an economic motive for inter-regional travel. Silvio Durante's study (1979) of marine shells from India and their appearance in the archaeological record in such distant sites as Tepe Yahya and Shahr-i-Sokhta in Iran, as well as in the Indus Valley, sheds light on the ancient trading routes of certain types of shells which are specifically and exclusively found along the Indian coastline proper. Durante primarily discusses the marine shell Xancus pyrum and the fact that it was traded whole and intact, then worked or reworked (into jewellry? sic) at its destination site, perhaps then moving on to other locations. The importance of this specific shell is that Xancus pyrum has a very limited geographic distribution and thus has almost the same significance in the field of shells as that of lapis lazuli in the context of mineral resources (as regards the determination of the possible routes along which a locally unavailable raw material is transported from a well-defined place of origin to the place where it is processed and, as also in the case of Xancus pyrum, consumed). Perhaps, as these shells crossed so many cultural hands, they were left unworked in order for the final owner or consumer to work the raw material into a style and usage specific to their region. Durante offers four possible trade routes from their <b>gathering</b> <b>zone</b> along the west and northwest Indian coast to destinations west: sea route direct to the Iranian coastal area; sea route to Sutkagen-dor and Sotka-koh on the Makran coast, then overland westwards; overland through the Indus plain and then through the Makran interior to Sistan; overland through the Indus Valley and then through the Gomal Valley to Sistan." ...|$|E

The study followed the variations which appear at leaf level depending on season of vegetation, <b>gathering</b> <b>zone,</b> stage of development and the differences between healthy leaves and the ones affected by pathogens or diseases. The analyzed parameter was LRWC –leaf relative water content. The leaf relative water content decreased as the seasons passed regardless of the leaf development stage, being more pronounced for the juvenile samples.

But there is not any sufficient and reliable information about its distribution and classification. So its types are categorized according to traditional, local or geographical names or some visual traits. The most important reason is the sterility of garlic and its flowering inability. This study, as the first report of using ISSR and M 13 markers on Iranian garlic ecotypes, was performed to evaluate the genetic diversity and relationship and distinguish the repetitious clones among populations from Iran. According to our results, 26 studied clones were categorized as 24 different genotypes with a possibility of classifying them into four groups coincide with their geographical <b>gathering</b> <b>zone.</b> Group one contains ecotypes from north and western North of Hamadan province and group two contains clones from west and south west of Hamadan province, central, east and south east of Iran.

Exploring the culprit, the undue development of industrialization {{is one of the}} important factor. Especially in Yangtze River Delta, what the most serious water pollution causer is the textile industry, in the meantime, {{it is one of the}} pillar industry in Yangtze River Delta. However how to balance the environmental aspect with the textile industry would be the challenge for us as well as local government. So in this thesis, taking Hangzhou as an example to really figure out the way of integration environment, textile industry and inhabitant in rural area, mainly constructing water treatment system after biochemical treatment in textile mills for degradation of toxic substance involve in waste water, and try to reutilize on-site component such as abandoned channel, fishponds, farmland and demolished poor textile mills, transforming them into components of water treatment system, phytoremediation are introduced to help treatment system, providing an opportunity to integrate these three parts, and improving life quality of textile industrial <b>gathering</b> <b>zone</b> in Hangzhou. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Landscape Architectur...|$|E

Southard ordered David Porter {{to assign}} ships to the Mona Passage, and the {{commodore}} sent the schooner [...] and the brigantine [...] The ships were {{to investigate the}} <b>zone,</b> <b>gathering</b> information at Saint Barthélemy and St. Thomas {{with the goal of}} destroying the base at Mona. Although Porter warned that the pirates were reportedly well-armed and -supplied, he said the crews would probably not find plunder at the base because of the proximity of eastern Puerto Rican ports. On February 8, 1824, the Spark arrived at Mona, conducted reconnaissance and landed. A suspicious schooner was seen, but captain John T. Newton decided not to chase her. The crew found a small settlement with an empty hut and other buildings, a chest of medicine, sails, books, an anchor and documents from William Henry. Newton ordered the base and a large canoe found in the vicinity destroyed, and reported his findings to the Secretary of the Navy. According to another report, the ship sent was the USS Beagle; in this account, several pirates eluded the Beagles crew. Undeterred, Cofresí quickly resettled on Mona.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} aims at {{presenting the}} principles that underlined {{the creation of the}} OZCAR research infras-tructure, <b>gathering</b> various Critical <b>Zone</b> Observatories in France, and the scientific questions that drives theobservation settings. The Critical Zone includes the fine zone between the lower atmosphere {{at the top of the}} canopy down to thebedrock-soil interface. This lithosphere-atmosphere boundary is critical for the availability of life-sustainingresources and critical for humanity because this is the zone where we live, where we build our cities, from whichwe extract our food and our water and where we release most of our wastes. This is the fragile zone on which thenatural ecosystem relies because this is where nutrients are being released from the rocks. OZCAR is a distributed research infrastructure gathering instrumented sites and catchments on continentalsurfaces all dedicated to the observation and monitoring of the different compartments of the Critical Zone atthe national scale. All these observatories (more that 40) were all built up on specific questions (acid deposition,flood prediction, urban hydrology...), some of them more than 50 years ago, but they have all in common tobe highly instrumented, permanently funded as infrastructures. They all share the same overarching goal ofunderstanding and predicting the Critical Zone in a changing world. OZCAR gathers instrumented catchments,hydrogeological sites, peatlands, glacier and permafrost regions and a spatial observatory under the commonumbrella of understanding water and biogeochemical cycles and the associated fluxes of energy by using naturalgradients and experimentation. Based on the collaboration with Southern Countries, OZCAR’s sites have a globalcoverage including tropical areas and high mountainous regions in the Andes and the Himalaya. OZCAR benefits from a French investments project called CRITEX (Innovative equipment for the critical zone,[URL]) that is centered on the development and deployment of innovativeinstrumentation in the sites. OZCAR was launched in 2016 under the leadership of the French Ministry in charge of Higher Education andResearch, assembling all French Research Institutions involved in environmental studies and with the ambitionof facilitating interdisciplinary research in terrestrial surfaces, stimulating instrumental development and beingvisible at the international level. The paper will presents the main common scientific questions, challenges in terms of instrumentation andexperimentation deployment, in particular in terms of co-location of sites, data base and modelling activities thatthe OZCAR network plan to address in the next years...|$|R
