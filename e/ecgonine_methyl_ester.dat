50|$|Cocaethylene is the {{byproduct}} of concurrent {{consumption of alcohol}} and cocaine as metabolized by the liver. Normally, metabolism of cocaine produces two primarily biologically inactive metabolites—benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester.</b> The hepatic enzyme carboxylesterase {{is an important part}} of cocaine's metabolism because it acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of cocaine in the liver, which produces these inactive metabolites. If ethanol is present during the metabolism of cocaine, a portion of the cocaine undergoes transesterification with ethanol, rather than undergoing hydrolysis with water, which results in the production of cocaethylene.|$|E
50|$|Cocaine is {{extensively}} metabolized, {{primarily in}} the liver, with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of benzoylecgonine (BE), the major metabolite, and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (EME) and ecgonine. Further minor metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine, p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine. If consumed with alcohol, cocaine combines with alcohol in the liver to form cocaethylene. Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more euphoric, and has a higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine by itself.|$|E

50|$|Urine {{drug test}} kits are {{available}} as on-site tests, or laboratory analysis. Urinalysis {{is the most}} common test type and used by federally mandated drug testing programs and is considered the Gold Standard of drug testing. Urine based tests have been upheld in most courts for more than 30 years. However, urinalysis conducted by the Department of Defense has been challenged for reliability of testing the metabolite of cocaine. There are two associated metabolites of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZ) and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (EME), the first (BZ) is created by the presence of cocaine in an aqeous solution with a pH greater than 7.0, while the second (EME) results from the actual human metabolic process. The presence of EME confirms actual ingestion of cocaine by a human being, while the presence of BZ is indicative only. BZ without EME is evidence of sample contamination, however, the US Department of Defense has chosen not to test for EME in its urinalysis program.|$|E

C. acidovorans MBLF was found to possess an inducible cocaine esterase which catalyzed the hydrolysis of cocaine to <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> and benzoate.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of human urinary metabolites as biomarkers in wastewater streams {{has been used}} to estimate the rates of illicit drug use in the wider community. The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester.</b> The activated sludge modelling framework for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these compounds is considered. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

The method is reproducible (cocaine, CV = 8 %; BZE, CV = 14 %) and the detection limit fo...|$|E
40|$|The aril {{extracts}} {{of three}} Thai banana varieties, namely “Kluai Khai”(KK), “Kluai Namwa”(KN) and “Kluai Hom”(KH) {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS data were used to identify 5 <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> of each banana extract after transesterification. The most prominent components found in KK, KN and KH were hexadecanoic acid <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (43. 17, 29. 18, 30. 57 % respectively), 9, 12, 15 -octadecatrienoic acid <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (35. 93, 30. 46, 39. 68 % respectively), 9, 12 -octadecadienoic acid <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (14. 35, 36. 10, 21. 82 % respectively), 9 -hexadecanoic acid <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (3. 76, 3. 34, 3. 32 % respectively) and octadecanoic acid <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> (2. 79, 0. 92, 4. 60 % respectively). The antioxidant activity of the crude oils was evaluated using DPPH method...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparative analysis}} of transport and thermodynamic properties of biodiesel fuels and components of these fuels is presented. Five types of biodiesel fuels are considered: Palm <b>Methyl</b> <b>Ester,</b> produced from palm oil; Hemp <b>Methyl</b> <b>Esters,</b> produced from hemp {{oil in the}} Ukraine and European Union; Rapeseed oil <b>Methyl</b> <b>Ester,</b> produced from rapeseed oil in the Ukraine; and Soybean oil <b>Methyl</b> <b>Ester,</b> produced from soybean oil. Up to 16 components (<b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> in most cases) of these fuels are considered. The results are applied {{to the analysis of}} biodiesel fuel droplet heating and evaporation in conditions relevant to internal combustion engines, using the model described elsewhere...|$|R
