50|$|Musices poeticae is a <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>composition.</b> It focuses {{primarily}} on counterpoint, and includes nine chapters, which cover topics {{as diverse as}} the definition of music, the definition of sound, intervals which are concords and discords, the proper succession of Consonance and dissonance, musical modes, cadences, composed versus improvised counterpoint, and proper techniques of composition for differing numbers of voices. The most famous chapter is the 7th, with its unique list of specific musical devices which can be used to express different feelings. It is the first in a German Baroque tradition of comparison of musical devices with rhetorical devices, an idea which was to be later expanded by Joachim Burmeister and Mattheson.|$|E

40|$|The {{compositions}} of asteroids {{are relevant}} {{not only to}} investigations {{of the evolution of}} the solar system and estimations of their potential to wreak devastation on impacting the Earth, but also to considerations of their value to asteroid miners. Reflection spectroscopy provides a <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>composition</b> but the spectra of metal-­‐rich asteroids are largely featureless, which makes it difficult to identify them. Therefore, only a few metal-­‐rich near-­‐Earth asteroids have been identified to date.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to develop a XYθZ 3 -DOF {{nanopositioning}} stage with linear displacement amplification device.

Overall design uses the finite element software ANSYS 12. 0 to analysis the displacement, stress and dynamic response of nanopositioning stage.

5000|$|In their book, The Viewpoints Book: A Practical <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> Viewpoints and <b>Composition,</b> Anne Bogart and Tina Landau {{identify}} the primary Viewpoints as those relating to Time - which are Tempo, Duration, Kinesthetic Response, and Repetition - and those relating to Space - which are Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Spatial Relationship and Topography. In addition, Bogart and Landau have added the Vocal Viewpoints which include Pitch, [...] Volume, and Timbre. In the book, the authors outline {{the basics of}} the Viewpoints training they both espouse as well as specific methods for applying the Viewpoints to both rehearsals and production. For Bogart and Landau, the Viewpoints represent not only a physical technique but also a philosophical, spiritual, and aesthetic approach to many aspects of their work.

40|$|Diffusion {{kinetics}} generally obey scaling relationships — {{the most}} important is that the diffusion distance x scales with √ t. Thus, if a given process takes 100 s in a material of thickness 1 mm, in a material 3 mm thick it will take 900 s. • A very useful “rule of thumb ” in diffusion problems is that for many processes, x 2 = 4 Dt is a good approximation. Thus, if one knows D and wants to know {{how long it will take}} a species to diffuse 100 µm, one can estimate the time by calculating t = x 2 /(4 D). • Phase diagrams are often essential in understanding diffusional processes that can be expected to occur in processes like the application of coatings where one material might be joined to something quite different. The phase diagram will indicate what, if any, intermediate phases might form, and also provide a very good <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> the <b>compositions</b> of phases that form. Knowledge of the phase diagram allows boundary conditions to the diffusion equation to be specified, and thus enables quantitative modeling of kinetic processes involving multiple phases. • A material’s structure has a great influence on diffusion kinetics and the various atomistic mechanisms are quite well understood for most materials. The most important mechanisms in crystalline materials are the interstitial and vacancy mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|A {{major focus}} of current work in {{distributional}} models of semantics is to construct phrase representations compositionally from word representations. However, the syntactic contexts which are modelled are usually severely limited, a fact which {{is reflected in the}} lexical-level WSD-like evaluation methods used. In this paper, we broaden the scope of these models to build sentence-level representations, and argue that phrase representations are best evaluated in terms of the inference decisions that they support, invariant to the particular syntactic constructions used <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>composition.</b> We propose two evaluation methods in relation classification and QA which reflect these goals, and apply several recent compositional distributional models to the tasks. We find that the models outperform a simple lemma overlap baseline slightly, demonstrating that distributional approaches can already be useful for tasks requiring deeper inference. ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> the <b>composition</b> of {{the enigmatic}} f 0 (980) and a 0 (980) states is their {{formation}} in φ-radiative decays. Precision data are becoming {{available from the}} KLOE experiment at the DAΦNE machine at Frascati, as well as results from SND and CMD- 2 at VEPP- 2 M at Novosibirsk. We show how the coupling of the f 0 (980) to this channel can be extracted from these, independently of the background provided by σ production. To do this we use {{the fact that the}} behaviour of both the f 0 (980) and σ cannot be determined by these data alone, but is strongly constrained by experimental results from other hadronic processes as required by unitarity. We find that the resulting coupling for the φ → γf 0 (980) is ∼ 10 − 4 GeV with a background that is quite unlike that assumed if unitarity is neglected. This provides an object lesson in how unitarity teaches us to add resonances. Not surprisingly the result is crucially dependent on the pole position of the f 0 (980), for which there are still sizeable uncertainties. At present this leads to an uncertainty in the φ → γf 0 branching ratio which can only be fixed by further precision data on the f 0 (980). Nevertheless, the BR(φ → γf 0) is now the same order of magnitude as the experimental BR(φ → γa 0) ...|$|R

Then, we develop general rules <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> service <b>composition</b> satisfying secure information flow requirements. Finally, to achieve efficient service composition, we develop a three-phase protocol to allow rapid filtering of candidate compositions that are unlikely to satisfy the information flow constraints and thorough evaluation of highly promising candidates.
