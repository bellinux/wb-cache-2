5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had <b>done</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has <b>done</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Party of Canada has <b>done</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the Maritimes in {{the past}} because of its interventionist policies. The Acadian Peninsula region of New Brunswick, long {{dependent}} upon seasonal employment in the Gulf of St. Lawrence fishery, tends {{to vote for the}} Liberals or NDP for this reason. In the 1997 federal election, Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien's Liberals endured a bitter defeat to the PCs and NDP in many ridings as a result of unpopular cuts to unemployment benefits for seasonal workers, as well as closures of several Canadian Forces Bases, the refusal to honour a promise to rescind the Goods and Services Tax, cutbacks to provincial equalization payments, health care, post-secondary education and regional transportation infrastructure such as airports, fishing harbours, seaports, and railways. The Liberals held onto seats in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, while being shut out of Nova Scotia entirely, the second time in history (the only other time being the Diefenbaker sweep). In 2015 the Liberals won every seat in The Maritimes, defeating Conservative and NDP incumbents.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead of Eurogamer {{wrote in}} {{conclusion}} that the game doesn't propose [...] "anything particularly inventive" [...] and instead ends up with a toy box of gadgets.
