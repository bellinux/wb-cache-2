40|$|The flow {{focusing}} principle {{has recently}} been shown to successfully generate micrometer viscoelastic jets. In this technique, the liquid jet is gently extruded by the smooth suction caused by the acceleration in the discharge orifice of a coflowing gas stream. Nozzle clogging is a rare phenomenon in flow focusing because the emitted jet is much thinner than all the passages and orifices in the device. The Weber number characterizing the jet is very small, which reduces the liquid impact velocity when it is printed onto a substrate. In this article, we report the design, build, and characterization, for the first time, of a flow focusing ejector. Using an aqueous polyacrylamide solution, we examine the dependence of the diameter and velocity of the jet upon the <b>ejector</b> <b>control</b> parameters: injected flow rate, applied pressure drop, and distance from the discharge orifice. Moreover, we also study the deposition onto a glass substrate moving at a constant speed, {{paying attention to the}} influence that this parameter has over the printing quality. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the flow focusing ejector by printing lines of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) and polyvinylpyrrolidone, fluids commonly used in flexible electronics and tissue engineering, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Expansion work {{recovery}} by two-phase ejector {{is known to}} be beneficial to vapor compression cycle performance. However, {{one of the biggest challenges}} with ejector vapor compression cycle is that the ejector cycle performance is sensitive to working condition changes which are common in real world applications. Different working conditions require different ejector geometries to achieve maximum performance. Slightly different geometries may result in substantially different COPs under the same conditions. Ejector motive nozzle throat diameter (motive nozzle restrictiveness) is one of the key parameters that can significantly affect COP. This paper presents a new motive nozzle restrictiveness control mechanism for two-phase ejectors used in vapor compression cycles, which has the advantages of being simple, potentially less costly and less vulnerable to clogging. The new control mechanism can possibly avoid the additional frictional losses of previously proposed <b>ejector</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms using adjustable needle. The redesigned ejector utilizes an adjustable vortex at the motive inlet to control the nozzle restrictiveness on the flow expanded in the motive nozzle. An adjustable nozzle based on this new control mechanism was designed and manufactured for experiments with R 134 a. The experimental results showed that, without changing the nozzle geometry, the nozzle restrictiveness on the two-phase flow can be adjusted over a wide range. Under the same inlet and outlet conditions, the mass flow rate through the nozzle can be reduced by 36 % of the full load. This feature could be very useful for the future application of ejector in mobile or stationary systems under changing working conditions...|$|E

40|$|Prevailing {{high-speed}} air-breathing {{propulsion systems}} invariably banks on coaxial jets which plays a vigorous role in stabilization of flames and combustion emission. Coaxial jets have applications in supersonic <b>ejectors,</b> noise <b>control</b> techniques and enhancement of mixing. Coaxial jet nozzles regulate spreading rates by developing virtuous mean flow and shortening primary flow potential core length. In the present paper, two-dimensional coaxial jet profiles of different area ratios are designed and analyzed. The models were designed in ANSYS Design Modeler and the numerical simulation {{was done in}} ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5 using the two dimensional density based energy equation and k- Îµ turbulence model with primary supersonic flow and secondary subsonic flow. The contours of turbulence intensity, acoustics power level and axial-velocity are investigated along the flow direction.

40|$|The best {{main engine}} for an {{advanced}} STOVL aircraft flight demonstrator was studied. The STOVL aircraft uses ejectors powered by engine bypass flow together with vectored core exhaust to achieve vertical thrust capability. Bypass flow and core flow are exhausted through separate nozzles during wingborne flight. Six near term turbofan engines were examined for suitability for this aircraft concept. Fan pressure ratio, thrust split between bypass and core flow, and total thrust level {{were used to}} compare engines. One of the six candidate engines was selected for the flight demonstrator configuration. Propulsion related to this aircraft concept was studied. A preliminary candidate for the aircraft reaction control system for hover attitude control was selected. A mathematical model of transfer of bypass thrust from ejectors to aft directed nozzle during the transition to wingborne flight was developed. An equation to predict ejector secondary air flow rate and ram drag is derived. Additional topics discussed include: nozzle area <b>control,</b> <b>ejector</b> to engine inlet reingestion, bypass/core thrust split variation, and gyroscopic behavior during hover...|$|R
40|$|Ejector {{refrigeration}} is {{a promising}} {{technology for the}} integration into solar driven cooling systems because of its relative simplicity and low initial cost. The major drawback of such a system is associated to its relatively low coefficient of performance (COP) under variable operating conditions. In order to overcome this problem, an advanced ejector was developed that changes its geometrical features depending on the upstream and downstream conditions. This paper provides a short overview of the development process and results of a small cooling capacity (1. 5 kW) solar driven cooling system using a variable geometry ejector. During the design steps, a number of theoretical works have been carried out, including {{the selection of the}} working fluid, the determination of the geometrical requirements and prototype design. Based on the analysis, R 600 a was selected as working fluid. A prototype was constructed with two independent variable geometrical factors: the area ratio and the nozzle exit position. A test rig was also assembled in order to test the <b>ejector</b> performance under <b>controlled</b> laboratory conditions and to elaborate a control algorithm for the variable geometry. Ejector performance was assessed by calculation of cooling cycle COP, entrainment ratio and critical back pressure. The results show that for a condenser pressure of 3 bar, an 80 % increase in the COP was obtained when compared to the performance of a fixed geometry ejector. Experimental COP values varied between 0. 4 and 0. 8, depending on operating conditions. Currently the cooling cycle is being integrated into a solar driven demonstration site for long term in situ assessment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} modelling-based design, {{operation}} {{and control of}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) hybrid systems. Fuel cells are a promising approach to high-efficiency power generation, as they directly convert chemical energy to electric work. High-temperature fuel cells such as the SOFC can be integrated in gas turbine processes, which further increases the electrical efficiency to values up to 70 %. However, {{there are a number}} of obstacles for safe operation of such a system, such as fuel cell damage through thermal loads or undesired chemical reactions, or gas turbine problems related to high thermal capacity and volume of the pressurised components. Development of suitable plant design as well as operation and control strategies is hence a key task for realisation of the mentioned systems. The first part of the thesis describes the utilised models. All component models that have been developed and applied for the work are mathematically defined based on a fixed pattern. The thermodynamically most relevant components are tubular SOFC, indirect internal reformer and heat exchangers, and spatially discretised models are used for these. For the turbomachinery, map-based steady-state behaviour is modelled. Gas residence times and pressure drops are accounted for in all components they are relevant. Based on the component models, three different hybrid cycles are examined. In the first cycle, the SOFC replaces the combustion chamber of a recuperated single-shaft turbine. The SOFC is pressurised and the cycle is called âdirectly integrated SOFC cycleâ (DIC). Further cycle options are a DIC with a two-shaft gas turbine (DIC- 2 T) and an indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC). In the latter, the compressed gas is heated recuperatively with the exhaust gas and the SOFC is operated at ambient pressure by connecting its air inlet to the turbine exhaust. All cycles incorporate the SOFC system design proposed by Siemens-Westinghouse, including indirect internal reforming, a tubular SOFC bundle and anode recirculation by an ejector. The first cycle (DIC) is regarded as standard cycle. Objectives for highly efficient, safe system design are formulated and design parameters are associated. A design calculation determines the design parameters for the standard cycle, based on a nominal power output of 220 kW. The design LHVbased electric efficiency is app. 63 %. Related to the design point, steady-state part-load ability of the system is analysed and displayed in two-dimensional performance maps where each axis represents one degree of freedom. Degrees of freedom considered are fuel and air flow; fuel utilisation is assumed constant. A result is that a strategy with constant mean fuel cell temperature is most advantageous in terms of safe and gentle operation. Further advantages of this strategy are the ability for low part-load and high efficiency at part-load operation. A control strategy is derived for dynamical implementation of the found part-load strategy. The system power output is primarily controlled by the SOFC power. The fuel utilisation is kept within certain bounds and the fuel flow is manipulated to control it to its design value. The fuel cell temperature is controlled by the air flow, which again is controlled by manipulating the GT shaft speed through the generator power. To determine the required air flow, a mixed feedforward and feedback strategy is used, where the feedforward part calculates a prediction based on the net power output and the feedback part provides correction based on the measurement of the SOFC fuel outlet temperature. Additional constraints to the control system are the supervision of the shaft speed and the valid operation regime of the anode recirculation <b>ejector.</b> The proposed <b>control</b> strategy provides robust control. The mean SOFC temperature, however, shows large transient deviation upon large load steps. The time to reach the setpoint power for large load steps is up to 70 s, while small load steps are followed in typically 1 - 2 s. A conclusion is that the system is suitable for load following operation as long as small load steps occur, as for example in distributed power generation for residential applications. Shutdown and startup strategies are introduced where the gas turbine provides air for cooling/heating throughout the procedures. Additional equipment and piping such as an auxiliary burner, a turbine exhaust throttle, a bypass around the recuperative heat exchanger as well as nitrogen and hydrogen supply and mixing units are required. Therewith, smooth cooling/heating of the cell can be accomplished without external electric power, but with a considerable amount of fuel and flushing nitrogen required. A further analysis investigates fuel flexibility of a system designed for methane: Hydrogen can be utilised without larger system modifications; only the control system characteristics must be adapted. Because no endothermic steam reforming takes place, the power output is, however, reduced to 70 % of the original value, and efficiency is reduced to 55 %. Applying the additional equipment required for shutdown/startup, the power can be increased to 94 % of the original value, although at a further efficiency decrease. In order to use ethanol as fuel in the ejector-driven anode, a recuperative vaporiser must be applied in the fuel channel. Supposed that reliable reforming catalysts for ethanol can be provided, 88 % of the original power output can be achieved at a high efficiency of 62 %. The investigation of the other cycle options reveals that a two turbine cycle where the power turbine is rotating at constant speed, mostly differs in terms of controllability. For controlling the air flow, another handle such as variable inlet guide vanes or air bypass around the SOFC system is required. The indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC) has a significantly lower efficiency of only 56 %, assuming the SOFC at the same temperature level than in the DIC.
