5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} <b>extended</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough <b>extended</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A trough <b>extended</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico to {{the western}} Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
