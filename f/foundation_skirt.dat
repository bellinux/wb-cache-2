40|$|Shallow skirted {{foundations}} can mobilize uplift {{resistance from}} end bearing {{in the short}} to medium term. However, uncertainty exists over the magnitude of reverse end bearing resistance compared with resistance in compression, and how this might be affected by {{a gap between the}} external face of the <b>foundation</b> <b>skirt</b> and the adjacent soil. The study presented in this paper explores this problem through centrifuge model tests, investigating the effect of skirt embedment ratio on (i) the magnitude of reverse end bearing capacity compared with compression capacity, (ii) the uplift displacement associated with spontaneous loss of suction during uplift, and (iii) the existence of a vertical gap along the external skirt-soil interface. The results show that (i) peak uplift capacity equivalent to compression capacity can be mobilized for a fully sealed foundation with an intact skirt-soil interface, (ii) suction required for reverse end bearing can be maintained through considerable foundation displacement, even for a low skirt embedment ratio, and (iii) the presence of a vertical gap along the external skirt-soil interface causes abrupt loss of suction beneath the top plate after minimal foundation displacement, with subsequent uplift capacity being markedly reduced. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Skirted</b> <b>foundation</b> is one {{in which}} {{vertical}} or inclined wall surrounds one or more sides of the soil mass beneath the footing. <b>Skirted</b> <b>foundation</b> is an alternative approach required for improving the bearing capacity of raft foundation by using “structural skirts ” fixed to the edges of the raft foundation. Construction of vertical skirts {{at the base of the}} raft foundation confines the underlying soil and generates a soil resistance on skirt side that helps the footing to resist sliding. The present work focused on the analysis of two sided and one sided skirted raft with and without vertical skirt using a finite element software PLAXIS 2 D. The studied parameters include the raft sizes,skirt depth and then compared with those of raft without vertical skirt. The results indicated that using structual <b>skirts</b> for raft <b>foundation</b> has a significant effect in improving the bearing capacity. This improvement increases with the skirt depth with varying raft sizes for two sided raft <b>foundation</b> vertical <b>skirt</b> with decrease in settlement. Whereas in one sided raft <b>foundation</b> with vertical <b>skirt</b> there is increase in both bearing capacity and settlement.

The aim of the experiments was to compare the undrained response of different offshore foundations to the same loading conditions. Two different types of foundation were targeted for investigation: spudcans and suction caissons. The spudcan, typically an inverted shallow cone, is the traditional footing for mobile drilling units (also known as jack-up rigs).

40|$|<b>Skirted</b> <b>foundations</b> {{are used}} in {{offshore}} applications to resist the large horizontal and moment loads that are characteristic of the ocean environment. The ultimate capacity of a <b>skirted</b> <b>foundation</b> subjected to vertical-horizontal-moment (VHM) loading combinations can be described using failure envelopes in VHM load space. This represents a far more versatile design approach than classical bearing capacity solutions {{and is able to}} accommodate complex loading scenarios and similarly complex stress conditions in the soil. Typically, VHM envelopes are constructed using deterministic plastic limit analyses or numerical methods. However, soil is a natural material and as such is inherently variable.

In this study, the ultimate capacity of a <b>skirted</b> <b>foundation</b> in spatially variable undrained clay under VHM loading is investigated. Spatial variation is taken into account using a random field representation of undrained shear strength and the increase of strength with depth typical of a normally consolidated marine clay is considered. The random field is coupled with a finite element method to assess the ultimate limit state. The failure mechanism and ultimate capacity are consequently direct results of the spatial variation of undrained shear strength. Monte Carlo simulation is used to produce probabilistic failure envelopes, based on the probability that the true combination of VHM loads causing failure will fall inside on or inside that envelope. Hence, this method allows designers to select a failure envelope that is associated with an acceptable level of risk...|$|R

40|$|Large-deformation finite-element {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to model the undrained response of <b>skirted</b> shallow <b>foundations</b> in uplift and compression. Large-deformation effects involve changes in embedment ratio and operative local soil shear strength with increasing foundation displacement-either in tension or compression. Centrifuge model testing has shown that these changes in geometry affect the mobilized bearing capacity and the kinematic mechanisms governing failure in undrained uplift and compression. Small-strain finite-element analysis cannot by definition capture the effects of changing foundation embedment ratio and variation in local soil strength with foundation displacement.

As an example, the well-defined cyclic contour diagrams of Drammen clay were utilised to demonstrate how foundation response diagrams can be established. The database is accompanied by a simplified procedure to account for cyclic degradation through equivalent number of cycles, different normalised load–displacement response and variation in foundation geometry.

40|$|Numerous {{centrifugal}} modelling research programmes {{have been}} carried out at Cambridge University to observe the drained response of circular foundations on sand. In this new series of centrifugal tests, the effects of excess pore pressure under spud-can foundations of a scaled model three-leg offshore jack up structure subjected to horizontal cyclic loadings were studied. The medium dense to dense sand layer under the foundation was saturated with viscous silicone oil to ensure that the transient flow could be measured and was close to the prototype response. The viscosity of the silicone oil used was about 3 - 4 times more than required for the prototype, to investigate the possibility of inducing liquefaction. The test series has shown that macroscopic partially drained behaviour was different from that expected in the drained or undrained conditions. Observations in the centrifuge tests indicate that there was a reduction of vertical and rotational stiffness of soil when the vertical loading during a cyclic event falls below its initial value (before the start of the cyclic event). Thus, structural design methods should if possible avoid the use of a single fixity value for design. However, the centrifuge experiments have shown that despite numerous cyclic loadings at different frequencies and amplitudes, the foundation of the model jack up structure did not fail. A comparison between the performance of Ilon-skirted and rigid vertical skirted flat spuds subjected to similar cyclic loadings was carried out to deduce the effects of suction under <b>skirted</b> <b>foundations.</b> The rigid vertical <b>skirted</b> <b>foundation</b> did not have increased fixity. The non-skirted foundations settled more than the skirted ones.

There is no evidence of pore pressure building lip ill any of the events conducted in the nine tests. However, the excess pore pressure {{is a function of the}} cyclic loading amplitude, the cyclic frequency and the position under the foundation. Both double and single frequency pore pressure behaviours are present. The maximum and minimum pore pressure values do not coincide with the maximum and minimum loads. This pore pressure behaviour can be explained through the Characteristic State Concept (LlIong and Sidaller, 1981).
