40|$|Abstract. Guide rolls play an {{important}} role in controlling both the ring circularity and the stability of cold ring rolling process. However, it is difficult to predict and control the motion of the guide rolls due to the complexity of process associated with the coupled effects of multi-factors. In this paper, a reasonable controlling model of the guide rolls is proposed, and the functional relationship between the motion track of the guide rolls and their setup parameters and process ones is established, by which the guide rolls motion track can be determined. On this basis, a 3 D-FE simulation model for cold ring rolling is developed under the ABAQUS software environment and the effects of the initial position and motion track of the guide rolls on the <b>forming</b> <b>stability,</b> ring circularity, rolling force, and oscillating are investigated. Taking the <b>forming</b> <b>stability</b> and ring circularity as objects, the optimum initial position and motion track of the guide rolls are obtained...|$|R

They could show, that the combination provided high biofunctionality with improved chondrogenesis and long term local supply of TGF-β1. TGF-β1 is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis.

A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures, lending it more mechanical strength.

Such blends also have good <b>form</b> <b>stability</b> and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra, a long-lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for lipoatrophy of cheeks.

After experimenting and studying traditional sharpies and the writings of small-boat historian Howard I.

He further reasoned that the curve of side and bottom should match as much as possible to reduce turbulence. He further reasoned that the sharpie was an ideal shape for a trailer sailer with either leeboards or bilgeboards to provide lateral plane. [...] Bolger felt that the traditional sharpie shape Chapelle had documented based on traditional New England sharpies (with a slightly different chine profile) was inefficient and prone to causing steering difficulties.|$|E

40|$|Edge-glued {{panels are}} a very {{appreciated}} material, for instance used in cabinet doors or worktops in the kitchen. The surrounding climate for these products is often severe, due to large seasonal variation of the relative humidity in the indoor air. Therefore problems regarding crack formation and <b>form</b> <b>stability</b> often occurs. This paper studies how annual ring orientation of lamellas, lamella width, initial different moisture content in the panels and single lamellas with deviating moisture content are affecting <b>form</b> <b>stability</b> and crack formation of edge-glued oak panels (Quercus robur). In the study 47 test samples with different characteristics were tested in varying climate during 182 days. The relative humidity was changed approximately every 14 days in the interval 18 to 88 % and temperature 20 ˚C. The panels were measured each 7 days regarding <b>form</b> <b>stability</b> factors. The crack formation was measured {{at the beginning and}} the end of the test. The evaluation of the results show that the annual ring orientation of the lamellas will be a significant factor regarding the <b>form</b> <b>stability</b> factors width changes and cupping of the panels and also regarding the crack formation.
