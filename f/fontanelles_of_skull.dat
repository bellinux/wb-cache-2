40|$|Cleidocranial {{dysplasia}} (CCD) {{is a rare}} congenital disorder {{which affects}} the bones and teeth. CCD usually has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, however, it may appear spontaneously in some cases. The most common features seen in CCD are aplastic or hypoplastic clavicles, late closure <b>of</b> <b>fontanelle,</b> open <b>skull</b> sutures, delayed exfoliation of deciduous teeth, delayed or failed eruption of permanent teeth, and supernumerary teeth. Here, we report a case of CCD in a 17 -year-old female without any family history who presented with the complaint of missing teeth...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{frontal bone}} is ossified from two primary centers, each {{half of the}} bone ossifies from a single center which appears between 6 and 7 weeks of the fetal life and is {{situated}} above the supra orbital margin. At birth the frontal bone is composed of two pieces, separated by the inter frontal suture and also separated from the parietal bones by the diamond-shaped, membrane filled anterior fontanelle that persists until 18 months after birth, which allows development and growth {{of the brain and}} the skull. Aim: The study was designed to measure the dimensions & extent <b>of</b> anterior <b>fontanelle</b> in fetal skulls in order to assess the dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>fontanelle</b> and its related clinical significance. Materials &Methods: The anterior <b>fontanelle</b> <b>of</b> 25 fetal <b>skulls</b> was studied, in the Department of Anatomy, Kasturba Medical College, and Manipal. The mean and standard deviation of the morphometric measures were tabulated. Results: In our study, the measurements of the antero posterior & transverse chord length measurements were done both in dry <b>skull</b> & pericranium <b>of</b> the scalp. The mean and standard deviations are determined. 25 dry skulls were placed in the exact environment considering the same distance, light source & angulation and photographed.
