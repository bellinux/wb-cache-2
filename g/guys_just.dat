500|$|The Buccaneers overcame a shaky {{start in}} which they were penalized for 80 yards in the first quarter. Then, later, they had to {{overcome}} a fourth-quarter collapse {{in which they}} allowed the Colts to score 9 points that sent the Buccaneers into their first overtime game.

Lee Roy Selmon blocked an extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter that preserved the tie and led to the overtime period. The Buccaneers' ten sacks of Colts quarterback Greg Landry set a new team record. After Randy Crowder stripped the ball from Landry 1:31 into the overtime period, Neil O'Donoghue was immediately sent in to kick the game-winning 31-yard field goal.
