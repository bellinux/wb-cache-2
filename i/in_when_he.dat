5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack does not believe that the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they are trying to find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so that they could get inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{first came to}} DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck {{with the idea of}} attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> showed up at his door in Harlem asking {{for a place to}} stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E

25|$|In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in {{subsequent}} {{letters to the}} editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam, 2010) Morgan et al. were supported by some writers, criticized by others; in each case a response by Morgan et al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American Statistician. In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when {{he does have a}} choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has to make his choice) has the same value, , as the unconditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E
25|$|The main cast were {{designed}} by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima, {{who at the time}} was working on the long-running manga series Oh My Goddess!. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. There was resistance from Fujishima's editors due to his heavy work load, including his commitment to Oh My Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had ever worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property, and he was skeptical due to state the project was <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was first approached, being in a very early stage of development before story or gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place {{at a time when it}} was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant that Fujishima would be character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project by the end of 1994, with his first design being for Sakura. His initial sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears, and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right person. The positive reception of Fujishima's work, together with his understanding for the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.|$|E
25|$|Solano's Spanish column belatedly invaded Portugal on 2 December 1807 while Taranco {{occupied}} Porto on 13 December. The only {{resistance was}} {{offered by the}} governor of Valença, who refused to open his gates to the northern column. He only caved <b>in</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> found that Lisbon had fallen and the Prince Regent had fled. While the Portuguese civil authorities were generally subservient toward their occupiers, the common people were angry. When Junot raised the French flag on Lisbon's public buildings on 13 December, a riot broke out. Mounted troops were sent into the streets to disperse the mob with force. As {{one of his first}} acts, Junot disbanded the Portuguese army by discharging all its soldiers with less than one year and more than six years of service. The remainder were assigned to nine new units and most were marched to northern Germany to perform garrison duty. Two Portuguese units were employed by the French in the 2 August 1808 assault during the First Siege of Zaragoza. They were 265 men of the 5th Infantry and 288 men of the Caçadores. The Portuguese Legion fought at the Battle of Wagram in July 1809 under the command of General Cargome Logo. The Legion counted 1,471 infantry in three battalions and 133 cavalry in two squadrons. In 1812 the Portuguese troops were reorganized into three regiments and participated in the French invasion of Russia. Few of these unlucky men survived the campaign.|$|E
