Of course the riposte to this might be that metaphors matter much less than “hard facts,” and such imagery should be seen merely as helpful (even mildly humorous) conceptual shorthand for complex science. Do a few “mere words,” therefore, truly warrant special attention? Believing they do, and that this metaphor constitutes a significantly undesirable contribution to the way Western adults are being persuaded to think and talk about young people, I first offer an eclectic sampling of its use and then consider its potential influence with reference to the general role of metaphor in constructing developmental understandings...|$|E
40|$|The paper opens by generalizing {{the concept}} of 'informing science'. It then {{introduces}} some meta-scientific perspectives and a discussion of a metaphor that has considerable explanatory power. Two main schools of metascience are presented and contrasted. The difference between treating invariances in natural sciences and in social and cultural sciences is discussed. The double helix is introduced as a <b>generic</b> <b>metaphor</b> to highlight important distinctions. Highlighting new distinctions in this way can help to avoid simply assimilating them into already familiar distinctions. The paper also discusses how some metascientific perspectives and the transdisciplinary generalized concept of informing science {{can be seen as}} related. Finally, the paper argues that computerized models never keep up with continuously changing situations. However, people always have to handle the full variety of situations, including those not foreseen during requirements engineering. To address this, the paper suggests balancing requirements engineering with model transparency engineerin...|$|E

[...] both scrutinize love as being both a virus and a panacea. Though unlike one another narratively and visually, these two brief stories concern themselves foremost with {{taking a chance}} on the uncertain. Fans of efficiency take note: Director Louis Venosta of [...] "The Coriolis Effect" [...] needs a mere 10 seconds to fully entice you and {{let you know that}} allotting an hour to this black and white production is a win-win situation. At face value, [...] "The Coriolis Effect", a mediological term meaning the spinning of the earth, characterizes how an intense spin effects tornadoes. [...] "The Coriolis Effect" [...] results in a film that details the empathy and inspiration Ray and Stan find when they cross Ruby, a nonsensical but fearless wild woman, on their mission to observe the mighty Twister, a tornado. Essentially, these two men of science resolve their personal conflict through Ruby, who ultimately walks into Twister as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind. To many, the film may strike them as an eccentric of Monmartre. But to those true devotees of aesthetics and style before substance, the film embodies near perfection. Unlike many films of high artistic visions but with little heart, [...] "The Coriolis Effect" [...] epitomizes both heart and soul into a story of courage shattering skepticism and love triumphing over fear. Venosta, beyond the real of artistry, creates quick-witted and daringly enlightening dialogue, although at times it is cliché-laden by trite and <b>generic</b> <b>metaphors</b> such as [...] "a kiss to set you free" [...] and speaking of love in terms of [...] "a leap of faith." [...] The delivery by Ruby (Jennifer Rubin) tops in this five-persons-cast, speaking with conviction, certainty, and disarming, infectious humor.|$|R
40|$|Philippe Grea : Conceptual Integration and Extended Metaphor In {{relation}} to the specific question of the metaphor, a comparison between two cognitive theories - the conceptual metaphor theory (Lakoff & Johnson 1986) and the conceptual integration theory (Fauconnier & Turner 1998) - is leading us to note their similarities but also a number of existing differences. Both of these two approaches share {{the idea that a}} metaphor is based on the initial severance of two entities (conceptual domains or mental spaces), which is to be resolved in a set of conceptual mappings. However, the conceptual integration puts in place a different formal structure which outlines the dynamic aspect of the problem. As a result, its explanatory capacity reaches the innovating metaphors and the extended metaphors, contrary to the conceptual metaphor theory which is often confined to the most <b>generic</b> conventional <b>metaphors.</b> We are illustrating this advantage of the conceptual integration with an example from the Doderer's novel. Such an example would allows us also to stress the importance of the optimality principles for the constitution of the integration network and in particular, of the blending space. Gréa Philippe.
