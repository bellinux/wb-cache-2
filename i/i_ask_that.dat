Rav Soloveitchik said, [...] "The Lubavitcher Rebbe speaks and publicizes about the Mashiach and a tumult has erupted, an uproar and an outcry.

2500|$|Since Ganga had {{descended from}} heaven to earth, {{she is also}} the vehicle of ascent, from earth to heaven. As the Triloka-patha-gamini, (Skt. triloka= [...] "three worlds", patha = [...] "road", gamini = [...] "one who travels") of the Hindu tradition, she flows in heaven, earth, and the netherworld, and, consequently, is a [...] "tirtha," [...] or {{crossing}} point of all beings, the living {{as well as the}} dead. It {{is for this reason that}} the story of the avatarana is told at Shraddha ceremonies for the deceased in Hinduism, and Ganges water is used in Vedic rituals after death. Among all hymns devoted to the Ganges, there are none more popular than the ones expressing the worshipers wish to breathe his last surrounded by her waters.

I gave you facts that you can report if so choose." [...] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, [...] "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues." ...|$|E
