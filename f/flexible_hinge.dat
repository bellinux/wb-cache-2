25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully <b>flexible</b> <b>hinge</b> at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Multicellular animals {{also have}} a type of kinase closely related to Raf: this is the Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR). Vertebrates like mammals have two, paralogous KSR genes instead of one: KSR1 and KSR2. Their C-terminal kinase domain {{is very similar to}} Raf (originally called CA5 in KSR and CR3 in Raf), but the N-terminal {{regulatory}} region differs. Although they also have the <b>flexible</b> <b>hinge</b> (CA4 in KSR) and a C1 domain (CA3 in KSR) before it, KSRs entirely lack the Ras-binding domain. Instead, they have unique regulatory regions on their N-termini, originally termed CA1 ("conserved area 1") and CA2. For a long time, the structure of the CA1 domain was a mystery. However, in 2012, the structure of the CA1 region in KSR1 was solved: {{it turned out to be}} a divergent SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, supplemented with coiled-coils (CC-SAM): this is supposed to aid KSRs in membrane binding. KSRs, like Rafs, also have the twin 14-3-3 associating motifs (that depend on phosphorylation), but also possess novel MAPK-binding motifs on [...] their hinge regions. With a typical sequence Phe-x-Phe-Pro (FxFP) these motifs are important for the feedback regulation of Raf kinases in the ERK1/2 pathway. According to our current knowledge, KSRs also participate in the same pathway as Raf, although they only play an auxiliary role. With a very poor intrinsic kinase activity, they were long thought to be inactive, until their catalytic activity was finally demonstrated in recent years. But even then, they contribute only negligibly to MKK1 and MKK2 phosphorylation. The main role of KSR appears to be to provide a heterodimerization partner to Raf enzymes, greatly facilitating their activation by means of allostery. Similar phenomena [...] were described for other MAP3 kinases. ASK2, for example, is a poor enzyme on its own, and it activity appears to be tied to ASK1/ASK2 heterodimerisation.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{majority}} of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. [...] Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or grooved surface, small <b>flexible</b> <b>hinge,</b> powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back {{to the bottom of}} their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the hinge line called exhalant apertures, or backward/ dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e., ventrally). [...] A jumping scallop will usually land on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop will stay in the water column for most or all of its contractions and will travel a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than one meter off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than five meters). [...] Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several hours of rest. Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft popping sound as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). [...] Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.|$|E

50|$|A rigid graph is an {{embedding}} of a graph in a Euclidean space {{which is}} structurally rigid.

5000|$|Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg, MutM) is a trifunctional DNA base {{excision}} repair enzyme that removes {{a wide range}} of oxidation-damaged bases (N-glycosylase activity; [...] ) and cleaves both the 3'- and 5'-phosphodiester bonds of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP lyase activity;). Fpg has a preference for oxidised purines, excising oxidised purine bases such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Its AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity introduces nicks in the DNA strand, cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break {{at the site of the}} removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Fpg is a monomer composed of 2 domains connected by a <b>flexible</b> <b>hinge.</b> The two DNA-binding motifs (a zinc finger and the H2TH (helix-two-turns-helix) motifs) suggest that the oxidised base is flipped out from double-stranded DNA in the binding mode and excised by a catalytic mechanism similar to that of bifunctional base {{excision repair}} enzymes. Fpg binds one ion of zinc at the C terminus, which contains four conserved and essential cysteines.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{computational}} {{protein design}} calculations enable the evaluation and selection of protein sequences {{in the context}} of a single native structure. However many proteins natively require multiple distinct conformations for functionality.

Loop 6 in TIM is a lid with open and closed conformations that facilitate substrate binding, product diffusion, and catalysis.
