Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody.

[...] Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post opined that Akeelah's sentence [...] "Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?"

500|$|The synod at Croft held by Wiglaf in 836, which Beorhtwulf {{may have}} attended, {{was the last}} such {{conclave}} called together by a Mercian king. [...] During Beorhtwulf's reign and thereafter, the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury. [...] A charter of 840 provides evidence {{of a different kind}} concerning Beorhtwulf's relations with the church. [...] The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire. [...] The lands had come {{under the control of the}} church in Worcester, but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again. [...] In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church's right to the land, but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return: [...] "four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds, and two silver horns of four pounds ..... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> case; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church, such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester, and promised in return that he would be [...] "more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community" [...] and, in the words of historian Patrick Wormald, [...] "would not rob them in future". [...] Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find, as so much land had been granted to monasteries. [...] The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede, who in a letter to Egbert, the Archbishop of York, had complained of [...] "a complete lack of places where the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate". [...] Beorhtwulf's concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement, and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure.|$|E
2500|$|Since its discovery, {{this idea}} {{has been the}} focus of a great deal of thought, some of it confused.

2500|$|The {{boundary}} {{between science and}} pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even {{after more than a}} century of study by philosophers of science and scientists, and despite some basic agreements on the fundaments of scientific method. The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} two decades in which the niqāb has begun to be seen in Egypt's streets, the debate about whether the niqāb is {{appropriate}} has resulted in high emotional responses from society and a media storm surrounding it. These effects depict how the niqāb debate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> issue or an isolated struggle between those who wear the niqāb and the government. The debate around the niqab reflects the greater war against the threat of violent extremism which has led to a broad government crackdown and massive arrests, not only of suspected extremists but moderate Islamists. Finding schools and universities as primary sources of Islamic militancy, the government has designated education as an issue of [...] "national security" [...] and has initiated policies around the niqab to counter the threat of fundamentalism.|$|E

6000|$|To {{prove that}} this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> case, Professor Milne Edwards also gives a table showing {{the amount of}} {{variation}} in the museum specimens of six common species of lizards, also taking the head as the standard, so that the comparative variation of each part to the head is given. In the accompanying diagram (Fig. 2) the variations are exhibited by means of lines of varying length. It will be understood that, however much the specimens varied in size, if they had kept the same proportions, the variation line {{would have been in}} every case reduced to a point, as in the neck of L. velox which exhibits no variation. The different proportions of the variation lines for each species may show a distinct mode of variation, or may be merely due to the small and differing number of specimens; for it is certain that whatever amount of variation occurs among a few specimens will be greatly increased when a much larger number of specimens are examined. That the amount of variation is large, may be seen by comparing it with the actual length of the head (given below the diagram) which was used as a standard in determining the variation, but which itself seems not to have varied.[19] ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{after making}} a strong protest against anybody but a painter judging of painting, and a pathetic appeal to the {{audience}} not to be lured by the aesthetic movement into having beautiful things about them, Mr. Whistler concluded his lecture with a pretty passage about Fusiyama on a fan, and made his bow to an audience which he had succeeded in completely fascinating by his wit, his brilliant paradoxes, and, at times, his real eloquence. Of course, {{with regard to the}} value of beautiful surroundings I differ entirely from Mr. Whistler. An artist <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> fact; he is the resultant of a certain milieu and a certain entourage, and can no more be born of a nation that is devoid of any sense of beauty than a fig can grow from a thorn or a rose blossom from a thistle. That an artist will find beauty in ugliness, le beau dans l'horrible, is now a commonplace of the schools, the argot of the atelier, but I strongly deny that charming people should be condemned to live with magenta ottomans and Albert-blue curtains in their rooms in order that some painter may observe the side-lights on the one and the values of the other. Nor do I accept the dictum that only a painter is a judge of painting. I say that only an artist is a judge of art; there is a wide difference. As long as a painter is a painter merely, he {{should not be allowed to}} talk of anything but mediums and megilp, and on those subjects should be compelled to hold his tongue; it is only when he becomes an artist that the secret laws of artistic creation are revealed to him. For there are not many arts, but one art merely--poem, picture and Parthenon, sonnet and statue--all are in their essence the same, and he who knows one knows all. But the poet is the supreme artist, for he is the master of colour and of form, and the real musician besides, and is lord over all life and all arts; and so to the poet beyond all others are these mysteries known; to Edgar Allan Poe and to Baudelaire, not to Benjamin West and Paul Delaroche. However, I should not enjoy anybody else's lectures unless in a few points I disagreed with them, and Mr. Whistler's lecture last night was, like everything that he does, a masterpiece. Not merely for its clever satire and amusing jests will it be remembered, but for the pure and perfect beauty of many of its passages--passages delivered with an earnestness which seemed to amaze those who had looked on Mr. Whistler as a master of persiflage merely, and had not known him as we do, as a master of painting also. For that he is indeed one of the very greatest masters of painting is my opinion. And I may add that in this opinion Mr. Whistler himself entirely concurs.|$|E
