5|$|A chapter {{entitled}} Shashthidevyupakhyanam, appended to {{the texts}} Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana, narrates {{the tale of}} Shashthi. King Priyavrata – the son of Svayambhuva Manu (the progenitor of mankind) – and his wife Malini performed the putrakamesti yajna (a fire-sacrifice ritual to gain a son) {{in an effort to}} conceive, but after twelve years of pregnancy, a still-born son was delivered to Malini. Priyavrata set off to the cremation grounds with the corpse of his son. On his way, he saw a celestial woman dressed in white silk and jewels, riding in a heavenly chariot. She declared to Priyavrata that she was Devasena, the daughter of Brahma and wife of Skanda. She further said that she was Shashthi, foremost of the Matrikas ("Mothers") of Skanda, and had the power to grant children to devotees. She held the child <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> resurrected the infant, then began to leave for her heavenly abode, taking the child with her. Priyavrata stopped the goddess, praising her and pleading that she return his son to him. The goddess agreed on the condition that Priyavrata would initiate and propagate her worship in all three worlds: heaven, earth and the netherworld. She returned the child to the king, naming him Suvrata and declaring that he should become famous as a great, virtuous, and learned ruler. Priyavrata decreed that Shashthi should be worshipped on the sixth day of every month, as well as the sixth and twenty-first days after childbirth, and on all occasions auspicious to a child. She would be worshipped {{in the form of a}} Shaligrama stone, a Purna Ghata under a banyan tree, or an image of her on a wall.|$|E
25|$|The Mourning Athena is {{a famous}} relief {{sculpture}} dating to around 470-460 BC {{that has been}} interpreted to represent Athena Polias. Athena Polias is also represented in a Neo-Attic relief now held in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which depicts her holding an owl <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> wearing her characteristic Corinthian helmet while resting her shield against a nearby herma.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Church exhumed {{the body}} of Bernadette Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the {{presence}} of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the crucifix <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> her rosary had both oxidized, her body appeared incorrupt— preserved from decomposition. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.|$|E

500|$|Symphony in White, No. 2, {{also known}} as The Little White Girl is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows a woman in three-quarter figure standing by a fireplace with a mirror over it. She is holding a fan <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> wearing a white dress. The model is Joanna Hiffernan, the artist's mistress. [...] Though the painting was originally called The Little White Girl, Whistler later started calling it Symphony in White, No. 2. By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasize his [...] "art for art's sake" [...] philosophy. In this painting, Heffernan wears a ring on her ring finger, even though the two were not married. By this religious imagery, Whistler emphasizes the aesthetic philosophy behind his work.|$|E
500|$|Character {{witnesses}} in 18th-century English trials were, according to author Douglas Hay, [...] "extremely important, and very frequently used ... in character testimony too, {{the word of}} a man of property had the greatest weight. [...] Judges respected the evidence of employers, farmers and neighboring gentlemen, not mere neighbors and friends." [...] The jury were apparently unimpressed by the defence's case and pronounced both defendants guilty. [...] They were sentenced on 26February; Wells would be branded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> spend six months in prison. [...] For stealing Canning's stays, Squires was to be hanged. [...] By March 1753 pamphlets on Canning's story were being read in the coffee-houses of London. [...] There was widespread outrage over Squires' treatment of her, exacerbated when Little Jemmy, [...] "a poor man who cries sticks about the streets" [...] was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies. [...] Canning was celebrated by the mob and gentry, several of whom contributed to her purse, enabling her to move to better accommodation {{in the house of}} a Mr Marshall, a cheesemonger in Aldermanbury.|$|E

500|$|It {{takes its}} name from the statues of saintly royalty which form part of its decoration, and is the oldest work in churrigueresque style in Mexico, taking 19years to complete. [...] At the bottom, from left to right, are six female royal saints: Saint Margaret of Scotland, Helena of Constantinople, Elisabeth of Hungary, Elizabeth of Aragon, Empress Cunegunda and Edith of Wilton. In the middle of the altar are six canonized kings, four of whom are: Hermenegild a Visigoth martyr, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, Edward the Confessor and Casimir of Poland. [...] Above these four are Saints Louis of France and Ferdinand III of Castile. [...] In between these kings an oil {{painting}} of the Adoration of the Magi by Juan Rodriguez Juarez shows Jesus as the King of kings. The top portion features a painting of the Assumption of Mary as celestial queen flanked by oval bas reliefs, one of Saint Joseph carrying the infant Jesus and the other of Saint Teresa of Ávila with a quill <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the Holy Spirit above her, inspiring her to write. Above this are figures of Jesus and Mary among sculptures of angels crowned with an image of God, the Father.|$|E
500|$|Artwork {{dating back}} to the Diocletian period (286-305 AD) in Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily, {{excavated}} by Gino Vinicio Gentili in 1950-60, depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor. The images of ten women, dubbed the [...] "Bikini Girls", exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today, are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site. In the artwork [...] "Coronation of the Winner" [...] done in floor mosaic in the Chamber of the Ten Maidens (Sala delle Dieci Ragazze in Italian) the bikini girls are depicted weight-lifting, discus throwing, and running. Some activities depicted have been described as dancing, as their bodies resemble dancers rather than athletes. Coronation in the title of the mosaic comes from a woman in a toga with a crown <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> one of the maidens holding a palm frond. Some academics maintain that the nearby image of Eros, the primordial god of lust, love, and intercourse, was added later, demonstrating the owner's predilections and strengthening the association of the bikini with the erotic. Similar mosaics have been discovered in Tellaro in northern Italy and Patti, another part of Sicily. Prostitution, skimpy clothes and athletic bodies were related in ancient Rome, as images were found of female sex workers exercising with dumbbells/clappers and other equipment wearing costumes similar to the Bikini Girls.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Hugh Hefner {{unexpectedly}} noticed {{photographs that}} Bill Kobrin had taken of Jayne Mansfield {{and asked him}} to shoot her centerfold for Playboy. In June of that year, photos in which she appeared naked on the set of the film Promises! Promises! were used in a series of photographs that were published in a Playboy pictorial (titled The Nudest Jayne Mansfield). The pictorial was printed with a description that went, [...] "enjoying the luxuries of a bubble bath and a double bed". It included pictures that shows Mansfield staring at her breast, as does T.C. Jones (Babbette, a female impersonator hair stylist), then grasping it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> lifting it high. That issue of the magazine was banned, and publisher Hugh Hefner was arrested by the Chicago police in June 1963; {{it was the only time}} in his life that Hefner was ever arrested. The trial resulted in a hung jury that voted 7 to 5 for acquittal. Copies of the issue reportedly sold for as much as $10 each. Since that Jayne Mansfield fiasco, Playboy was scrutinized by the Customs Department issue-by-issue until 1967, and they found 51 issues out of 51 objectionable. The heavy publicity of Promises! Promises! in the July 1963 issue of Playboy and advanced blurbs on Playboy put Mansfield's name out as a major box office draw, though reviews of the film were next to disastrous.|$|E

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

2500|$|Tony {{is renowned}} for his {{juvenile}} {{sense of humor}} and [...] "commitment phobias" [...] while Ziva is characterized as [...] "a tease" [...] early on, a factor that de Pablo enjoyed playing [...] "because [...] so not that in real life". Some aspects of Ziva's personality disturb him, such as the fact that she sleeps with a gun <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> snores very loudly. However, as co-workers, they respect each other despite their frequent exchange of sarcastic remarks. Both have had a string of failed romances.|$|E

2500|$|Yahoo!'s Shine {{lifestyle}} website {{said the}} show contained cruelty and elements of humiliation, {{and that some}} critiques from the judges are [...] "really cruel and cringe-inducing", claiming that the show [...] "humiliates and degrades young women." [...] The site created the list [...] "10 reasons why 'America's Next Top Model' is bad for women, humans", citing such things as giving the contestants and women viewers unrealistic visions {{of life as a}} model, and [...] "always espousing empowerment and female strength and then forcing the contestants into embarrassing scenarios far outside the realm of real-life modeling". One such scenario highlighted was when cycle 12's final two contestants [...] "were made to wear bikinis so skimpy that the producers had to blur out Allison Harvard's butt cheeks", and performed a [...] "creepily sexual mud fight," [...] after which contestant and winner Teyona Anderson was [...] "commended for taking her weave <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> whipping it around on the runway like a sexy feather boa." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jamie and Rachel {{are taken}} home; Darlene and Richard, who have arrived home, console the girls. As Darlene goes upstairs to run Jamie a bath, she is {{suddenly}} attacked by Jamie, {{who has had}} the evil passed on to her by Michael. Loomis hears Darlene's screams and races halfway up the stairs before he stops dead in his tracks. He sees the horrific sight of Jamie, still in her clown costume (similar to what Michael wore when he killed his sister) standing {{at the top of}} the stairs, wearing a clown mask, holding a pair of scissors <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> stained with blood. Loomis then starts screaming, [...] "No!" [...] over and over again, backing against the wall and raising his gun to shoot her. Sheriff Meeker stops Loomis and disarms him, taking the gun into his own hands before he, Mr. Carruthers, and Rachel also see the horror that Loomis saw. Loomis slowly sinks to the floor, sobbing as Rachel, Richard, and Sheriff Meeker stare in horror. Jamie is now consumed by Michael's rage.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{culminates in}} a {{competition}} at the [...] "Gas Station" [...] comedy club where Steven, Lilah and other aspiring comedians have been performing. A judges panel of television executives promise the winner a prime time opportunity and possible stardom. As they compete on stage, the characters also grapple with conflicts among their desires for success on stage, their loyalties to one another, and the expectations of their families. Pending the judges' final tally, with a note of support from her husband <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> hearing Steven has {{only two of the}} five judges' votes, Lilah withdraws [...] "in case the winner is me" [...] and persists in leaving when the club owner reveals she was in fact the winner. She leaves with her husband who, after watching his wife do stand-up for the first time, is won over and begins suggesting ideas for her next set. The pair walk away arm in arm reminiscing about the funny and endearing sayings of their children. Inside, Steven is declared the winner of the show, which reflects Lilah's judgment and that of their competing fellow comics.|$|E

2500|$|By 1942 {{she was a}} star in the Chicago area, {{performing}} at the Rhumboogie Club. The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa. [...] A year later, the future owner of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, heard her sing in Washington DC and wrote in his memoirs:"1943, I was about 19 years old; I went to a nightclub in the northeast black district of Washington DC and heard a singer named Little Miss Cornshucks and thought: 'Oh God!' She was better than anything I had heard so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a basket <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> so on; but she could sing the blues better than anyone I've heard to date. That night I asked her if I could record a record with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the song So Long. She had such a wonderful sound and I remember how I always thought, 'Oh my God, and I have no record company; I can make the drive just for myself.'" [...] "So Long" [...] became her signature tune and a regional hit in 1943 for the short-lived Sunbeam label.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{images of}} Durga are seen {{represented}} in the temple, notably on the sanctum and also on the exterior surface of the east facing wall. The shalabhanjikas or two female dwarapalakas guard the doorway, which {{are also in the}} form of the Goddess. The temple is stated to generate [...] "primal energy" [...] in consonance with the characteristics of deity of Durga; the dwarapalika on the left has a bow <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> that on the right has a sword. The sanctum depicts Durga on the back wall standing on a lotus, in what is termed as [...] "sambhaga" [...] (standing) posture with four hands, with the upper hands carrying a shankha and a chakra and one lower hand is in an abhaya mudra (posture of a blessing) and the other hand is on hip. The ornament worn is a breast-band without any halter straps. She is surrounded by devotees with a devotee on her left about to decapitate himself as an offering (in another version it is inferred as a flower offering by the devotee), and another devotee (with tied tresses exposing his neck to be cut} on her right mutilating his body parts, also in offering; this was a Hindu rite associated with the Kapalikas. This type of offering to a goddess, though ghastly, is seen in many Durga temples; it is related to the myth of her role as Mahisasuramardini (slayer of demon Mahishasura). Durga images in niches have depictions of the goddess standing on a buffalo head representing the Mahishasura.|$|E
