5|$|Doctor Ox's Experiment is {{an opera}} in two acts by Gavin Bryars. It has an English-language {{libretto}} by Blake Morrison after the novella {{of the same}} name by <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> It was first performed on 15 June 1998 at the London Coliseum by English National Opera (ENO) who co-commissioned the opera with BBC Television.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently {{a stream}} of famous {{visitors}} came to view Staffa's wonders including Robert Adam, Sir Walter Scott (1810), John Keats (1818), J. M. W. Turner, whose 1830 visit yielded an oil painting exhibited in 1832, William Wordsworth (1833), <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> (1839), Alice Liddell (the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland) in 1878, David Livingstone (1864), Robert Louis Stevenson (1870) and Mendelssohn himself in 1829. Wordsworth, however, found the volume of tourism disappointing.|$|E

5|$|Siti Akbari {{was written}} by Lie Kim Hok, a Bogor-born peranakan Chinese who was taught by Dutch missionaries. The missionaries {{introduced}} him to European literature, including the works of Dutch writers such as Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint and Jacob van Lennep, as well as works by French authors like <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne,</b> Alexandre Dumas, and Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez suggests that Lie may have also been influenced by Malay and Javanese oral traditions, such as the travelling bangsawan theatrical troupes or wayang puppets.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States. Several French {{landmarks}} such as the Eiffel Tower, its <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> Restaurant and the Château de Chantilly were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at Fisherman's Wharf, Dunsmuir House, San Francisco City Hall and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The Lefty O'Doul Bridge was featured in the fire engine chase scene. The horse racing scenes were shot at Ascot Racecourse.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} not {{published}} in Verne's lifetime and was presumed lost until 1978, when a handwritten copy {{was discovered in}} the Archives of the Censorship Office of the Third Republic. The text was published in France by Jean-Jacques Pauvert in 1981. An English translation by Edward Baxter was commissioned by the North American <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> Society and published in 2003 by Prometheus Books. The first production of the play after its rediscovery occurred in 2005, in a small-scale performance at the Histrio Theatre in Washington, DC.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that the crew had gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a rebuttal by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
5|$|In the new magazine's {{first year}} Reed {{was a regular}} {{contributor}} of articles and stories {{on a range of}} subjects, joining distinguished writers such as G. A. Henty, R.M. Ballantyne and <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> A prominent illustrator for the magazine was the artist and mountaineer Edward Whymper. Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a {{haphazard}} education. Her {{interest in the}} French language began with a governess who read <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> stories aloud to her so {{she would have to}} learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an accent and made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E

5|$|Development of Myst {{began in}} 1991. The game's {{creative}} team {{consisted of the}} Rand and Robyn, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and Ryan Miller, who together made up Cyan, Inc. Myst {{was not only the}} largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop. Cyan took inspiration from games like Zork, Star Wars mythic universe, portals to other worlds like in C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia, and the mysterious islands of old literature like the works of <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> The game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book The Mysterious Island by Verne.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began after {{production}} had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At {{the time of its}} release, the film had made greater use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in Atlantis, with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Paris was {{the home}} and subject for some of France's {{greatest}} writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written {{while he was in}} exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne,</b> worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E
5|$|The Shooting Star shared plot {{similarities}} with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 {{novel by}} pioneering French science-fiction writer <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> As in Hergé's story, Verne's novel features {{an expedition to}} the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé's Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne's story, {{saying that he had}} only read one of the French novelist's works; {{it is possible that the}} influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé's friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé's inspiration for Professor Calculus.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he {{was more interested in}} telling stories and learning about art than anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> ATV, or Automated Transfer Vehicle 001 (ATV-001), was an {{unmanned}} cargo resupply spacecraft {{launched by}} the European Space Agency (ESA). The ATV was named after the 19th-century French science-fiction author <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne.</b> It was launched on 9 March 2008 {{on a mission to}} supply the International Space Station (ISS) with propellant, water, air, and dry cargo. <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> was the first of five ATVs to be launched.|$|E
25|$|Because it was {{the first}} ATV to be launched, <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> {{underwent}} three weeks of orbital testing before beginning its final rendezvous with the ISS. The spacecraft docked to the ISS on 3 April 2008 to deliver its cargo. On 25 April 2008, <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> used its thrusters to reboost the station into a higher orbit. After spending just over five months docked at the station, <b>Jules</b> <b>Verne</b> undocked on 5 September 2008 and made a destructive re-entry over the Pacific Ocean on 29 September.|$|E
