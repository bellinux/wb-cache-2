Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then loanable funds do not increase, and thus a {{recession}} may be caused – but {{this is due to}} holding cash, not to saving per se. Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves – funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in liquidity trap situations, when interest rates are at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed <b>investment</b> <b>demand.</b> Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference.|$|E

The existence, uniqueness and stability conditions of the long-run eguilibrium and the dynamic properties of the factor demand are explored.

The results indicate that for both Plant and Equipment (P&E) and Research and Development (R&D),the debt-eguity ratio significantly affects the <b>investment</b> <b>demands</b> and the elasticities are highly inelastic. The effect is stronger for P&E than for R&D capital in the long run, while the effects on P&E and R&D investment are quite similar in the short run. ...|$|R

The study uses a standard model of <b>investment</b> and labour <b>demand,</b> which is augmented to include foreign wages. It is argued that this approach is the most suitable for capturing the real effects of transnational activity, since foreign wages indicate the attractiveness of alternative sites for investment, production and employment. A simultaneous equations estimator is employed and, for each industry, there is evidence that both the behaviour of <b>investment</b> and labour <b>demand</b> are sensitive to foreign wage conditions. The results indicate the extent to which transnational activity has had a real effect upon Japan's domestic machinery sector. ...|$|R

40|$|Regression models {{relating}} <b>investment</b> <b>demand</b> with firms' Tobin's q {{and cash}} flow are fraught with measurement errors which, in turn, cause endogeneity bias.
