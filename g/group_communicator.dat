40|$|Background: Clinical {{teaching}} competency is {{a professional}} necessity ensuring that clinicians’ knowledge, skills and attitudes are effectively transmitted from experts to novices. The aim {{of this paper is}} to consider how clinical skills are transmitted from a historical and reflective perspective and to link these ideas with student and teacher perceptions of competence in clinical teaching. Methods: The reflections are informed by a Delphi process and professional development survey designed to capture students’ and clinicians’ ideas about the attributes of a competent clinical teacher. In addition, the survey process obtained information on the importance and ‘teachability’ of these characteristics. Results: Four key characteristics of the competent teacher emerged from the Delphi process: clinically competent, efficient organiser, <b>group</b> <b>communicator</b> and person–centred. In a subsequent survey, students were found to be more optimistic about the ‘teachability’ of these characteristics than clinicians and scored the attribute of person-centredness higher than clinicians. Clinicians, on the other hand, ascribed higher levels of importance to clinical competency, efficient organisation and group communication than students. Conclusions: The Delphi process created a non-threatening system for gathering student and clinician expectations of teachers and created a foundation for developing methods for evaluating clinical competency. This provided insights into differences between teachers’ and students’ expectations, their importance, and professional development...|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of cores inside compute {{clusters}} continues to grow, the scalability of MPI (Message Passing Interface) is important to ensure that programs can continue to execute on an ever-increasing number of cores. One important scalability issue for MPI is the current implementation of <b>communicators</b> and <b>groups.</b> <b>Communicators</b> and <b>groups</b> {{are an integral part}} of MPI and play an essential role in the design and use of libraries. It is challenging to create an MPI implementation to support <b>communicators</b> and <b>groups</b> to scale to the hundreds of thousands of processes that are possible in today’s clusters. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of techniques to support the scalability of <b>communicators</b> and <b>groups</b> in MPI. We have designed and implemented a fine-grain version of MPI, called FG-MPI based on MPICH 2, that allows thousands of full-fledged MPI processes inside an operating system process. Using FG-MPI we can create hundreds and thousands of MPI processes, which allowed us to implement and evaluate solutions to the scalability issues associated with communicators. We describe techniques to allow for sharing of group information inside processes, which required a re-definition of the context-id and the design of scalable operations to create the communicators. A set plus permutation framework is introduced for storing group information that makes use of a variety of different representations. We also propose a set, instead of map, representation for MPI group objects that takes advantage of our framework. Performance results are given for the execution of a MPI benchmark program with upwards of 100, 000 processes with communicators created for various groups of different sizes and types. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates how {{political}} institutions affect government–media relationships. Most studies of media-politics focus on majoritarian parliamentary or presidential systems and on how party systems affect journalism. This tends to neglect important issues that pertain in more constitutionally complex democracies, {{such as the}} consociational institutions in postconflict societies. Taking the Northern Irish context as a strategic case study, we analyze data from thirty-three semistructured interviews with the actors responsible for communicating political issues in Northern Ireland: political journalists and the two <b>groups</b> of government <b>communicators,</b> civil service Government Information Officers (GIOs) and Ministerial Special Advisers (SpAds). By examining their roles and relationships in this context, we demonstrate the importance of considering the institutional design of the democratic system itself when attempting to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced theory of media-politics. In Northern Ireland, {{the absence of an}} official political opposition in the legislature, together with the mandatory nature of the multiparty coalition, means that the media have come to be perceived by many political and media actors as the opposition. This in turn influences the interpersonal interactions between government and media, the way political actors try to “manage” the media, and the media’s approach to reporting government...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} {{transmitting}} {{information may be}} divided as follows: direct; and, indirect. The âdirectâ method occurs when a creature transmits a signal that other creatures in its local environment can receive. Word of mouth advertising {{is a form of}} direct communication. âIndirectâ communication relays a message through the environment. This type of communication is known as stigmergy. Both word of mouth communication and stigmergy require the existence of <b>groups</b> of <b>communicators.</b> It is, however, difficult to analyse {{a very large number of}} local interactions that occur in group behaviour. A global phenomenon known as âemergenceâ arises from such behaviour. The phrase ââthe whole is greater than the sum of its partsâ normally describes emergence. In this research, we investigate how the two methods of communicating, direct and indirect (including a combination of these), result in emergent behaviour. In order to establish this outcome we employed the use of agent-based software in which we designed groups of agents to evolve over generations in response to specific situations. The manner in which these agent groups evolve is by a genetic algorithm. This is based on the consumption and collection of resources from the environment - a metric for gauging how well the population performs as a whole. For the purpose of this dissertation, we measure and examine the performance of four styles of the two methods of communication: No Communication, Word of Mouth, Stigmergic and Both (a combination of direct and indirect). We observe the fitness arising through successive generations of agents for each of the four styles and compare the results. The âNo Communicationâ style is markedly the worst performer and is âthe sum of the partsâ in terms of the definition of emergence. The âWord of Mouthâ style is marginally below the best performer but is rated well above that of âNo Communicationâ. The âStigmergicâ style is only the third best performer. Combining the direct and indirect methods yields the best result for the âBothâ style. All the communicating categories, considered âthe wholeâ in terms of the definition for emergence, outperform the âNo Communicationâ style. This demonstrates that emergence occurs when using these communication methods in groups. Keywords: Communication, Emergence, Genetic Algorithms, Group Behaviou...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{complexity}} of modern cosmological parameter inference where {{we are faced with}} non-Gaussian data and noise, correlated systematics and multi-probe correlated data sets, the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method is a promising alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches in the case where the Likelihood is intractable or unknown. The ABC method is called "Likelihood free" as it avoids explicit evaluation of the Likelihood by using a forward model simulation of the data which can include systematics. We introduce astroABC, an open source ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for parameter estimation. A key challenge in astrophysics is the efficient use of large multi-probe datasets to constrain high dimensional, possibly correlated parameter spaces. With this in mind astroABC allows for massive parallelization using MPI, a framework that handles spawning of jobs across multiple nodes. A key new feature of astroABC is the ability to create MPI <b>groups</b> with different <b>communicators,</b> one for the sampler and several others for the forward model simulation, which speeds up sampling time considerably.

There is a tradition of studying executive function in both typical and atypical populations, and the present study investigates executive functions in children with severe speech and motor impairments who are communicating using communication aids with graphic symbols, letters and/or words. There are few neuropsychological studies of children in this group and little is known about their cognitive functioning, including executive functions. It was hypothesized that aided communication would tax executive functions more than speech. 29 children using communication aids and 27 naturally speaking children participated. Structured tasks resembling everyday activities, where the action goals had to be reached through communication with a partner, were used to get information about executive functions. The children a) directed the partner to perform actions like building a Lego tower from a model the partner could not see and b) gave information about an object without naming it to a person who had to guess what object it was. The executive functions of planning, monitoring and impulse control were coded from the children’s on-task behavior. Both groups solved most of the tasks correctly, indicating that aided communicators are able to use language to direct another person to do a complex set of actions. Planning and lack of impulsivity was positively related to task success in both groups. The aided group completed significantly fewer tasks, spent longer time and showed more variation in performance than the comparison <b>group.</b> The aided <b>communicators</b> scored lower on planning and showed more impulsivity than the comparison group, while both groups showed an equal degree of monitoring of the work progress.

5000|$|Communication {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial things in virtual teams. Communication is vital to the success of the virtual team and it is crucial that the team is a <b>group</b> of {{excellent}} <b>communicators</b> with the proper technology for the best levels of communication. [...] It starts from selecting excellent communicators for the team members and the right technology for them to use. Virtual communication technologies cause many difficulties in effective team communication, such as time delays, common reference frames, differences of interpretation, and assurance of participation for remote team members. Some empirically found challenges in successful communication in virtual teams are failure to communicate due to wrong or lacking contextual information, unevenly distributed information, interpretation of the meaning of silence and technical problems. Nonverbal communication, which is vital for team communication, is also missing in virtual teams. Traditional teams communicate more effectively than virtual teams. Difficulties often arise when some team members are co-located while others are geographically distant. There is an assumption that co-located team members communicate with each other about information that is not communicated to the distant member, which can cause friction between members. Leadership and cultural differences also substantially affect the effectiveness of communication. The frequency and predictability of communication and how much feedback is provided regularly improves the effectiveness of communication, which leads to greater team trust and improves team performance. On the other hand, inconsistent and infrequent communication reduces the coordination and success of virtual teams. One common reason is that some team members leave for a short amount of time without communicating their absence to other members. However, virtual teams are found to communicate more frequently than normal teams and female-only virtual teams have higher communication than male-only or combined gender virtual teams. Higher effective communication is shown to improve cultural understanding.|$|R
40|$|Although {{different}} patterns of political participation among self-aware minority groups have spurred much {{debate in the}} academic circles, especially in stable democracies, this issue remains understudied in the newer post-communist societies and notably so the post-conflict countries of former Yugoslavia. Much of the existing research conducted in established democracies has demonstrated that increased levels of national minority political involvement {{are directly related to}} democratic development, but that these groups are shunning more traditional forms of engagement, notably political party membership in favour of direct engagement through informal participation. Nevertheless, there is very little understanding of what national minority political participation represents in post-conflict states, as much scholarly research has termed it as underground, invisible or inexistent. Despite this, there is evidence that in these states formal political participation of national minority groups is still strong, but it remains unknown to what degree this occurs, what factors influence this behavior and to what degree is this behavior present among autochthon minority groups. As active political participation of national minorities {{plays an important role in}} the democratization and stabilization of such societies, this represents an important gap in our knowledge. This thesis aims to investigate the level of conventional political participation and the trigger factors for such engagement of two significant, yet contrasting national minority groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), namely Jews and Poles. To do this, a mixed-method approach embedded in the transformative paradigm is employed, combining qualitative and quantitative findings of fieldwork. The thesis assesses eight indicators of formal political participation and reveals whether we can observe new trends when it comes to conventional engagement of these two, but also whether their influence remains limited due to their inability to formally participate in the government. It finds that both <b>groups</b> are political <b>communicators,</b> which choose to opt out of political party membership or financial support to electoral campaigns, because they feel alienated from formal politics due to constitutional limitations. However, this exit from the highest forms of political participation is not coupled with total disengagement, as both groups are actively engaged in other forms of formal political activism. This thesis concludes that new trends of political behaviour are emerging among the two observed groups, and especially so among their youth...|$|R

The illegal introduction of GM soybeans in Brazil was an experience that has shown the importance of a solid and workable legal frameworkand the necessity of previous discussion with stakeholders - not just the ones directly linked {{to the development of the}} trait and or crop, like public research institutions, biotechnology companies, farmers, to say some, but also with consumers, consumer rights advocates, environmentalists, health professionals and media. Quantitative research conducted at the time of intense controversy in Brazil, with representative samples of the population instigated by Greenpeace, revealed broad publicrejection of GMOs. But quite a few efforts were made to understand the viewpoints of different sectors of society in relation to GM products. I had the privilege to participate in some of those few initiatives and I will share, during the presentation, the experiences acquired Aspects of public perception and communication were addressed in different formats during the development of such projects: manual for ?Problem Formulation?, stakeholders? panel, online questionnaires, semi structured interviews, among others. One experience in particular was carried out by four countries in Latin America in the context of the project LAC Biosafety (5), where environmental impacts and public perception/communication were partnered in the same project. Demand from the public consulted in the context of this project resulted in the preparation and supply of brochures, courses, training and even TV and radio programs. Among the training, those targeting media professionals sought to stimulate scientific culture - empowerment process of the general public so that they can obtain credible information on GMOs, facilitating the taking of personal decision (in its various formats). For the Brazil case-study under the LAC Biosafety umbrella, it was possible to identify and describe: common groups of attitudes toward GMOs; patterns of association between the common attitude groups and variables like socioeconomic characteristics, trust in institutions asinformation sources and familiarity with the Brazilian biosafety authority; how these variables play important rolesin defining patterns of attitudes toward GMOs; the implications of these relationships for the development of a communication strategy plan that would promote public awareness and stimulate a well-informed Brazilian public debate on biosafety. All experiences and achievements in those research projects had their impact and recently we got the opportunity to multiply the experience, adapt it and expand it to other countries - Kenya and Uganda. By sharing the experiences of Brazil and research fi ndings with those countries, it is expected that they can move forward in the decisions on GMOs in accordance with their own principles and desires, but not losing sight of the science that gives base to advance safely. Some lessons learned over our work: (*) cooperation between groups of technical and scientific research and the <b>groups</b> of <b>communicators</b> is key to effective communication of best available science; (*) the characterization of stakeholders (their desires, trust and interest) is essenti al for an effective communication plan; (*) interest groups are similar but the power structure is different for each country; (*) the understanding of the power structure is key to define the better way to assure a delivery of scientific facts for the decision-making process. Brazil has a great opportunity to lead the use of GMOs in agricultural production in their energy opti ons and other markets, such as climate issues or biomass. Legal certainty translated into accurate regulatory processes, efficient and based on the best science is the key to develop this potential...|$|R
