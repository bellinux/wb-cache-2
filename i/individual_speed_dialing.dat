5000|$|Opera 9.20 {{introduced}} [...] "Speed Dial Browsing". The {{blank page}} {{when a new}} tab is opened is replaced with a page with slots which the user can set to contain webpage bookmarks. This feature {{is based on the}} <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> browsing previously introduced in Opera Mini. New versions of Opera's <b>Speed</b> <b>Dial</b> improved the feature by allowing an unlimited number of <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> entries, <b>Speed</b> <b>Dial</b> extensions, introducing groups, real-time search of entries, added support to user-defined backgrounds and different resolution display layouts (e.g. widescreen).|$|R

50|$|Previous {{screw mount}} Leicas used two {{separate}} shutter <b>speed</b> <b>dials</b> for slow and fast speeds (the fast <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> {{on top of}} the camera rotated during firing). The M3 combined slower and faster <b>speeds</b> and the <b>dial</b> does not rotate during firing. Supposedly, this reduces vibrations in the camera. Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R

50|$|In 1980, Casablanca {{introduced}} the Slumber Quiet system, {{which had a}} pull chain switch that controlled both the fan motor and an optional light kit, and a variable <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> to adjust the fan's speed. This system was discontinued in 1985 and replaced with {{a variation of the}} system known as Slumber-Five, which had five fixed speeds controlled by a stepped potentiometer rather than a fully variable <b>speed</b> <b>dial.</b> Slumber-Five was discontinued in 1986.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>dial</b> is a {{function}} available on many telephone systems allowing the user to place a call by pressing a reduced number of keys.

50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The self timer was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter <b>speed</b> <b>dial.</b> The lock button for the shutter <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob.|$|R
