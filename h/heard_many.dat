5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E

25|$|Havergal Brian (1876 - 1972), the {{classical}} composer and music writer, who composed 32 symphonies and five operas, {{was born in}} Stoke (in Dresden).

Rumors notwithstanding, there seems to be no credible evidence that the {{leaders of the}} N/C had any confirmation of the Rogers involvement until he and Page were ready for them to know.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|During her childhood, Duchesne had <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> {{stories in}} her parish church from missionary priests {{of life in}} Louisiana, founded as a colony of New France, and had long felt a desire to serve the Native Americans who lived there. In 1817, William Dubourg, S.S., Bishop of the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, visited the convent in Paris. Bishop Dubourg {{was looking for a}} {{congregation}} of educators to help him evangelize the Indian and French children of his diocese. After meeting him, Duchesne immediately felt her old desire for missionary service revive and begged permission from Barat to serve in the bishop's diocese.|$|E

25|$|Confederate {{district}} {{courts were}} authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution, and President Davis appointed judges within the individual {{states of the}} Confederate States of America. In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling {{many of the same}} type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.|$|E
500|$|When we now <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> {{disputes}} {{about the}} inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf's will to our assembly at Langandene, {{and it was}} read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me– and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against {{any one of them}} because they declared what was right– that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. [...] "Now everything has come into your possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer." ...|$|E
500|$|The years {{preceding}} {{and following}} World War II {{proved to be}} very productive for Khachaturian. In 1939 Khachaturian made a six-month trip to his native Armenia [...] "to make a thorough study of Armenian musical folklore and to collect folk-song and dance tunes" [...] for his first ballet, Happiness which he completed in the same year. [...] "His communion with Armenia's national culture and musical practice proved for him {{as he put it}} himself, 'a second conservatoire'. He learned a lot, saw and <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> things anew, {{and at the same time}} he had an insight into the tastes and artistic requirements of the Armenian people." [...] In 1942, at the height of the Second World War, he reworked it into the ballet Gayane. It was first performed by the Kirov Ballet (today known as Mariinsky Ballet) in Perm, while Leningrad was under siege. It was a great success that earned Khachaturian a Soviet State Prize. Khachaturian returned the money of the prize to the state with a request to use it for building a tank for the Red Army.|$|E

500|$|While wrestling in Oregon, Pat Patterson <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> wrestlers {{tell him}} that he would be a natural fit as a tag team partner of Ray Stevens, who competed in San Francisco. Patterson moved to San Francisco and dyed his hair blond to match Stevens, who had used the {{nickname}} [...] "The Blond Bomber" [...] as a singles wrestler. They defeated the team of The Destroyer and Billy Red Lyons to win the San Francisco version of the AWA World Tag Team Championship on April 17, 1965. They held the belts for over {{a year and a half}} before dropping them to the Mongolian Stomper and Ciclon Negro in December 1966. They won the title back in a rematch the following month and held it for another three months. On April 8, 1967, they lost the belts to longtime rival Pepper Gomez and future World Wide Wrestling Federation Champion Pedro Morales. They continued to team together, however, until the end of the year, when Patterson left the area to compete in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Marsden first {{appeared}} on 5 March 2001 in the [...] "Who Shot Phil?" [...] storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Ian Beale and Mark Fowler. A source in the Daily Record said, [...] "Sooner or later the truth will out. But until then there's {{going to be a}} lot of probing going on." [...] She left on 27 March 2001 after unsuccessfully identifying the shooter (who turned out to be Lisa). In 2002 she appeared in January, April and from 14 November to 6 December. In November, when Marsden returns, the police suspect that Phil has murdered his ex-wife Lisa. The Daily Mirror said, [...] "They are the words Phil Mitchell has <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> times before. 'You're nicked', baldy. Intrepid DCI Marsden may not be a Jane Tennison, but she's nabbed her prime suspect. [...] "I've got some good news for you, Phil," [...] she says, after arresting him on suspicion of murder. [...] "The police in Portugal found your jacket. Unfortunately for you, it's covered in blood. Mrs Fowler's blood..." [...] In 2003, Marsden returned in March July, August, November and for a longer stint in December.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the intensity of Scottish witch-hunting was due to an inquisitorial judicial system and the widespread use of judicial torture. However, Brian P. Levack argues that the Scottish system was only partly inquisitorial and that use of judicial torture was extremely limited, similar to the situation in England. A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts, a benefit not given accused witches in England. The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts, where local magistrates <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> cases (in contrast to England where most were before a small number of circuit judges), may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution. The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases, but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions, particularly those concerned with fairies, which were more persistent in Scotland than in England. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of [...] "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.|$|E

500|$|While travelling, Nielsen {{discovered}} {{and then turned}} against Richard Wagner's music dramas, <b>heard</b> <b>many</b> of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship {{was not only a}} [...] "love match", but also a [...] "meeting of minds"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a [...] "strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.|$|E
