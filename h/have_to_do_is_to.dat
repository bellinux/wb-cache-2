2500|$|One such {{threat was}} {{delivered}} by fur trader James McDougall, who {{is quoted as}} saying to a gathering of local chiefs, [...] "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [...] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, [...] "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." [...] The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. [...] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, [...] "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [...] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.|$|E
