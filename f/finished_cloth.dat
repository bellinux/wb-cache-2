5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth.</b> At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> in Manchester.|$|E
25|$|The {{roads in}} the area {{at the time were}} very poor, and <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> had to be carried by pack horses to the nearby ports of Topsham and Exeter, or by carrier's cart to Bridgwater, Bristol and London (a twelve-day journey).|$|E

25|$|Cilician Armenia {{had become}} a prosperous state due to its {{strategic}} position on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. It was located at the juncture of many trade routes linking Central Asia and the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The kingdom was thus important in the spice trade, as well as livestock, hides, wool, and cotton. In addition, important products such as timber, grain, wine, raisins, and raw silk were also exported from the country and <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> and metal products from the West were made available.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of woollen cloth was well established {{here by the}} time of Queen Elizabeth I. It expanded rapidly after the late 18thcentury. The first textile mill was built at Dogley in about 1787 and used waterpower to prepare wool for spinning and for fulling the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth.</b> In about 1800 another mill opened at Linfit, which used steam power. Both mills gradually took on other processes and developed into substantial businesses under the Kenyon and Hey families. By 1880 there were eight mills at work in the township.|$|E

25|$|The American Civil War {{shut down}} {{many of the}} mills {{temporarily}} when they sold off their cotton stockpiles, which had become more valuable than the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> after imports from the South had stopped. Many jobs were lost, but the effect was somewhat mitigated {{by the number of}} men serving in the military. Lowell had a small historical place in the war: Many wool Union uniforms were made in Lowell, General Benjamin Franklin Butler was from the city, and members of the Lowell-based Massachusetts Sixth—Ladd, Whitney, Taylor, and Needham—were the first four Union deaths, killed in a riot while passing through Baltimore on their way to Washington, DC. Ladd, Whitney, and later Taylor are buried in front of City Hall under a large obelisk.|$|E
500|$|The canal, {{which was}} made by greatly {{deepening}} and widening the eastern section of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, opened on 1 January 1894. It reduced the shipping costs of raw cotton to the mills and the dispatching the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> overseas. [...] The canal had helped the region to become {{the centre of the}} Industrial Revolution, and it had transformed Manchester into England's third largest port, despite being [...] inland. As the canal was built, it became clear that Brindley's famous aqueduct would have to be demolished, as it allowed insufficient headroom for the freighters that the canal would carry. Fortunately, in 1896 the councillors of Eccles paid to have the aqueduct moved to the spot it occupies today, alongside the canal. The Bridgewater Canal is now carried over the Manchester Ship Canal by the equally celebrated Barton Swing Aqueduct, which was completed in 1893 with the novel idea of [...] "opening" [...] by rotating 90degrees to allow ships to pass.|$|E
500|$|The first {{plans for}} making the small River Frome, {{also known as the}} Stroudwater, navigable date back to the last three years of the 17th century. The plan was to serve the woollen industry, by {{carrying}} coal from the Severn to Stroud and transporting the <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> away to markets, but it was opposed by mill owners, and it came to nothing. The idea was revived in 1728, when John Hore, who had previously succeeded in making the River Kennett navigable, suggested a canal around [...] long, with 12 locks, suitable for 60-ton barges. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1730, with support from those who worked in the cloth industry, but opposition from some of the millers, but it seemed to ignore Hore's recommendations, in that it was again based on making the river navigable. As the millers were given powers which would have effectively shut the navigation for two months each year, and the tolls were set at a level which would have discouraged traffic, no further action was taken.|$|E
5000|$|Hawkesbury was a {{rural parish}} in Gloucestershire in which {{agriculture}} and animal husbandry were economically dominant.

[...] Cattle and sheep {{were important to}} the livelihood {{of the residents of}} Hawkesbury as there was a fair held on last Friday in August for the sale of those animals. The raising of sheep was a principal source of income, primarily for their wool. Homes constructed along streams aided in the wool production industry as it provided water necessary for dying and washing. This water also provided means to grind corn in grist mills and <b>finish</b> <b>cloth</b> in fulling mills.|$|R

2500|$|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell from Newburyport, Massachusetts {{memorised}} {{the design}} of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810.

Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at Waltham, Massachusetts, second to the Beverly Cotton Manufactory. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering, one of the first uses of it in the United States. Lowell, Massachusetts, using [...] of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the Merrimack River, is considered by some as a major contributor {{to the success of the}} American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like Waltham-Lowell system was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the Irish Potato Famine, the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Throughout antiquity, much of the population was employed in cloth-related industries from fiber production to laundering finished clothing. Fulling, (in a Roman context this includes both <b>finishing</b> <b>cloth</b> from the loom and laundering soiled clothing) and dying are particularly interesting as they are the most archaeologically visible textile trades. The technical bases and economic impact of these related trades are well studied and several debates {{in the last five years}} have raised interest in the social position of Roman cloth finishers. Interpersonal relationships between individuals in these trades are rarely studied, however, due to a perceived lack of evidence. This thesis attempts to contribute to those debates by surveying the available literary, epigraphic, and art historical evidence for the personal relationships of Roman cloth finishers and then developing a methodology to investigate opportunities for communication and social contact available to Roman cloth finishers through an analysis of the archaeological remains of <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> workshops. The methodology developed in this work uses the biological limitations of the human field of view to determine what may have been visible from particularworkstations, in concert with historical and sociological studies of communication to establish the importance of non-verbal communication to work relationships in the Roman period. Visibility analysis is then applied to a selection of the well-preserved <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> workshops from the imperial Roman cities of Pompeii and Ostia, which are evaluated comparatively to highlight the ways that the physical arrangement of the workspace can influence communication among the workers...|$|R
50|$|The {{main steps}} in the {{production}} of cloth are producing the fibre, preparing it, converting it to yarn, converting yarn to <b>cloth,</b> and then <b>finishing</b> the <b>cloth.</b> The cloth is then taken to the manufacturer of garments. The preparation of the fibres differs the most, depending on the fibre used. Flax requires retting and dressing, while wool requires carding and washing. The spinning and weaving processes are very similar between fibres, however.|$|R
