5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts, {{humanitarian}} agencies {{declared an}} end to the food emergency and factional fighting decreased. When Task Force Ranger and the SAR team were pinned down during a raid in what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, the 10th Mountain Division provided infantry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> quick reaction force sent to rescue them. The 10th Mountain Division had two soldiers killed in the fighting, which was the longest sustained firefight by regular US Army forces since the Vietnam War. The division began a gradual reduction of forces in Somalia in February 1994, until the last soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry returned to the United States in March 1994.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{contend that}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> and North Korea, {{locked in a}} bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Masan was an {{engagement}} between United Nations (UN) and North Korean (NK) forces, {{which took place}} early in the Korean War between August 5 and September 19, 1950, {{in the vicinity of}} Masan and the Naktong River in South Korea. It was part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> after large numbers of United States (US) and Republic of Korea (ROK) troops were able to repel the repeated attacks of two North Korean divisions.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous problem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces. The town {{had a large}} community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E

5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> at the bargaining table. After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces.

Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October 1952, IX Corps {{launched}} an offensive, Operation Showdown, intended {{to improve its}} defensive lines by capturing a complex of hills and force Chinese lines back. This complex included Pike's Peak, Jane Russell Hill, Sandy Hill, and Triangle Hill, northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division advanced, encountering resistance from the 15th Chinese Field Army. In the ensuing Battle of Triangle Hill, the four hills were captured and recaptured by both sides {{several times in the}} heaviest fighting that year. Eventually, the UN forces withdrew having been unsuccessful in capturing their objectives. UN forces suffered 9,000 killed and the Chinese suffered 19,000 killed or wounded during the fighting. The result of the battle had only been a slight improvement in IX Corps' positions, as Chinese positions had been too well fortified <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces to take and hold the ground. For the remainder of the year, US and Chinese forces both conducted a series of smaller raids on each other's lines, avoiding major conflicts, as armistice negotiations continued unsuccessfully. In November, the Chinese {{launched an}}other offensive to retake ground lost during these operations, which was again repulsed by UN forces.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, {{just across}} the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a {{cease-fire}} between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation.

5|$|The Chinese {{victory at}} Unsan {{was as much}} of a {{surprise}} to the Chinese leadership as it was to the UN forces. The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea, while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale. PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign, while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea, resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch'ongch'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations {{forces were}} {{organized}} {{under the command}} of the United States Army. The Eighth United States Army served as the headquarters component <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> forces, and was headquartered at Taegu.

These forces occupied the western segment of the perimeter, along the Naktong River. The Republic of Korea Army, a force of 58,000, was organized into two corps and five divisions; from east to west, ROK I Corps controlled the 8th Infantry Division and Capital Divisions, while the ROK II Corps controlled the 1st Division and 6th Infantry Division. A reconstituted ROK 3rd Division was placed under direct ROK Army control. Morale among the UN units was low due to the large number of defeats incurred to that point in the war. US forces had suffered over 6,000 casualties over the past month, while the South Korean Army had lost an estimated 70,000.|$|E
5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated DetachmentS, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, DetachmentS was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, DetachmentS had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN.</b> Aircraft of DetachmentS evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia.
