NY56 proceeds northeastward through the hamlet of Sevey along a two-lane highway through dense woods of the Adirondack Park, paralleling the Raquette River past Chander Pond. The Raquette soon diverges into the Carry Falls Reservoir, while NY56 continues northwestward, passing a western jaunt of the reservoir. Turning west from the Raquette, the route enters the town of Parishville and the hamlet of Stark. Stark consists of one building and more dense woods. After re-entering the town of Colton, NY56 bends northward and soon northwestward out of the Adirondack Park. After leaving the park, NY56 enters the hamlets of Irish Settlement and South Colton. In South Colton, NY56 passes a long stretch of residences before turning westward at a crossing of the Raquette River. NY56 leaves South Colton, passes north of Higley <b>Flow</b> <b>State</b> Park, and enters the hamlet of Colton. In Colton, NY56 intersects with CR58 (Colton-Parishville Road). After crossing the Raquette for the second time, NY56 intersects with the eastern terminus of NY68 (Colton-Pierrepont Road).|$|E
2500|$|The precise figure Germany paid is {{a matter}} of dispute. The German Government {{estimated}} it had paid the equivalent of 67.8 billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure includedother than gold or goods in kindthe scuttling of the interned German fleet at Scapa <b>Flow,</b> <b>state</b> property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that [...] gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which [...] was paid before the implementation of the London Schedule of Payments. Niall Ferguson provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than [...] gold marks. Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his definitive econometric study (1988, pp.106–19), concedes that Germany transferred 16.8 billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. [...] The net capital transfer into Germany amounted to 17.75 billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919–1931. In effect, therefore, America paid reparations to Germany—four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan. According to Gerhard Weinberg, reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors.|$|E

This study aimed to enrich understanding about bodily sensations and <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> in sport by exploring this experience in national hunt jockeys. The interspecies nature of horse-rider partnerships accentuates the importance of bodily awareness in equestrian sports. Therefore, horse racing provided a fertile context in which to investigate bodily sensations experienced during <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> in sport. In-depth, semi-structured interviews exploring the experience of flow in horse racing were undertaken with 10 professional national hunt jockeys (M age = 28. 1 years). Data were interpreted iteratively using inductive categorising/thematic and connecting analyses. Present findings suggested that <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> in jockeys produce an idiosyncratic and multifaceted sensory experience, and indicated that altered physical perceptions during flow were not restricted to kinaesthetic properties. Jockeys explained that distinct bodily sensations were experienced during <b>flow</b> <b>states,</b> and described alterations in their perceptions of kinaesthetic ‘feel’, balance, arousal and strength of touch. Each of these bodily sensations was discussed in relation to sensory information received from the horse, and a connecting analysis enlightened the factors underlying the realisation of these unique bodily sensations that accompanied <b>flow</b> <b>states.</b> Findings are discussed with respect to the existing literature on flow in sport and recommendations for future research are outlined.

40|$|The {{differences}} between classical and quantum mechanics were highlighted {{early in the}} development of quantum mechanics when Schrodinger proposed the thought experiment of a cat in a superposition of alive and dead. In this thesis I try to understand these differences by considering superpositions of large objects at a single particle level. Research in the field of superconductors has provided evidence for macroscopic quantum superpositions (or cat states) of currents in superconducting loops. Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms provide another promising system for experimentally producing similar results. I begin by describing two straightforward schemes that make macroscopic superpositions of superfluid <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in optical lattice rings. The first scheme achieves a superposition of three <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> by nonadiabatically evolving the barrier heights between the sites. The second scheme produces a superposition of two <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> by applying a 7 f phase around the ring. This could be experimentally achieved by physically rotating the sites or imparting angular momentum from two co-propagating lasers. The next part of the thesis investigates why it is difficult to produce macroscopic superpositions. By treating the interaction strength between the atoms as a perturbation I show three reasons, other than decoherence, why macroscopic superpositions are hard to make. Firstly, the energy of the two distinct <b>flow</b> <b>states</b> must be sufficiently close. Secondly, coupling between the two states must be sufficiently strong, and thirdly, other states must be well separated from those two <b>flow</b> <b>states.</b> To make larger superpositions I look at a Josephson junction coupled to a superfluid loop. This shows that making superpositions depends on the number of atoms in the junction rather than the whole system. Finally I propose ways of developing the work. This concentrates on how the systems could experimentally create macroscopic superpositions and how we could measure signatures of these states. I then suggest ways of using the systems, such as quantum information and precision measurement schemes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
