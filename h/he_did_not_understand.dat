5|$|After leaving Hull, Harries {{moved to}} London {{to work for}} the Southern News Service news agency, writing diary pieces for the Daily Mail and News of the World from 1975 to 1976. On the advice of a friend, he applied for a {{position}} as a researcher for Granada Television in Manchester. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the appeal of television production, and as a result he was turned away at two interviews before being hired in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response from video game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; only later was their importance explored {{at the end of}} Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may}} not have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E

5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E

He planned to dredge and drain the Everglades for development, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> {{the value of this}} unique area. Diston connected Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the Kissimmee River.|$|E

In his autobiography, Phan admitted <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the meaning of the text in great detail at the time, but by age six, he was skillful enough to write a variant of the Analects that parodied his classmates, which earned him a caning from his father.|$|E

The security officer, then head of the security at the centre gave evidence at a Corruption and Crime Commission hearing in June 2006 that he had taped over the footage showing the assault, because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> why the Constable hit the alleged offender and did not want the officer to lose his job.|$|E

Gerow's father, William Sr., stated <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> any possible motive for the death of his daughter. Kalhauser is considered a person of interest in the murder since the photograph was discovered and police have also asked for information regarding him as well as the victim during the two decades of her life. After the family received the remains of the victim, the body was cremated.|$|E
25|$|Following {{delivery}} of the judgment, counsel for the parties agreed that the trial would proceed, without prejudice {{to the question of}} jurisdiction, which Judge Willis would consider further. The court then adjourned for the day. On returning the following morning (17 September), there was debate about the way in which depositions from the witnesses had been taken in Geelong, specifically, whether they were taken in Bonjon's presence, and whether Bonjon had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. Evidence was also given that Bonjon had not had the proceedings translated for him adequately, and that as such <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the nature of the case against him. Under these circumstances, the Crown Prosecutor Croke decided not to proceed with the case, and Bonjon was remanded until the following month's session. The following month, Bonjon was discharged.|$|E
