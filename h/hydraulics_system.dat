25|$|The ancient Khmers were a {{traditional}} agricultural community, relying heavily on rice farming. The farmers, who formed {{the majority of}} kingdom's population, planted rice near {{the banks of the}} lake or river, in the irrigated plains surrounding their villages, or in the hills when lowlands were flooded. The rice paddies were irrigated by a massive and complex <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system,</b> including networks of canals and barays, or giant water reservoirs. This system enabled the formation of large-scale rice farming communities surrounding Khmer cities. Sugar palm trees, fruit trees, and vegetables were grown in the orchards by the villages, providing other sources of agricultural produce such as palm sugar, palm wine, coconut, various tropical fruits, and vegetables.|$|E
2500|$|After an investigation, it was {{determined}} that a design flaw with the engine air particle separator (EAPS) caused it to jam in flight, causing a shock wave in the <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system</b> and subsequent leaks. [...] Hydraulic fluid leaked into the IR suppressors and was the cause of the nacelle fires. As a result, all Block-A V-22 aircraft were placed under flight restrictions until modification kits could be installed. [...] No fielded Marine MV-22s were affected, as those Block-B aircraft already incorporated the modification.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydraulics</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become}} {{unavoidable}} in most cutting edge industries. They indeed permit {{to reach a}} consistently high level of precision, to achieve important energy savings and can withstand tremendous loads as for mechanics systems. However, among “hydraulic” flaws, {{one of them is}} the main manufacturer’s concern and a source of discomfort for anyone having to sustain it, the hydraulic noise. Some soft wares already provide a simulation tool for <b>hydraulics</b> <b>systems</b> and thus for hydraulic noise but none of them are taking into account the interaction between the fluid and its support structure. For this reason we propose to create a toolbox using SimscapeTM, a simulation interface for MATLAB®, which will contain any component that a hydraulic system can incorporate aiming to have a simple and efficient tool for the simulation of these <b>hydraulics</b> <b>systems,</b> and particularly that of a plane, and to study the noise created taking into account the structure-borne noise which plays a fundamental part in the noise generation. The aim is therefore to provide a toolbox as operating and complete as possible for this expressed need...|$|R

The basement of the Stuyvesant contained a working machine shop, where Belasco and his team experimented with lighting and other special effects. Many of the innovations developed in the Belasco shop were sold to other producers.|$|R

We demonstrate an automated incremental approach to CSA, in which models are extended incrementally and previous results incorporated {{in such a way as}} to significantly reduce the time and effort required for the new analysis. The approach is demonstrated on a case study concerning the <b>hydraulics</b> <b>systems</b> for the Airbus A 320 aircraft...|$|R

50|$|Azura floats on {{the surface}} of the sea and weighs 45 tons (41 tonnes). It has a unique {{floating}} mechanism that can rotate 360 degress. This enables it to extract power from horizontal (surge) as well as vertical (heave) wave motion. It has reserve buoyancy that is very low, allowing it to partially submerge beneath large waves.Azura is a point absorber. This means that it uses a floating surface mechanism to absorb the energy of waves from different directions. This is the most common type of deepwater wave energy generator. The generator is driven with a high-pressure <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{primary cause}} of the {{incident}} was improper maintenance, caused by an incorrect part installed in the <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in the fuel leak. However, the final investigation also assigned the flight crew partial responsibility for failing to detect the fuel situation earlier. Review of the Cockpit Voice Recorder showed that the pilot failed to use the main procedural checklist when attempting to rectify the imbalance of fuel between the tanks, which might have prevented {{the extent of the}} fuel leak on one side. The pilot also transferred fuel from the working engine to the failing engine which magnified the crisis.|$|E

50|$|A Straits Times article dated 14 August {{also raised}} the issue of the high costs of {{producing}} Rag floats, with reports of figures between $6,000-$30,000 spent on individual floats, the higher figure once going towards the installation of a <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system.</b> NUSSU representatives admitted that while caps on spending are put into place, over-spending on floats is largely ungovernable. With reports of intense, often aggressive rivalries, and wastage of resources (how, for example, students reportedly emptied soft drink cans instead of collecting used ones), the article questioned if Rag had become derailed, regressing from its function as a Freshman event to an unhealthy competition.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to insufficient ram pressure, a New York Times investigationof the Deepwater Horizon oil spill listed other problem areas for deepwater blowout preventers.

Requiring two shear rams in every blowout preventer may help to avoid this problem and to avoid some types of [...] "single-point failure". Other technologies that might improve the reliability of BOPs include backup systems for sending commands to the BOP and more powerful submersibles that connect to the BOP's <b>hydraulics</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
