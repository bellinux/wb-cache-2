The powers of the Commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the Corporation or the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral {{legislature}} with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and {{are elected}} {{on a first}} past the post system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally five years from 2011–16). The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the Monarch to serve as First Minister. Other ministers are appointed by the First Minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the <b>executive</b> <b>arm</b> of the devolved government. The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister, who is accountable to the Scottish Parliament and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The First Minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the Deputy First Minister, currently John Swinney MSP, who deputises for the First Minister {{during a period of}} absence of overseas visits. Alongside the Deputy First Minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility. Swinney is also currently Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills. The Scottish Government's cabinet comprises nine cabinet secretaries, who form the Cabinet of Scotland. There are also twelve other ministers, who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas. As a result, junior ministers do not attend cabinet meetings.|$|E

40|$|This article studied, from 1999 to 2003, {{the profile}} of {{advertisement}} placement by the <b>executive</b> and legislative <b>arms</b> {{of the government of}} Lagos State of Nigeria, in three newspapers and one magazine namely The Punch, Vanguard, Eko Today and Tell, respectively. The objective was to determine if the magnitude of media reports was dependent on the extent of advert placements. Content Analysis and Survey were adopted to obtain the requisite facts. The study established that the press published more stories on the executive than legislature. This disparity was also demonstrated in the number of the advertisements published by the press on the two arms of government. The study found that there was a positive correlation between the stories and the adverts published for the legislative and <b>executive</b> <b>arms</b> of the government (r = 0. 726, n = 4, p = 0. 137, one tailed). This led to the acceptance of the hypothesis that the disparity in advertisement placement correlates positively with press performance differential on the legislative and the <b>executive</b> <b>arms</b> of government. However, this positive correlation was insignificant. However, {{it was not possible to}} conclude that the disparity in the placement of adverts by the legislators and executives actually caused the press coverage differential because the cause could as well have been as a result of other factors which include the fact that the volume of official tasks performed by the executive was far more than that of the legislature...|$|R

25|$|The fiscal was {{in charge}} of {{presenting}} the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The calificadores were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the notario de secuestros (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the notario del secreto (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the escribano general (General Notary), secretary of the court.

40|$|Institutional {{responses}} {{to changes in}} the higher education environment have caused movements in the roles and identities of administrative managers in UK universities. These shifts have highlighted the problem for individuals of balancing traditional public service considerations of administration with institutional innovation and development. Administrative managers find themselves not only acting as independent arbiters, giving impartial advice on the basis of professional expertise, but also becoming involved in political judgements about institutional futures. They increasingly undertake an interpretive function between the various communities of the university and its external partners. As the boundaries of the university have become more permeable, administrative and academic management have inter-digitated, and hybrid roles have developed. In undertaking increasingly complex functions, therefore, administrative managers {{play a critical role in}} linking the academic and <b>executive</b> <b>arms</b> of governance in the university...|$|R

The final step was convincing Ed Boon, co-creator of the franchise and executive producer at NetherRealm Studios, who had just produced the latest video game installment, to agree to the series. Boon was impressed with Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, but not entirely sold on Tancharoen's re-imagined vision. After he met with Tancharoen, Boon was surprised by his enthusiasm for the franchise and quickly offered his support.|$|R

25|$|In 1991, Law 7.663 {{was enacted}} {{calling for the}} {{creation}} of the Alto-Tietê Basin Committee. However this committee was only formally established in November 1994, a result of a deliberate effort by the state técnicos (technical staff) to mobilize the municipal government and, especially, civil society. Its functions include setting guidelines and approving river basin plans; proposing pricing criteria and values for bulk water pricing and a program for allocating proceeds derived from such water charges; integrating the decision-making and programs of water-related institutions working in the basin; and other responsibilities. The 48 seats of the committee's assembly are divided equally among representatives of three sectors: municipal government, state government agencies (including public water users), and organized civil society groups (including those representing private water users). Local issues are decided in the five sub-committees created after 1997.

By ruthlessly perpetuating the illusion that wind farms can somehow save the planet, they keep the money flowing.
