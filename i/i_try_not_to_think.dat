At first all my faculties were absorbed and as if neutralised by the sheer novelty of the situation. The first to emerge was the sense of security so much more perfect than in any small boat I've ever been in; the, as it were, material, stillness, and immobility (though it was a bumpy day). I very soon ceased to hear the roar of the wind and engines--unless, indeed, some cylinders missed, when I became acutely aware of that. Within the rigid spread of the powerful planes, so strangely motionless I had sometimes the illusion of sitting as if by enchantment in a block of suspended marble. Even while looking over at the aeroplane's shadow running prettily over land and sea, I had the impression of extreme slowness. I imagine that had she suddenly nose- dived out of control, I would have gone to the final smash without a single additional heartbeat. I am sure I would not have known. It is doubtless otherwise with the man in control.|$|E

[...] At the {{conclusion}} of his college career, Wolfert told an interviewer that his records were a tribute to his team:"I think it's a testament to our offense. We're really powerful and always in the red zone, so when they've been short of touchdowns, I've been able to knock down three points. A lot of touchdowns, too, and extra points with them."He was selected by Sports Illustrated in 2007 as an Honorable Mention player.

5000|$|He {{wrote of}} his capture {{in a letter}} written from a Westphalian prison camp:This is the first chance I have had to write you a long letter I have heard nothing from the outside yet, but am hopeful. Hope is all that keeps us going. I {{will tell you how}} I {{happened}} to be the first in the Escadrille to be taken alive — a dubious distinction. We were protecting a group of bombing planes on a daylight raid some distance in enemy territory. Suddenly we were attacked by a rather energetic patrol of monoplaces, and a general mix up ensued. One of our planes in front of me was attacked and I was able to 'crock' the German — short lived satisfaction. The monoplace was protected by two others which in turn attacked me from behind riddling my machine To continue in a straight line was fatal So I did a renversement and attacked — my only defense.Immediately, of course, I was separated from our group, which continued. It would not have been so bad had my motor not been touched at the first volley. It worked only intermittently causing loss of height. We had a wild fight almost to the ground. I did all sorts of stunts to avoid fire on the line of flight. The enemy flew well. We missed collision twice by inches. I was badly raked by cross fire; music of bullets striking motor and cables. Toward the end my wind-shield was shattered and my goggles broken by a ball which slightly stunned me. I had an awful feeling of despair at the thought of the inevitable landing in Germany. As I neared the ground I had an instant's desire to dive into it — saw a wood in front of me, jumped it and landed instinctively on the crest of a hill. One of the Germans flew over me waved his hand turned and landed followed by his two comrades.All saluted very politely as they came up — young chaps perfectly correct. My machine was a wreck thirty bullets in the fuselage motor and radiator exactly half of the cables cut tires punctured and wings riddled. It was a beautiful machine and had always served me well. Too bad!The aviators took me to lunch at their quarters where I awaited a motor which took me to a prison in a fortress. One always expects to be either killed or wounded — never taken. So I had left the ground in two sweaters no coat and with no money. Confess I cried like a baby when I was finally alone in my cell. The first three days were terrible. One is not glad to be alive, especially when one wakes, forgets for a moment where one is, and then remembers. Pleasantest are the nights, for one always has vivid dreams of home or the Front You can understand how wearing it is, to be helpless — a sort of living corpse — when there is need of every one. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it.Willis was interned in the prison camps of Montmedy, Carlsruhe, Landshut, Giitersloh, reprisal camp Eutin, Bad Stuer, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Magdeburg, Wurzburg, and Villingen, during 14 months of captivity. [...] After several attempts, Willis disguised as a German guard, made his escape from the American camp at Villingen on Oct. 4, 1918, crossing the Rhine river into Switzerland and finally back to Paris.|$|E
40|$|Feldenkrais {{suggested}} that “the object of {{education should be}} to eliminate these compulsive states and to help the person to acquire the ability for potent action; {{that is to be}} able to control the body excitations and act as if in the case of spontaneous action” (Feldenkrais, The Potent Self: A Study of Spontaneity and Compulsion, 2003). The training of the actor/singer at London College of Music embraces this ideal as a core principle with a course premised on developing the reflective (or ‘self-thinking’) performer, intelligent as well as skilled. Movement is core within the structure of training as it is through movement (or action) that we are able to understand our own movement history from which we can then begin to realise and capture the skills and techniques of play and spontaneity to create character along with the obvious benefits that a body free of superfluidity and aware of movement can support through posture and alignment techniques within the spoken and sung word. Feldenkrais aligns itself within the training through the support of recognising the superfluous and informing choice, through challenging compulsive states within each individual, “When I am presented with a trouble in function, I make a special effort not to think in words. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> logically and in correctly formed sentences…. I have found this way of imagining so fruitful that I cannot do without it. It often shows me where my knowledge is insufficient so that I know exactly what I am after…I form a working theory and change it in the light of new observations I must add to make the theory work” (Feldenkrais, Body Awareness as Healing Therapy: The Case of Nora, 1993). The structure of the ATM supports ever growing class sizes and the supports the individual movement potential within every performer which is developed through four years of training and with the implementation of FI engages in making every student curious about their learning environment and the potential to be discovered resulting in a body in control and yet spontaneous in action...|$|E
