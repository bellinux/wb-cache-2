5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet {{it has been argued}} by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E

25|$|<b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} {{considered}} Roman, Odoacer's ethnic origins are not completely known. Both the Anonymus Valesianus and John of Antioch state his father's name was Edeko.

Since Sebastian Tillemont in the 17th century, all three have been considered to be the same person. In his Getica, Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the Turcilingi (Turc-ilingi or Torcilingorum rex). However, in his Romana, the same author defines him {{as a member of the}} Rugii (Odoacer genere Rogus). The Consularia Italica calls him king of the Heruli, while Theophanes appears to be guessing when he calls him a Goth.|$|E
25|$|McCarver's 14th Arkansas Regiment {{has been}} {{described}} as the regiment that barely was, since it existed only briefly as a full regiment. The first eight companies were mustered into service between August 31 and September 23, and the Field and Staff Officers were appointed on September 23, 1861, at Pocahontas, Arkansas. October 22, 1861, is recognized as the date of the organization of the regiment because that's when the ninth company joined the unit, and the company muster rolls were submitted to the Confederate War Department along with official notification of the organization of the regiment, (initially designated by Colonel Solon Borland as the 9th Arkansas). Stationed in the same area were the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Arkansas Regiments, which led Col. Solon Borland, commanding Post of Pocahontas, to muster Col. James H. McCarver's new regiment into service as the 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. This would have been logical, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment had already been authorized by the State Military Board and mustered into service at Pine Bluff on July 25, 1861, Colonel John M. Bradley commanding. When Colonel Borland sent the muster-in rolls to the Confederate War Department, he was informed that McCarver's regiment would instead be designated as the 14th Arkansas Regiment.|$|E

Retrospective administrative claims were analyzed. Intercepts changes of cost per visit in facilities started the reform in different stages and of overall Qianjiang were compared. Referral rate, prescribing indicators, hospitalization rate, income of facility and individuals were compared pre- and post- the reform. Growth rate of cost per visit in health centers was contained in 2008, kept unchanged in 2009. Cost containment effect on village clinics was observed in each starting stage of reforms, but vanished later on. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> proportion of essential medicines used in health centers significantly increased (X 2 test, P< 0. 05), prescription indicators were not improved significantly in all facilities.

Cost containment objective of the capitation reform was achieved immediately following the reform, but was not sustainable.
