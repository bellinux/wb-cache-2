5|$|Despite serving {{for over}} thirty years, the ships had uneventful careers. They spent {{their first two}} decades in service with the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where they were {{primarily}} occupied with training maneuvers. Lepanto was converted into a training ship in 1902 and Italia was significantly modernized in 190508 before also becoming a training ship. They briefly saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops defending Tripoli. Lepanto was discarded in early 1915, though Italia continued on as a guard ship during World War <b>I,</b> <b>eventually</b> being converted into a grain transport. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason behind}} these discords were {{laid on the}} {{imperfect}} execution of the reorganisation of the College in 1568 and the uncertainty over issue of granting arms to the new and emerging gentry of the era. An enquiry into {{the state of the}} College lasted for one year, finally reporting to William Cecil, Baron Burghley in 1596; as a consequence, many important measures of reform for the College were made in the reign of James <b>I.</b> <b>Eventually,</b> these animosities among the heralds in the College ended only after the expulsion of one and the death of another.|$|E

He was educated at Moulton Grammar School and Felsted School and joined his father's wood-importing firm, which {{supported}} his amateur status in cricket and boxing. Douglas also played football once for the England amateur side (occasion unknown, through loss of records). He served in the Bedfordshire Regiment throughout World War <b>I,</b> <b>eventually</b> as major (acting lieutenant-colonel).|$|E
25|$|Now a teenager, Alexandra {{began to}} attract the gaze of men. In 1936, the fifteen-years-old Princess {{received}} her first marriage proposal: King Zog I of Albania, who wished to marry {{a member of the}} European royalty in order to consolidate his position, asked her hand. However, the Greek diplomacy, which maintained complex relations with the Kingdom of Albania because of the possession of Northern Epirus, rejected this proposal and King Zog <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> married the Hungarian Countess Géraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Moscow was {{stable and}} prosperous {{for many years}} and {{attracted}} a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.|$|E

But, <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E
25|$|Ishme-Dagan I (c. 1721 BC – c. 1681 BC), son and {{successor}} of Shamshi-Adad I, {{held the}} capital city of his realm of influence in Ekallatum and ruled over the southeastern region of Upper Mesopotamia, including the city-state Assur. Ishme-Dagan I’s main challenge was in keeping his enemies in check; to his east were the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, inhabited by warlike pastoral peoples, and to the south was the Mesopotamian kingdom of Eshnunna. Although his father counted Ishme-Dagan I as politically astute and a capable soldier, commending him as he berated Yasmah-Adad in their letters, Ishme-Dagan I was not able to hold his father’s empire for long after his father died. Ishme-Dagan <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> lost most of his domain, and was reduced to holding Assur and Ekallatum, despite waging several counter offensives to try to regain the upper Khabur area.|$|E
25|$|Selim <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> {{defeated}} Ismail at {{the battle}} of Chaldiran in 1514. Ismail's army was more mobile and his soldiers were better prepared, but the Ottomans prevailed {{due in large part to}} their efficient modern army, and possession of artillery, black powder and muskets. Ismail was wounded and almost captured in battle. Selim entered the Iranian capital of Tabriz in triumph on September 5, but did not linger. A mutiny among his troops, fearing a counterattack and entrapment by fresh Safavid forces called in from the interior, forced the triumphant Ottomans to withdraw prematurely. This allowed Ismail to recover. Among the booty from Tabriz was Ismail's favorite wife, for whose release the Sultan demanded huge concessions, which were refused. Despite his defeat at the Battle of Chaldiran, Ismail quickly recovered most of his kingdom, from east of the Lake Van to the Persian Gulf. However, the Ottomans managed to annex for the first time Eastern Anatolia and parts of Mesopotamia, as well as briefly northwestern Iran.|$|E

25|$|The Morayshire Railway was {{the first}} railway to be built north of Aberdeen, in Scotland. It {{received}} royal assent in 1846 but construction did not start until 1851 due to the economic conditions existing in the United Kingdom at the time. The railway was built in two phases with the section from Elgin to Lossiemouth completed in 1852. When the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I) reached Keith via Elgin, the Morayshire was able to complete the Speyside second phase by connecting the Craigellachie line at Orton. Initially, the Morayshire ran its own locomotives on the I track between Elgin and Orton but this lasted {{only a short time}} and the Morayshire carriages were then hauled to Orton by the I Disagreements with the <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> forced the Morayshire into building a new section of track between their Elgin station and Rothes and was completed in 1862. The Morayshire completed its final act of enlargement by connecting to the new Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) station in 1863. Crippling debt forced the company into agreeing with the GNoSR for it to take over the running of the track in 1866. When the Morayshire finally managed to greatly reduce its debt, a long sought after amalgamation with the GNoSR finally took place in 1881.|$|E

Jack Nicholson turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained when filming Jaws, [...] "Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155 days' worth of Close Encounters. He even contributed ideas." [...] Dreyfuss reflected, [...] "I launched myself into a campaign to get the part.

500|$|During {{the filming}} of Jackson's 1996 film The Frighteners, Universal Pictures was {{impressed}} with Jackson's dailies and early visual effects footage. The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film Creature from the Black Lagoon. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson's obsession with King Kong and subsequently offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry of lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the King Kong offer, but he [...] "quickly became disturbed by the fact that someone else would take it over," [...] Jackson continued, [...] "and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> said yes to Universal." ...|$|E

[...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E

He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} made up of two {{different}} classes of songs: lengthy improvisations from the band's live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written. Barrett's LSD intake escalated part-way through the album's recording sessions. Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively trouble-free, Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. In an attempt to build a relationship with the band, Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in. These jam sessions worked well with Waters, who was apparently helpful, and Wright, who was [...] "laid-back". Smith's attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive: [...] "With Syd, <b>I</b> <b>eventually</b> realised I was wasting my time." [...] Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come. Nevertheless, he managed to [...] "discourage the live ramble", as band manager Peter Jenner called it, guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length.|$|E
