SRI describes its mission as creating world-changing solutions to make people safer, <b>healthier,</b> <b>and</b> more productive. It performs client-sponsored research and development for government agencies, commercial businesses, and private foundations. It also licenses its technologies, forms strategic partnerships, sells products, and creates spin-off companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a <b>healthier</b> <b>and</b> more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

25|$|Cardboard, {{aluminium}} foil, {{and plastic}} bags {{for well over}} 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in Chad by the combined efforts of the Jewish World Watch, the Dutch foundation KoZon, and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased Arabic gum, and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are <b>healthier</b> <b>and</b> they have more time to grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.|$|E
25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally <b>healthier,</b> <b>and</b> also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to have a heart attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E
40|$|The {{wireless}} motility capsule (WMC) measures intraluminal pH and pressure, {{and records}} transit time and contractile activity throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Our {{hypothesis is that}} WMC can differentiate antroduodenal pressure profiles between <b>healthy</b> people <b>and</b> patients with upper gut motility dysfunctions. This study aims to analyze differences in the phasic pressure profiles of the stomach and small intestine in <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> gastroparetic subjects. Data from 71 <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> 42 gastroparetic subjects were analyzed. The number of contractions (Ct), area under the pressure curve and motility index (MI[*]=[*]Ln (Ct *sum amplitudes + 1)) were analyzed for 60 [*]min before gastric emptying of the capsule (GET), (gastric window) and after GET (small bowel window) and results between groups were compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Significant differences were observed between <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> gastroparetic subjects for Ct and MI (P [*]<[*] 0. 05). Median values of the motility parameters in gastric window were Ct[*]=[*] 72, MI[*]=[*] 11. 83 for <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> Ct[*]=[*] 47, MI[*]=[*] 11. 12 for gastroparetics. In the small bowel, median values were Ct[*]=[*] 144. 5, MI[*]=[*] 12. 78 for <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> Ct[*]=[*] 93, MI[*]=[*] 12. 12 for gastroparetics. Diabetic subjects with gastroparesis showed significantly lower Ct and MI compared with healthy subjects in both gastric and small bowel windows while idiopathic gastroparetic subjects did not show significant differences. The WMC is able to differentiate between <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> gastroparetic subjects based on gastric and small bowel motility profiles...|$|R

25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be <b>healthier</b> <b>and</b> better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E
