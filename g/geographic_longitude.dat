Most {{of our knowledge}} of it comes from Strabo, according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized Eratosthenes mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities. Hipparchus insists that a geographic map must be based only on astronomical measurements of latitudes and longitudes and triangulation for finding unknown distances. In geographic theory and methods Hipparchus introduced three main innovations.He {{was the first to}} use the grade grid, to determine geographic latitude from star observations, and not only from the sun’s altitude, a method known long before him, and to suggest that <b>geographic</b> <b>longitude</b> could be determined by means of simultaneous observations of lunar eclipses in distant places. In the practical part of his work, the so-called [...] "table of climata", Hipparchus listed latitudes for several tens of localities. In particular, he improved Eratosthenes' values for the latitudes of Athens, Sicily, and southern extremity of India. In calculating latitudes of climata (latitudes correlated with the length of the longest solstitial day), Hipparchus used an unexpectedly accurate value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, 23°40′ (the actual value {{in the second half of}} the 2nd century [...] was approximately 23°43′), whereas all other ancient authors knew only a roughly rounded value 24°, and even Ptolemy used a less accurate value, 23°51′. Hipparchus opposed the view generally accepted in the Hellenistic period that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the Caspian Sea are parts of a single ocean. At the same time he extends the limits of the oikoumene, i.e. the inhabited part of the land, up to the equator and the Arctic Circle. Hipparchus’ ideas found their reflection in the Geography of Ptolemy. In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus’ vision of what geography ought to be.|$|E

All simulations are run for the 2002 March equinox. The input parameters are: hemispheric power =  39  GW, cross-polar cap potential =  60  kV, and F 10.7  =  200 sfu. The model is run for 48  h to reach a quasi-steady state and then continued from the start-up simulation for another 24  h; these data are used for analysis.

40|$|Using the spherical {{harmonic}} coefficients {{defining the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field Models for the 21 epochs 1900 to 2000, the geographic {{locations of the}} dip equator in different longitudes were computed. It is shown that the migratory trends in the dip equator are widely different in the American, African and Indian sectors. The largest change is seen over 30 °W to 40 °W while there is practically no secular movement over 100 years in the 30 °E longitude. It is seen that the <b>geographic</b> <b>longitude</b> of the dip equator farthest away from the geographic equator in the American sector shows a westward migration {{at the rate of}} ~ 0. 2 °/year which compares favorably with the average westward drift of the non-dipolar field discussed in the literature. The distance between the magnetic center of the eccentric dipole and the Earth’s center, the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly (SAGA) center and the migration of the local minimum of the dip equatorial longitude in the American center are all linearly related. In addition, the westward drift in the agonic line over the geographic equator in the American sector, indicative of the contributions from non-dipolar terms, is also linearly related to the three parameters. As the observed location of the dip equator in the American sector closely matches the model-based one, it is suggested that identification of the <b>geographic</b> <b>longitude</b> of the dip equator in the American zone based on a survey over a small area can provide useful information on several other parameters of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field...|$|E
