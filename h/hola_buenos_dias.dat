50|$|On September 15, 2007, KVEA {{became the}} second Spanish-language {{television}} {{station in the}} United States (after Reno-based CW affiliate KAZR-CA) and the sixth television station in the Los Angeles market to broadcast its local newscasts (<b>Buenos</b> <b>Días</b> Los Angeles) in high definition. In 2009, <b>Buenos</b> <b>Días</b> was cancelled due to difficulties with NBC. Its anchors became reporters, and were joined by former KWHY anchor Dunia Elvir (who had presented morning updates during ¡Levántate!, now known as Un Nuevo Día).

Ratings improved, and <b>Buenos</b> <b>Días</b> competed with KMEX's morning newscast Primera Edicion. Iniguez was later moved to an anchor position on <b>Buenos</b> <b>Días.</b>|$|R
