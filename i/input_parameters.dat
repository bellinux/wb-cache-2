5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane {{that will result in}} flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E

30|$|This {{provenance}} service concerns uncovering hidden correlation {{that frequently}} occurs for every parameter participating in simulations. As an example, the service can find any association rule such {{that when the}} value of a certain field was ‘A’, it was more likely for another field to be ‘B’, or more generally, when {{the value of a}}n <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> was ‘A’, it was more likely for another <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> to be ‘B’. Through the service, a user can find out a hidden execution pattern of simulations in which given that a value was ‘X’ for an <b>input</b> <b>parameter,</b> the value of another <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> was ‘Y’ in most cases. The most relevant technique for realizing this service is frequent pattern mining mentioned earlier.|$|R

25|$|SQL Server {{also allows}} stored {{procedures}} to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that {{are stored in}} the server itself (and not issued by the client application {{as is the case}} with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> and send back results as output parameters. They can call defined functions, and other stored procedures, including the same stored procedure (up to a set number of times). They can be selectively provided access to. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance. Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary.|$|E

The initial AFP pair that nucleates the alignment can occur {{at any point in}} the sequence matrix. Extensions then proceed with the next AFP that meets given distance criteria restricting the alignment to low gap sizes. The size of each AFP and the maximum gap size are required <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> but are usually set to empirically determined values of 8 and 30 respectively.

40|$|This study compares seven {{different}} methods for handling constraints in <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> models when using combination strategies to select test cases. Combination strategies {{are used to}} select test cases based on <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> models. An <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> model is {{a representation of the}} input space of the system under test via a set of parameters and values for these parameters. A test case is one specific combination of values for all the <b>parameters.</b> Sometimes the <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> model may contain parameters that are not independent. Some sub-combinations of values of the dependent parameters may not be valid, i. e., these sub-combinations do not make sense. Combination strategies, in their basic forms, do not take into account any semantic information. Thus, invalid sub-combinations may be included in test cases in the test suite. This paper proposes four new constraint handling methods and compares these with three existing methods in an experiment in which the seven constraint handling methods are used to handle a number of different constraints in different sized <b>input</b> <b>parameter</b> models under three different coverage criteria. All in all, 2568 test suites with a total of 634, 263 test cases have been generated within the scope of this experiment...|$|R

2500|$|In {{computer}} science, mathematics, management science, {{economics and}} bioinformatics, dynamic programming (also known as dynamic optimization) {{is a method}} for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time {{at the expense of}} a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space. (Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> so as to facilitate its lookup.) The technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called [...] "memoization".|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the {{electric}} charges of electrons and protons seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision {{is essential for the}} existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of strong and weak interactions within the Standard Model is based on gauge symmetries governed by the simple symmetry groups [...] and [...] which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the weak hypercharge interaction is described by an abelian symmetry [...] which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments. The observed charge quantization, namely the fact that all known elementary particles carry electric charges which appear to be exact multiples of ⅓ of the [...] "elementary" [...] charge, has led to the idea that hypercharge interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions which we observe, in particular the weak mixing angle, Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> but is also constrained by observations.|$|E
