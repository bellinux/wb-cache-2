5|$|Industrialist Mark C. <b>Honeywell</b> was a Cocolobo Club {{member who}} bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, {{expanding}} the facilities {{to include a}} small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, {{and the end of}} a jetty {{on the north side of}} the key. The key was owned by <b>Honeywell</b> until 1945. Mark and Olive <b>Honeywell</b> also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by <b>Honeywell</b> Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant <b>Honeywell</b> HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics {{were viewed as}} lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were {{carried out in the}} mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, <b>Honeywell</b> F125IN to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{introduced}} {{a number of}} advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital fly-by-wire controls, fully software-configurable avionics, <b>Honeywell</b> LCD glass cockpit flight displays, and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner. Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing 7J7 regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|Bournemouth Airport {{is among}} the busiest {{international}} airports {{in the country and}} is an important economic generator for the region. Owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group, the airport handles 800,000 passengers annually and supports around 900 full-time equivalent jobs which contribute more than £24million to the local economy. Between 2007 and 2010 the airport underwent a £45million upgrade which included {{the construction of a new}} departure terminal. Other major employers in Christchurch include: BAE Systems, Bournemouth Aviation Services Company (BASCO), Beagle Aerospace, Bournemouth International Airport Ltd, Channel Express, College of Air Traffic Control, Data Track Process Instruments, European Aviation, FR Aviation, <b>Honeywell,</b> Reid Steel, Revvo Castor Company, Sainsbury's, Siemens VAI and SELEX Communications.|$|E

5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a <b>Honeywell</b> digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by <b>Honeywell.</b> The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|Some Tornado {{variants}} carry different avionics and equipment, {{depending on}} their mission. The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, operated by Germany and Italy. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to spot radar use. German ECRs have a <b>Honeywell</b> infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, Meyer {{teamed with}} William H. Nichols of General Chemical to help fulfill {{his vision of}} a bigger, better {{chemical}} company. Meyer and Nichols combined five smaller chemical companies to create the Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation, which later became Allied Chemical Corp., and eventually became part of AlliedSignal, the forerunner of <b>Honeywell’s</b> specialty materials business. Both men have buildings named after them at <b>Honeywell’s</b> headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey.|$|R

5|$|The Adour was {{developed}} into both afterburning and non-afterburning models; the BAE Hawk, which had beaten the Jaguar {{to fulfill the}} Air Staff Target 362 trainer requirement, also adopted the non-afterburning Adour engine developed for the Jaguar. The Adour engine found use in several aircraft abroad, such as the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the Mitsubishi T-2, and the Mitsubishi F-1(which resembles the Jaguar). Even following the Jaguar's retirement in Europe, the Adour {{continues to be an}} active product with new variants being developed. As of February 2013, the Indian Air Force was considering fitting 125 Jaguars with new <b>Honeywell</b> F125IN engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to <b>Honeywell</b> Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-range}} {{committee was}} made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (<b>Honeywell</b> Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government agencies were the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards. Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.|$|E
