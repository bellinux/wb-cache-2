40|$|The {{performances}} of a Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Valve</b> (DDV) mainly {{depend on the}} characteristics of its Linear Force Motor (LFM) and the availability of accurate models of the LFM {{plays an important role in}} the whole actuation system design. The present work deals with the modelling and the experimental characterisation of a LFM. By means of a specifically designed test equipment, the force provided by the LFM of an off-the-shelf DDV is measured as a function of the coil current and of the spool position. The experimental data are compared with the results of two models: a theoretical one, based on the magnetic circuit theory, and a numerical one, based on the FEM analysis of the electromagnetic components of the system. The numerical model provided good results over a wide range of test conditions and it allowed to evaluate correction factors for the theoretical model, related to the presence of secondary paths in the magnetic fluxes and to the distortion of the magnetic flux lines...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{performance characteristics}} of {{a new type of}} direct <b>drive</b> <b>valve</b> (DDV) system driven by a piezostack actuator. The flexible beam mechanism is employed to amplify the output displacement from the piezostack actuator. After describing the operational principle of the proposed piezo DDV system, the governing equation of the whole piezo DDV system is then obtained by integrating the equations of the valve components. Based on the proposed model, significant structural components of the piezo DDV system are designed in order to achieve operational requirements (operating frequency: over 100 Hz; flow rate: 20 liter/Min.). An optimal design method is proposed for obtaining the geometry of the flexible beam mechanism by considering spool displacement, required operating frequency, and available space of the valve. After deciding the specific geometric dimensions of the piezo DDV system, a PID control algorithm is designed to enforce the spool position to the desired position trajectories by activating the piezostack actuator. Characteristics and control performances of the proposed piezo DDV system are evaluated using the MATLAB Simulink...|$|E
40|$|Aileron {{actuators}} are pivotal {{components for}} aircraft flight control system. Thus, the fault diagnosis of aileron actuators is vital in {{the enhancement of}} the reliability and fault tolerant capability. This paper presents an aileron actuator fault diagnosis approach combining principal component analysis (PCA), grid search (GS), 10 -fold cross validation (CV), and one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM). This method {{is referred to as}} PGC-SVM and utilizes the direct <b>drive</b> <b>valve</b> input, force motor current, and displacement feedback signal to realize fault detection and location. First, several common faults of aileron actuators, which include force motor coil break, sensor coil break, cylinder leakage, and amplifier gain reduction, are extracted from the fault quadrantal diagram; the corresponding fault mechanisms are analyzed. Second, the data feature extraction is performed with dimension reduction using PCA. Finally, the GS and CV algorithms are employed to train a one-versus-one SVM for fault classification, thus obtaining the optimal model parameters and assuring the generalization of the trained SVM, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four types of faults are introduced into the simulation model established by AMESim and Simulink. The results demonstrate its desirable diagnostic performance which outperforms that of the traditional SVM by comparison...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Integrated Application of Active Controls (IAAC) Technology to an Advanced Subsonic Transport Project, established as {{one element of}} the NASA/Boeing Energy Efficient Transport Technology Program. The performance assessment showed that incorporating ACT into an airplane designed to fly approximately 200 passengers approximately 2, 000 nmi could yield block fuel savings from 6 to 10 percent at the design range. The principal risks associated with incorporating these active control functions into a commercial airplane are those involved with the ACT system implementation. The Test and Evaluation phase of the IAAC Project focused on the design, fabrication, and test {{of a system that}} implemented pitch axis fly-by-wire, pitch axis augmentation, and wing load alleviation. The system was built to be flight worthy, and was planned to be experimentally flown on the 757. The system was installed in the Boeing Digital Avionics Flight Controls Laboratory (DAFCL), where open loop hardware and software tests, and a brief examination of a direct <b>drive</b> <b>valve</b> (DDV) actuation concept were accomplished. The IAAC Project has shown that ACT can be beneficially incorporated into a commercial transport airplane. Based on the results achieved during the testing phase, {{there appears to be no}} fundamental reason(s) that would preclude the commercial application of ACT, assuming an appropriate development effort is included...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} solving the dynamic response problems of a <b>driven</b> <b>valve</b> system of internal combustion engines. In this system there is a hysteresis behavior between the restoring force and the deflection for the locker arm. To treat this nonlinearity, the rigidity of each section {{is assumed to be}} the one of a partly linear spring. For the valve trains, the cam profile is complex in general. For treating a general cam profile, this paper applies a combination method of the Fourier expansion and the Laplace transform methods given by the author.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Test Active Control Technology (ACT) System laboratory tests was to verify and validate the system concept, hardware, and software. The initial lab tests were open loop hardware tests of the Test ACT System as designed and built. During {{the course of the}} testing, minor problems were uncovered and corrected. Major software tests were run. The initial software testing was also open loop. These tests examined pitch control laws, wing load alleviation, signal selection/fault detection (SSFD), and output management. The Test ACT System was modified to interface with the direct <b>drive</b> <b>valve</b> (DDV) modules. The initial testing identified problem areas with DDV nonlinearities, valve friction induced limit cycling, DDV control loop instability, and channel command mismatch. The other DDV issue investigated was the ability to detect and isolate failures. Some simple schemes for failure detection were tested but were not completely satisfactory. The Test ACT System architecture continues to appear promising for ACT/FBW applications in systems that must be immune to worst case generic digital faults, and be able to tolerate two sequential nongeneric faults with no reduction in performance. The challenge in such an implementation would be to keep the analog element sufficiently simple to achieve the necessary reliability...|$|E
40|$|Active {{control of}} {{pressure}} oscillations {{has been successfully}} applied to a lean premixed prevapourised (LPP) combustion rig operating at atmospheric conditions. The design of the rig {{is based on the}} primary stage of the Rolls-Royce RB 211 -DLE in-dustrial gas turbine. Control was achieved by modulating the fuel flow rate in response to a measured pressure signal. The feedback control is an adaptive, model-based self-tuning regu-lator (STR), which only requires the total time delay between actuation and response to achieve control. The STR algorithm achieves a reduction of up to 30 dB on the primary instability frequency. This performance was an improvement of 5 - 15 dB over an empirical control strategy (simple time-delay controller) specifically tuned to the same operating point. Initial robustness {{studies have shown that the}} STR retains control for a 20 % change in frequency and a 23 % change in air mass flow rate.

50|$|The {{pressure}} in the system must be maintained from the pump right through the pressure vessel. In smaller systems (up to about 10 mL / min) a simple restrictor can be used. This can be either a capillary tube cut to length, or a needle valve which can be adjusted to maintain pressure at different flow rates. In larger systems a back pressure regulator will be used, which maintains pressure upstream of the regulator {{by means of a}} spring, compressed air, or electronically <b>driven</b> <b>valve.</b> Whichever is used, heating must be supplied, as the adiabatic expansion of the CO2 results in significant cooling.

40|$|Much resarch on {{the dynamic}} {{response}} of <b>driven</b> <b>valve</b> systems of internal combustion engines has been reported.

Recently, to have stable motion in high speed engines, the rigidity of the valve system increases, so that the previous model cannot be applied to the engines. This paper proposes a method for obtaining the jump and bounce phenomena of the valve system with large rigidities by considering the set force of the valve spring which gives large effects on the valve response.

5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain <b>driven</b> <b>valve</b> gear {{proved to}} be {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|R
