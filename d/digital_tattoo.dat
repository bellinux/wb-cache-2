50|$|As medical {{technology}} becomes more advanced, some techniques and innovations are {{adopted by the}} body modification community. While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics, augmented reality and QR codes are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body. Hypothetical technologies such as <b>digital</b> <b>tattoo</b> interfaces would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality, bringing a transhumanist way of life into present day reality.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{life has}} become an {{extension}} of human existence, therefore everyone may now take digital life for granted. Many activities, such as communicating, finding and sharing information, etc. {{which used to be}} done through the analog media are now conducted through digital ones. However, many of us may not realize the consequences we have to bear with these online activities. An activity done in the digital environment will affect one’s real life. Being recorded and archived, these activities will be our <b>digital</b> <b>tattoo.</b> They stay forever. This <b>digital</b> <b>tattoo</b> will not only affect one’s reputation but also one’s infosphere. Some may be aware of, first, crafting information about themselves, but most do not realize the second. They are not aware that their infosphere is pretty much determined by their <b>digital</b> <b>tattoo.</b> Many search engines and websites recorded every online activity. They create personalization of information services by applying algorithms based on the archives they stored. This seems to be a convenient way to get information. However, it has its own harm. Such service prevents us from getting information beyond our habits and preferences, thus, it prevent us from having a wider perspective. Eli Periser (2011) called this filter bubble. Everyone needs to know this. Through information literacy education, librarians can help to spread the knowledge on how to maintain <b>digital</b> <b>tattoo</b> and to minimize the filter bubble...|$|E
50|$|While {{a part of}} Motorola, ATAP {{developed}} and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring <b>digital</b> <b>tattoos</b> and pills—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} the services {{and development of}} the Internet of Things, and analyzes the application of Health Information System in Community Residents Based on the Internet of Things. The Internet of things has particularly novel implications in the area of public health. This is due to (1) The rapid and widespread adoption of powerful contemporary Smartphone's; (2) The increasing availability and use of health and fitness sensors, wearable sensor patches, smart watches, wireless-enabled <b>digital</b> <b>tattoos</b> and ambient sensors; and (3) The nature of public health to implicitly involve connectivity with and the acquisition of data in relation to large numbers of individuals up to population scale. Of particular relevance in relation to the Internet of Things and public health is the need for privacy and anonymity of users. It should be noted that Internet of Things capabilities are not inconsistent with maintaining privacy, due to the focus of public health on aggregate data not individual data and broad public health interventions...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things has {{particularly}} novel implications in {{the area}} of public health. This is due to (1) the rapid and widespread adoption of powerful contemporary smartphones; (2) the increasing availability and use of health and fitness sensors, wearable sensor patches, smartwatches, wireless-enabled <b>digital</b> <b>tattoos</b> and ambient sensors; and (3) the nature of public health to implicitly involve connectivity with and the acquisition of data in relation to large numbers of individuals up to population scale. Of particular relevance in relation to the Internet of Things (IoT) and public health is the need for privacy and anonymity of users. It should be noted that IoT capabilities are not inconsistent with maintaining privacy, due to the focus of public health on aggregate data not individual data and broad public health interventions. In addition, public health information systems utilizing IoT capabilities can be constructed to specifically ensure privacy, security and anonymity, as has been developed and evaluated in this work. In this paper we describe the particular characteristics of the IoT that can play a role in enabling emerging public health capabilities; we describe a privacy- preserving IoT-based public health information system architecture; and provide a privacy evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} disorder with prominent cutaneous component. Skin lesions are of diverse morphology, of which few are specific for the disease. We describe a 30 -year-old woman with polymorphic skin lesions including papules, plaques, and nodules, {{as well as}} uncommon variants like eyelid papules, palmar and <b>digital</b> nodules, <b>tattoo</b> sarcoid, as well as scar sarcoid. The patient also had stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis, and articular as well as reticulo-endothelial system involvement manifested by enlarged mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. The presentation of polymorphic skin lesions with involvement of multiple extra-cutaneous systems is uncommon in a single patient...|$|R
