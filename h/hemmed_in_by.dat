5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E
5|$|After his {{recovery}} Sérurier took command at Livorno (Leghorn) {{but he was}} thrilled to get the order {{to return to the}} army. On 27 December 1796 he resumed command of the Mantua siege corps, replacing Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine who had also become ill. The corps consisted of 10,000 men in two divisions under Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne. On 14–15 January 1797 Bonaparte defeated József Alvinczi in the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting terrible losses on the Austrians. Meanwhile, a relief column under Giovanni Marchese di Provera reached the north side of Mantua and on 16 January there was a battle. The Mantua garrison launched a sortie led by Karl Philipp Sebottendorf that made progress at first but was beaten back by reinforcements under Claude Perrin Victor. At the same time, Sérurier and 1,500 troops at La Favorita Palace blocked Provera from joining the garrison. By noon Provera was <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> French reinforcements and at 2:00 pm he surrendered to Sérurier with 7,000 men, 22 field guns, a pontoon train and a food convoy. Afterward, Sérurier got into a dispute with Dumas, who had commanded armies but was now a mere division commander. Angry that his contributions were not recognized, Dumas sent an abusive note to the army chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and was demoted by Bonaparte. On 30 January, Wurmser began negotiations with Sérurier for the capitulation of Mantua; this was signed on 2 February 1797 by the two generals. The articles permitted Wurmser, his staff, his generals, 700 soldiers and six artillery pieces to go free, but 16,324 men of the garrison became prisoners of war.|$|E

Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone. <b>Hemmed</b> <b>in</b> here <b>by</b> the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.|$|R

Extremely optimistic forecasts were circulated by the promoters, including the assertion that the line would form part of an artery to the North of England from Bristol, when the Severn Tunnel was opened. Tourism was becoming an important factor, and the natural beauty of the Wye Valley was expected to encourage revenue from that source.|$|E
25|$|Penderecki {{explained}} this shift {{by stating that}} he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: 'The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism.

Penderecki concluded that he was 'saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition'.|$|E

West of the Kaw lived the warlike Cheyenne and Comanche, and to the north were the Pawnee, their traditional enemies. In 1825, the Kaw ceded a huge area of land in Missouri and Kansas to the United States in exchange for a promise of an annuity of $3,500 annually for twenty years. The promised annuity—to be paid in goods and services—was often late in arriving or found its way into the pockets of unscrupulous government officials and merchants. The Kaw were indifferent to the pleas of government agents and missionaries that they take up farming as their sole livelihood.|$|R
2500|$|The {{greatest}} literary artists, Hazlitt {{had pointed}} out in the essay on Godwin, give shape to their creations by infusing them with imagination. As creator of such works as Old Mortality, The Heart of Midlothian, and Ivanhoe, Scott, adhering closely to his sources, restricts his imaginative investment <b>in</b> the story, <b>hemming</b> himself <b>in</b> <b>by</b> the historical facts. Even so, he manages to bring the past to life. He is the [...] "amanuensis of truth and history" [...] by means of a rich array of characters and situations.

Duhesme and his soldiers soon found themselves in difficulties. <b>Hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> Catalan militia and regular Spanish troops, the French general attempted to capture Girona in order to open up a secure supply line from France to Barcelona. The Franco-Italian force attempted to storm the city but they were repulsed by the city militia and two small battalions of Irish regular infantry in Spanish service.

After agreeing not to fight the French for one year, the 2,000 Bavarians were permitted to march home, but the city and 168 fortress guns fell into French hands. Threatened by Jourdan's incursion, Clerfayt began shifting his army north to oppose him. This movement gave Pichegru an opportunity. Despite having a 9,200-man Bavarian garrison, Baron von Belderbusch turned over Mannheim and its 471 guns to the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle after negotiations. The Austrians were furious at their ally but could do nothing to prevent their enemies from gaining this valuable bridgehead.|$|E

After winning a bridgehead on the east bank, the northern French army under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan advanced south to the Main River. On 8 September 1795, Jourdan's northern army crossed the Rhine north of Düsseldorf. Maintaining a siege of the Bavarian garrison in Dusseldorf, {{the rest of the}} Army of Sambre and Meuse swept south as far as the Lahn River, by 20 September. <b>Hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> General of Division François Joseph Lefebvre and 12,600 French troops, Count Hompesch surrendered the Bavarian garrison at Düsseldorf on 21 September.

The local Independent Media Center produced a short video claiming to show inappropriate and violent police behavior, including backing horses into demonstrators, shoving people into the metal barricades, spraying a toxic substance at penned-in demonstrators, using abusive language, and raising nightsticks against some who couldn't move. However, NYPD spokesman Michael O'Looney denied the charges claiming that the tape was [...] "filled with special effects" [...] and that it did not prove the police had not been provoked.|$|R

Shortly this castle was given to Des Roches; and De Burgh, who knew by {{experience}} how the change of castellane often brought death to the captive, sought to escape. He gained over two of his guards, who carried him to the parish church, for he was too heavily ironed to walk, and there laid him down before the altar. They could take him no further, and the warden of the castle cruelly beat him, and brought him back; but, as before, the Bishop maintained the privileges of the sanctuary, and forced the persecutors to restore him, and though he was again <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> there <b>by</b> the sheriff, before he was starved out a party of his friends came to his rescue, and he was carried off to the Welsh hills, there remaining till recalled by {{the influence of the}} Archbishop.

50|$|In 1905, the Bavarian State Government - the Palatinate {{had belonged}} to the Kingdom of Bavaria since the Congress of Vienna - ordered the cession of the Kuhbrücker Hübel, with its railway station, seven houses on the slope side of Bahnhofsstraße (“Station Street”), seven others on Hefersweilerstraße, a few storage sheds next to the railway and the {{storehouse}} of the Consumvereine (“coöperatives”), {{to the town of}} Wolfstein. The decisive factor in favour of the amalgamation of this strip of land {{on both sides of the}} railway line, which had been opened in 1883, was economic considerations. For the goal of expanding the town’s residential area, however, it was quite useless, for the slopes east of the ceded area on the valley ﬂoor still belonged to Roßbach. Thus, until the village of Roßbach in der Pfalz along with all its Ortsteile was merged into the town of Wolfstein in 1969, the town’s foremost new building area remained the steep slope stretching up the Königsberg west of Hauptstraße (Bundesstraße 270), even after the Second World War (Röther Weg, Steinwiesen, Am Hang, Am Gericht, In der Trift, Bergstraße, Am Kirchpfad). Even this was <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> somewhat <b>by</b> the galleries at the chalk mine.|$|R
25|$|Outcalt's {{proposal}} was criticized by architect Little, who argued {{it was cut}} {{off from the rest of}} downtown, mixed parking and exhibit space in the same building, used open space rather than demolishing old and decrepit buildings, was too <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> its proposed hotel and office towers, did not provide for the expansion of City Hall or the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, failed to give the city a visual symbol of its progress (by being buried beneath the mall), and was both too big to be built swiftly and too little to provide the economic stimulus the city wanted. Despite his criticisms, a week later the Cleveland investment banking firm of Ball, Burge & Kraus said it would issue bonds or stock or a combination in order to finance construction of the hotel and office building. Both Outcalt and Little called for additional studies, and the Cleveland City Planning Commission hired consultants John T. Howard and Walter H. Blucher to provide a joint assessment of both plans.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, {{the self-proclaimed}} king's realm {{amounted}} {{to just the}} immediate region around his small town. To his west and south, he was still <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> Prome and Dala, ruled by Pagan princes, Thihathu of Prome and Kyawswa of Dala, respectively. To his east, the Martaban (Mottama) province was controlled by another rebel Wareru. To his north, Thawun Gyi {{was in charge of}} Toungoo (Taungoo). Since the king did not control any of their surrounding regions, the Pegu leadership believed that they would be low on the king's priority list, and their defensive preparations progressed slowly. However, to their surprise, the king managed to send a small army to Pegu. When the army showed up at their doorstep, they readily surrendered. They convinced the commander that it had been a misunderstanding all along, and that they remained loyal to the king. Their deception was successful. But later that night, the Pagan general and the staff died from eating the poisoned dried game meat offered to them by Akhamaman's men. After the death of the general, the remaining troops retreated. The king ordered another expedition but Pegu was now ready. The army could not take the well-stockaded town, and had to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Suvorov's {{desire to}} start the attack at 7:00 am proved to be {{impractical}} due to the Allied soldiers' exhaustion, so it was put off until 11:00 am. Scouts reported that the French were defending behind the Trebbia with advanced positions near the villages of San Nicolò, Gragnano Trebbiense and Casaliggio, from north to south. Bagration's Advance Guard forded the Tidone and attacked Dombrowski's Polish Legion south of Casaliggio at 2:00 pm, achieving some surprise. Coming from the south, a Polish battalion threatened the Russian rear, but it was quickly <b>hemmed</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> Russian infantry, the Austrian Karaczay Dragoons and Cossacks and 230 men were forced {{to lay down their}} arms. An alert French staff officer, Pierre Edmé Gautherin brought the divisions of Rusca and Victor to {{the west bank of the}} Trebbia where they stopped and drove back Bagration's troops. Rosenberg brought Schveikovsky's division into the fight while Suvorov personally rallied the shaken Russian infantry. The Russians presently gained the upper hand and compelled Rusca to pull back to the east bank of the Trebbia, which his men accomplished while maintaining their ranks. The fighting in the center began when the Levenehr Dragoons and Molchanov Cossacks clashed with some French horsemen and drove them back. Starting at 5:00 pm, Förster slowly pressed back the right wing of Victor's division. Finally the French evacuated Gragnano and fell back across the Trebbia.|$|E
