5|$|According to Brian Fallow, the New Zealand Herald Economics editor, {{business}} lobby {{groups such}} as Business New Zealand and the Greenhouse Policy Coalition (representing the <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> sector) welcomed {{the introduction of a}} temporary price cap and the principle of basing free allocations of units on the basis of intensity of production.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is <b>energy</b> <b>intensive,</b> active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

50|$|Transitioning to a {{low-carbon}} {{economy will}} cause {{shifts in the}} volume, composition, and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers, approximately half the global workforce, will undergo major changes: agriculture, forestry, fishing, <b>energy,</b> resource <b>intensive</b> manufacturing, recycling, buildings, and transport.|$|R
40|$|The need {{to reduce}} {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) losses {{as well as the}} (direct and indirect) use of fossil <b>energy</b> on <b>intensive</b> dairy farms in Europe to ecologically acceptable levels requires radical changes of the management of these farms.

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is <b>energy</b> <b>intensive,</b> and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
25|$|NaOH is {{economically}} {{competitive with}} other absorbents (e.g. Amines) used for DAC processes. DAC processes are <b>energy</b> <b>intensive.</b> Calcination (at the furnace) {{is the most}} <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> step of this process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{differential}} quantities (U, S, V, Ni) are all extensive quantities. The {{coefficients of}} the differential quantities are intensive quantities (temperature, pressure, chemical potential). Each pair {{in the equation}} are known as a conjugate pair {{with respect to the}} internal <b>energy.</b> The <b>intensive</b> variables may be viewed as a generalized [...] "force". An imbalance in the intensive variable will cause a [...] "flow" [...] of the extensive variable in a direction to counter the imbalance.|$|R
25|$|Power {{needed for}} {{levitation}} is typically not {{a large percentage}} of the overall energy consumption of a high speed maglev system. Overcoming drag, which makes all land transport more <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> at higher speeds, takes up the most energy. Vactrain technology has been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} steel, {{concrete}} and glass needed {{to construct a}} single skyscraper is large, and these materials represent {{a great deal of}} embodied energy. Skyscrapers are thus <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> buildings, but skyscrapers have a long lifespan, for example the Empire State Building in New York City, United States completed in 1931 and is still in active use.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraction}} {{and refining}} of carbon based fuels and its distribution {{is in itself}} an <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> industry contributing to CO2 emissions. In 2007 U.S. refineries consumed 39353 million kWh, 70769 million lbs of steam and 697593 million cubic feet of Natural Gas. And the refining energy efficiency for gasoline is estimated to be, at best, 87.7%.|$|E
40|$|Broadband is {{the gateway}} to  the {{networked}} economy.

50|$|The {{environmental}} impact of masonry depends {{on the type of}} material used. In general, concrete and concrete based materials are <b>intensive</b> <b>energy</b> materials to produce. However, the long durability and minimal maintenance of masonry sidings mean that less energy is required {{over the life of the}} siding.|$|R
40|$|Drinking water {{utilities}} {{in urban}} areas are facing new challenges in their real-time operation: limited water resources, <b>intensive</b> <b>energy</b> requirements, a growing population, a costly and ageing infrastructure, increasingly stringent regulations, and increased attention towards {{the environmental impact of}} water use.

25|$|Last, stress {{selected}} in step 2 {{is used as}} standard to assess phase of life separately and identify the most damaging phase. For instance, for a family car, energy consumption {{could be used as}} the single stress factor to assess each phase of life. The result shows that the most <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> phase for a family car is the usage stage.|$|E
25|$|Some {{problems}} {{that are expected to}} be an issue in this century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, these processes are <b>energy</b> <b>intensive.</b> Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} technology, solar cell {{manufacture}} {{is dependent on}} and presupposes {{the existence of a}} complex global industrial manufacturing system. This comprises not only the fabrication systems typically accounted for in estimates of manufacturing energy, but the contingent mining, refining and global transportation systems, as well as other <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> critical support systems including finance, information, and security systems. The uncertainty of that energy component confers uncertainty on any estimate of payback times derived from that estimate, considered by some to be significant.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{residential}} {{energy consumption}} {{has grown in}} Mexico despite high poverty levels. While inequalities in energy have been documented, less {{attention has been paid}} to practices of consumption. Particularly, we sustain that it is necessary to account for changes in associated behaviors, which shape energy use, such as the acquisition of electrical appliances. This paper analyzes if there is evidence of diffusion of energy practices from higher to lower-income households. We hypothesize that more <b>intensive</b> <b>energy</b> practices expand across groups beyond their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Employing a harmonized dataset of thirteen Income and Expenditure Household Surveys, we assess changes in electrical appliances and electricity consumption. Using latent class analysis, we construct energy profiles that identify underlying consumption behaviors from sociodemographic and residential characteristics. We find support for the argument that <b>intensive</b> <b>energy</b> practices expanded from high to lower socioeconomic groups. While this trend reflects improvements in living conditions in Mexico, it also highlights the environmental challenges that increasing consumption poses for sustainable development goals...|$|R
30|$|Various {{physical}} and chemical approaches are available to synthesize AuNPs [1], while almost all those methods are <b>energy</b> or capital <b>intensive.</b> What is more, many toxic chemicals including sodium borohydride (NaBH 4), surfactants, or thiol groups are involved, thus precluding the applications of the produced AuNPs in many clinical and biological areas. Therefore, {{the development of a}} clean, cost-effective, and environmentally benign process to synthesize AuNPs is in urgent demand.|$|R
25|$|Usually this crude {{glycerol}} {{has to be}} purified, typically {{by performing}} vacuum distillation. This is rather <b>energy</b> <b>intensive.</b> The refined glycerol (98%+ purity) can then be utilised directly, or converted into other products. The following announcements were made in 2007: A joint venture of Ashland Inc. and Cargill announced plans to make propylene glycol in Europe from glycerol and Dow Chemical announced similar plans for North America. Dow also {{plans to build a}} plant in China to make epichlorhydrin from glycerol. Epichlorhydrin is a raw material for epoxy resins.|$|E
25|$|Vortex tubes {{were used}} by South Africa in their Helikon vortex {{separation}} process. The gas is injected tangentially into a chamber with special geometry that further increases its rotation to a very high rate, causing the isotopes to separate. The method is simple because vortex tubes have no moving parts, but <b>energy</b> <b>intensive,</b> about 50 times greater than gas centrifuges. A similar process, known as jet nozzle, was created in Germany, with a demonstration plant built in Brazil, and they {{went as far as}} developing a site to fuel the country's nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Haber process for the production of ammonia in 1913, nitric acid was produced using the Birkeland–Eyde process, also known as the arc process. This process is based upon the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen by atmospheric oxygen to nitric oxide at very high temperatures. An electric arc was used to provide the high temperatures, and yields of up to 4% nitric oxide were obtained. The nitric oxide was cooled and oxidized by the remaining atmospheric oxygen to nitrogen dioxide, and this was subsequently absorbed in dilute nitric acid. The process was very <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> and was rapidly displaced by the Ostwald process once cheap ammonia became available.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} inconspicuously bridges {{nature and}} culture. Modern societies and cultures depend on <b>intensive</b> <b>energy</b> use from {{the extraction of}} natural resources. In fact, the industrialization process required large amounts of energy, but main sources such as oil and coal, have been gradually depleted and found to be heavily polluting the environment. Despite their environmental impacts, these resources have provided cheap and abundant power to fuel technological progress and economic growth...|$|R
50|$|The fibers are {{harvested}} from plants in long, thin bundles mainly {{through the process}} of decortication which is where the non-fibrous tissues are scraped away from the plant fibers by hand or in a machine. For the majority of cases, the leaves must be hand-picked from the plant at maturity before undergoing decortication which causes the harvesting of hard fibers to be a very <b>energy</b> and time <b>intensive</b> task.|$|R
50|$|This {{potential}} synergy {{with the}} cement industry also provides environmental benefits by simultaneously reducing the waste {{output of the}} looping process and decarbonizing cement production. Cement manufacture is <b>energy</b> and resource <b>intensive,</b> consuming 1.5 tonnes of material per tonne of cement produced. In the developing world, economic growth will drive infrastructure growth, increasing cement demand. Deploying a waste product for cement production could therefore have a large, positive environmental impact.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively, higher {{volumetric}} {{energy density}} liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268K (–252.882°C or –423.188°F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is <b>energy</b> <b>intensive.</b> The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails.|$|E
25|$|Leading by example, the European Union had {{committed}} to implementing binding legislation, {{even without a}} satisfactory deal in Copenhagen. Last December, the European Union revised its carbon allowances system called the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) designed for the post-Kyoto period (after 2013). This new stage of the system aims at further reducing greenhouse gases emitted in Europe in a binding way and at showing the commitments the EU had already done before the Copenhagen meeting. To avoid carbon leakage—relocation of companies in other regions not complying with similar legislation—the EU Commission will foresee that sectors exposed to international competition, should be granted some free allocations of CO2 emissions provided that they are {{at least at the}} same level of a benchmark. Other sectors should buy such credits on an international market. <b>Energy</b> <b>intensive</b> industries in Europe have advocated for this benchmark system in order to keep funds in investment capacities for low carbon products rather than for speculations. The European chemical industry claims here the need to be closer to the needs of citizens in a sustainable way. To comply with such commitments for a low-carbon economy, this requires competitiveness and innovations.|$|E
500|$|The name of Bintulu {{was derived}} from the local native {{language}} [...] "Mentu Ulau" [...] (picking heads). Bintulu was a small fishing village when Rajah James Brooke acquired it in 1861. Brooke later built a fort there in 1862. In 1867, the first General Council meeting (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) was convened in Bintulu. It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties. During World War II, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British later rebuilt the airstrip, and it became fully operational in 1955. The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002. Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast. Since then, Bintulu has become the centre of <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> industries such as a Malaysia LNG plant, a Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis plant, and a Bintulu combined cycle power plant. The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations, palm oil processing, wood-waste processing, and cement manufacturing. The port of Bintulu is the busiest in Sarawak. The town is also a gateway to Samalajau Industrial Park.|$|E
