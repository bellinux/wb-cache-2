40|$|In this study, the {{kinetics}} of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> synthesis {{including the}} reaction mechanism was studied {{based on the}} two-step noncatalytic method. The liquid-phase diffusion effect on the reaction process was eliminated by adjusting the stirring rate. The {{results showed that the}} two-step reaction followed a tetrahedral mechanism and conformed to second-order reaction kinetics. Nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon afforded an intermediate, containing a tetrahedral carbon center. The intermediate ultimately decomposed by elimination of the leaving group, allot ding <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate.</b> The experimental data were analyzed at different temperatures by the integral method. The kinetic equations of the each step were deduced, and the activation energy and frequency factor were obtained.

40|$|Chemotherapy can {{potentially}} be greatly improved by using nanoparticles as drug carriers to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs specifically to cancer cells. Lipid nanoparticles can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs that have low solubility in water, and target tumor {{sites in the}} body either by active, passive or triggered delivery. In this thesis, nanoparticle stability and size is optimized from an already existing lipid particle formulation {{that is based on}} a mixture of solid (stearic acid) and liquid lipid (<b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate).</b> Systematic screening of the particle formulation and synthesis process parameters {{led to the development of}} a nanostructured lipid carrier particle stabilized by a combination of surfactants, Andean QDP Ultra and Phospholipon 80 H.

40|$|Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), {{thermogravimetry}}/derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) {{and infrared}} spectroscopy (IR) techniques {{were used to}} investigate the compatibility between prednicarbate and several excipients commonly used in semi solid pharmaceutical form. The thermoanalytical studies of 1 : 1 (m/m) drug/excipient physical mixtures showed that {{the beginning of the}} first thermal decomposition stage of the prednicarbate (T (onset) value) was decreased in the presence of stearyl alcohol and glyceryl stearate compared to the drug alone. For the binary mixture of drug/sodium pirrolidone carboxilate the first thermal decomposition stage was not changed, however the DTG peak temperature (T (peak DTG)) decreased. The comparison of the IR spectra of the drug, the physical mixtures and of the thermally treated samples confirmed the thermal decomposition of prednicarbate. By the comparison of the thermal profiles of 1 : 1 prednicarbate:excipients mixtures (methylparaben, propylparaben, carbomer 940, acrylate crosspolymer, lactic acid, light liquid paraffin, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> myristyl lactate and cetyl alcohol) no interaction was observed...|$|E
40|$|Transdermal {{permeation}} of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), a metabolite of glucosamine was examined. Glucosamine salts are nutraceuticals used in {{the oral}} treatment of osteoarthritis. Sparse information is available regarding glucosamine and NAG transdermal or percutaneous transport and absorption. Permeability of NAG in various enhancer suspensions was evaluated by using shed snakeskin as a model membrane via Franz-type cell diffusion studies. Negligible permeability was observed for NAG in neat solutions of known membrane permeation enhancers ethanol, oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> {{as well as from}} saturated solutions of NAG in water or phosphate buffer. Permeability measurements obtained from saturated solutions of NAG in DMSO and phosphate buffer solutions containing ethanol at 2 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 %, and 50 % demonstrated excellent permeation. Permeability coefficients of the phosphate buffer/ethanol solutions at 5 %, 10 %, and 25 % were about threefold larger in value as those for saturated DMSO solution, whereas the 2 % and 50 % solution values were lower.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to formulate and evaluate the suitability of pluronic lecithin organogels containing flurbiprofen for topical application. Four formulations were developed using flurbiprofen, lecithin, Pluronic F 127, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> water, sorbic acid and potassium sorbate were coded as FL 1, FL 2, FL 3 and FL 4. All the formulations carried 30 % w/w of lecithin phase and 70 % w/w of Pluronic phase. The formulated organogels were evaluated for appearance and feel psychorheologically, in vitro diffusion study, drug content, viscosity and pH. Release of flurbiprofen from all formulations was monitored via dialysis membrane- 70 and Wistar rat skin as a semipermeable membrane into phosphate buffer saline (0. 2 M, pH 7. 4) using Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. The viscosities of different formulations were determined by using Brookfield Viscometer at 25 °.

40|$|Abstract 0 Organogels {{obtained}} by adding {{small amounts of}} water to a solution of lecithin in organic solvents were studied as matrices for the transdermal transport of drugs. Gels obtained from <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and cyclooctane were used (molar ratios of water to lecithin of 3 and 12, respectively). Preliminarily histological studies showed that the gels have no harmful effect when applied to the skin for prolonged periods. Data relative to the stability of the organogels with time are also presented. Scopolamine and broxaterol were used as model drugs, and the transdermal experiments were done with a Franz diffusion cell and human skin obtained from plastic surgery. The transport rate of scopo-lamine obtained with the lecithin gels was about one order of magnitude higher than that obtained with an aqueous solution of the drug at the same concentration. In contrast, the transport rates of scopolamine obtained with the microemulsion solution prior to gelation (molar ratio of water to lecithin, 0) were not different from those obtained with the gel...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{matrix type}} patch {{formulations}} of flurbiprofen using certain skin permeation enhancers [isopropyl myristate (IPM), <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (IPP) and Tween 80] were formulated, evaluated and compared. The cumulative amounts permeated and the permeation rates were {{higher for the}} prepared formulations {{as compared to the}} controls (without enhancers). The results also revealed better skin permeation characteristics of flurbiprofen using IPM than other enhancers. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the optimized formulation (F 7), calculated from the blood levels of the drug, revealed a profile with the ability to maintain adequate plasma levels for 24 h (i. e. up to the next application) : AUC (0 - 24) 10. 406 ± 1. 34 ng. h/ml, T max 1. 5 ± 0. 91 and C max 1. 3049 ± 0. 21 µg. ml - 1 -. The amount of drug bioavailable for targeting the site of action is comparable to that of market control.

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed to characterize microemulsion systems of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (IPP), water, and 2 ∶ 1 Brij 97 and 1 -butanol by different experimental techniques. A pseudoternary phase diagram was constructed using water titration method. At 45 % wt/wt surfactant system, microemulsions containing various ratios {{of water and}} IPP were prepared and identified by electrical conductivity, viscosity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FESEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results from conductivity and viscosity suggested a percolation transition from water-in-oil (water/oil) to oil-in-water (oil/water) microemulsions at 30 % wt/wt water. From DSC results, the exothermic peak of water and the endothermic peak of IPP indicated that the transition of water/oil to oil/water microemulsions occurred at 30 % wt/wt water. Cryo-FESEM photomicrographs revealed globular structures of microemulsions at higher than 15 % wt/wt water. In addition, self-diffusion coefficients determined by NMR reflected that the diffusability of water increased at higher than 35 % wt/wt water, while that of IPP was in reverse. Therefore, the results from all techniques are in good agreement and indicate that the water/oil and oil/water transition point occurred {{in the range of}} 30 % to 35 % wt/wt water...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology based on isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators based on amide and carbamate linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and ethyl laurate, isopropyl myristate and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation). The gels are all thermoreversible, and may therefore be useful in controlled release/formulation applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} suitable polymeric films for the development of diltiazem hydrochloride (diltiazem HCl) transdermal drug delivery systems. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and ethylcellulose (EC) were used as hydrophilic and hydrophobic film formers, respectively. Effects of HPMC/EC ratios and plasticizers on mechanical properties of free films were studied. Effects of HPMC/EC ratios on moisture uptake, in vitro release and permeation through pig ear skin of diltiazem HCl films were evaluated. Influence of enhancers including isopropyl myristate (IPM), <b>isopropyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (IPP), N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, and Tween 80 on permeation was evaluated. It was found that addition of EC into HPMC film produced lower ultimate tensile strength, percent elongation at break and Young’s modulus, however, addition of EC up to 60 % resulted in too hard film. Plasticization with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) produced higher strength but lower elongation as compared to triethyl citrate. The moisture uptake and initial release rates (0 – 1  h) of diltiazem HCl films decreased with increasing the EC ratio. Diltiazem HCl films (10 : 0, 8 : 2 and 6 : 4 HPMC/EC) were studied for permeation because of the higher release rate. The 10 : 0 and 8 : 2 HPMC/EC films showed the comparable permeation-time profiles, and had higher flux values and shorter lag time as compared to 6 : 4 HPMC/EC film. Addition of IPM, IPP or Tween 80 could enhance the fluxes for approx. three times while Tween 80 also shorten the lag time. In conclusion, the film composed of 8 : 2 HPMC/EC, 30 % DBP and 10 % IPM, IPP or Tween 80 loaded with 25 % diltiazem HCl should be selected for manufacturing transdermal patch by using a suitable adhesive layer and backing membrane. Further in vitro permeation and in vivo performance studies are required...|$|E
