50|$|Single shot <b>interscalenic</b> {{analgesia}} is preferably {{used during}} minor arthroscopic surgery {{because of its}} short duration but overall, {{it is still a}} useful alternative when continuous <b>interscalenic</b> analgesia cannot be performed. <b>Interscalenic</b> analgesia is most suited for the continuous infusion approach because shoulder replacement causes severe post-operative pain and the anatomic proximity of the <b>interscalenic</b> catheter to the shoulder joint provides quick relief. The <b>interscalenic</b> catheter can be used from three to five days {{depending on the type of}} surgery.|$|E
40|$|Methaemoglobinemia {{is a rare}} {{but well}} known {{complication}} {{of the use of}} prilocaine in locoregional anaesthesia. We report a case of methaemoglobinemia following the administration of a low dose of prilocaine for an <b>interscalenic</b> bloc. We suggest some hypotheses to explain this phenomenon. This case illustrates the necessity of pulse oximetry monitoring in all patients receiving prilocaine during locoregional anaesthesia. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There {{are several}} {{approaches}} for brachial plexus anesthesia: supraclavicular, infraclavicular, <b>interscalenic</b> and axillary. Out of these, the axillary approach {{is considered to}} be the safest because of the low risk of lesioning the adjacent structures, low risk of phrenic nerve blockade or of producing an iatrogenic pneumothorax. The block can be performed by one single injection at the site, by two injections or by several injection, among each nerve of the plexus. Ultrasound was introduced in regional anesthesia since 1978, being used initially as an auxiliary method to peripheral neurostimulator...|$|E
40|$|Intraspinal re-implantation after {{traumatic}} avulsion of the {{brachial plexus}} {{is a relatively}} new technique. Three different approaches to the spinal cord have been described to date, namely the posterior scapular, anterolateral <b>interscalenic</b> multilevel oblique corpectomy and the pure lateral. We describe an anatomical study of the pure lateral approach, based on our clinical experience and studies on cadavers. Avulsion of the brachial plexus from the spinal cord is the most severe form of injury to the nerves supplying the upper limbs. Recovery of function tends to be minimal and remains lim-ited even after extensive muscle and nerve trans-fers. 1 Re-implantation of the brachial plexus {{is a relatively new}} procedure with an encouraging functional outcome. 2 To date, three surgical approaches have been used, namely, the poste-rior subscapular, anterolateral interscaleni...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} thoracic artery (ITA) {{is considered}} to be the optimal conduit for surgical coronary artery revascularization. Variations in ITA anatomy are relatively common and may impact surgical results. The ITA usually arises from the intrascalenic (first) part of the subclavian artery (SCA) and, occasionally, from the <b>interscalenic</b> (second) part. Origination from the extrascalenic (third) part of the SCA is rare, with a reported incidence rate of 0. 5 % to 1. 0 % in anatomical studies, and 1. 5 % in one angiographic study. Such an aberrant ITA descends inferomedially, anterior to the distal attachment of the scalenus anterior muscle, passes posterior to the first rib and enters the thorax, from where it follows its usual course. A patient with a five-year history of in situ grafting of the left ITA to the anterior inter-ventricular artery is presented. Coronary angiography performed because of anterior wall ischemia revealed an aberrantly arising ITA from the extras-calenic part of the SCA. The implications of this ITA variant with regard to bypass surgery, postoperative angiography and subclavian vein catheterization are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic outlet {{syndrome}} (TOS) {{is due to}} compression/irritation of {{brachial plexus}} elements ("neurogenic TOS") and/or subclavian vessels ("vascular TOS") in their passage from the cervical area toward the axilla. The usual site of entrapment is the <b>interscalenic</b> triangle. TOS is a highly controversial subject in regard to its incidence, diagnostic criteria and optimal treatment. Constitutional factors [...] osseous or more often fibromuscular [...] and external factors such as trauma predispose {{to the development of}} TOS. Various clinical pictures include pain in the cervical region and arm, paresthesias, aggravated by overhead positions of the arms, hand intrinsic muscle deficit/atrophy, easy fatiguability, paleness, coldness of hand. The clinical examination may be entirely normal or show cervical and scapular muscle spasm, tenderness of supraclavicular area, radial pulse attenuation upon positional maneuvers, sensory and/or motor deficit, usually of C 8 /T 1 distribution. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation and absence of other relevant pathology. Sometimes TOS can enhance symptoms consecutive to cervical or supraclavicular lesions. Cervical spine and distal peripheral nerves are investigated by radiological and electrophysiological studies. Unless there is significant motor deficit or subclavian artery compression, the treatment should be kept conservative as long as possible, by adapted physical therapy. In case of neurological deficit or symptoms unresponsive to medical treatment, the patients will [...] like in other nerve entrapment syndromes [...] be helped by decompressive surgery, nowadays preferably performed via an anterior supraclavicular approach.

40|$|Introduction: Shoulder {{surgery is}} often {{performed}} with the patient in the so called “beach-chair position” with elevation of {{the upper part of}} the body. The anesthetic procedure can be general anesthesia and/or regional block, usually <b>interscalenic</b> brachial plexus block. We present a case of brachial plexus palsy with a possible mechanism of traction based on the electromyographic and clinical findings, although a possible contribution of nerve block cannot be excluded. Presentation of the case: We present a case of a 62 year-old female, that suffered from shoulder fracture-dislocation. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed in the so-called “beach-chair” position, under combined general-regional anesthesia. In the postoperative period complete motor brachial plexus palsy appeared, with neuropathic pain. Conservative treatment included analgesic drugs, neuromodulators, B-vitamin complex and physiotherapy. Spontaneous recovery appeared at 11 months. Discusion: in shoulder surgery, there may be complications related to both anesthetic technique and patient positioning/surgical maneuvers. Regional block often acts as a confusing factor when neurologic damage appears after surgery. Intraoperative maneuvers may cause eventual traction of the brachial plexus, and may be favored by the fixed position of the head using the accessory of the operating table in the beach-chair position. Conclusion: When postoperative brachial plexus palsy appears, nerve block is a confusing factor that tends to be attributed as the cause of palsy by the orthopedic surgeon. The beach chair position may predispose brachial plexus traction injury. The head and neck position should be regularly checked during long procedures, as intraoperative maneuvers may cause eventual traction of the brachial plexus...|$|E
