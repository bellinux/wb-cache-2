50|$|The {{history of}} <b>average</b> <b>clauses</b> began with cargo insurance. Here, if a {{proportion}} of a cargo had to be thrown overboard in storm to save the ship, {{the owners of the}} remaining cargo would jointly make good the loss to the owner of the cargo thrown overboard. The share each of the owners would pay would be based on their proportion of the total value of cargo. This is commonly termed the law of <b>general</b> <b>average.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{a methodology}} of cutting logs that involves both their classification {{and the establishment}} of cutting models for different diametrical classes. The software MaxiTora was employed aiming the optimization of cutting logs. A total of 80 logs of Pinus sp had been selected with diameter that varied from 24 cm to 33 cm, gathering four diametrical classes with 20 logs each. In each diametrical class, the logs had been separate in two lots with 10 units, where the first lot was submitted to conventional cutting and the second lot was submitted to the programmed cutting. For each log the effective time of cut was recorded until the last lumber piece was edged. For the conventional cutting system, the efficiency reached from the same cutting system varied from 9. 71 to 11. 22 m 3 /operator. day and the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded to 10. 18 m 3 /operator/day. In the programmed cutting system, the efficiency reached through the same cutting system varied from 7. 78 to 8. 99 m 3 /operator. day, while the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded the 8. 07 m 3 /operator. day. The <b>general</b> <b>average</b> efficiency achieved in the programmed sawing process was smaller in relation to <b>general</b> <b>average</b> efficiency obtained with conventional sawing process.

To test their effectiveness at this, we measure the constrainedness of a problem during search. We run experiments in several different domains, using both random and non-random problems. In each case, we observe a constrainedness "knife-edge" in which critically constrained problems tend to remain critically constrained. We show that this knife-edge is predicted by a theoretical lower-bound calculation. We also observe a very simple scaling with problem size for various properties measured during search including the ratio of clauses to variables, and the <b>average</b> <b>clause</b> size. Finally, we use this picture of search to propose some branching heuristics for propositional satisfiability...|$|R
