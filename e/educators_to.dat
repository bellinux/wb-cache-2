25|$|The {{difficulty}} and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led <b>educators</b> <b>to</b> question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas.

25|$|The {{high point}} of HSLDA's {{existence}} was its {{central role in the}} 1994 defeat of language in bill H.R. 6.

HSLDA used their grassroots lobbying system in each of the 50 states which coordinated members to contact their legislators about pending legislation. Their members overloaded the phone switchboards at Capitol Hill, and through the efforts of their members and other organizations, the bill was amended to remove the problematic language.|$|E

In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work. In the mid-2000s (decade), the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration was placing a heavier impetus upon <b>educators</b> <b>to</b> make students proficient in collaborative work, inspiring even greater interest in wikis being used in the classroom.|$|E
25|$|According to Doering, Beach and O'Brien, {{a future}} English {{curriculum}} needs {{to recognize a}} major shift in how adolescents are communicating with each other. Curriculum uses of social networking services also can include sharing curriculum-related resources. Educators tap into user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for students. Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students, teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative, authentic and flexible, non-linear learning experiences. Some social networks, such as English, baby! and LiveMocha, are explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment. The new Web 2.0 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing, interaction, creation, research on a global scale, enabling <b>educators</b> <b>to</b> share, remix, and repurpose curriculum resources. In short, social networking services can become research networks as well as learning networks.|$|E
25|$|The Aosta Valley is {{nowadays}} {{the only}} {{region of the}} Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An {{amendment to the constitution}} of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires <b>educators</b> <b>to</b> promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 1917, Adams and {{his entire}} Juvenile Band were {{inducted}} into the United States Navy, thus becoming the first African-Americans to receive official musical appointments in the U.S. Navy {{since at least the}} War of 1812 and making Adams the navy’s first black bandmaster. It was an exceptional situation inspired by exceptional circumstance: the need to build a bridge between an all-white naval administration and a predominantly black population. Adams used his authority as bandleader and Chief Petty Officer with the navy as a source of power, wealth, and influence. Their induction not only helped to defuse the racial tension that plagued the navy’s presence on the island during World War I, but the band, and Adams in particular, functioned as <b>educators</b> <b>to</b> naval administrators about the needs and attitudes of Virgin Islanders. Further, Adams continued to grow into his role as a social leader on the islands, serving as an officer of the local chapter of the Red Cross, helping to found the public library in Charlotte Amalie, and developing the islands’ public school music education program.|$|E
