5|$|Daspletosaurus <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to {{the much}} larger and more recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex. Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.|$|E

5|$|Lactifluus volemus <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two {{can be distinguished}} more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E
5|$|Neurolinguistics <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to {{the field}} of psycholinguistics, which seeks to {{elucidate}} the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.|$|E
5|$|Palms in {{the genus}} Calyptronoma have pinnately {{compound}} leaves and large, solitary stems 4 to 15 metres (13 to 49ft) tall. The genus is endemic to the Greater Antilles, inhabiting wet areas near streams. Calyptronoma <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Central American genus Calyptrogyne.|$|E

50|$|Bromsgroveia <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Ctenosauriscus, and {{together}} with a few other genera they make up Ctenosauriscidae. The ctenosauriscids <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the poposaurids, as shown by a few shared derived characteristics. The pelvic girdle in Bromsgroveia unites this taxon with Ctenosauriscus, Lotosaurus, Arizonasaurus, and Hypselorhachus.|$|R

5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{with the}} spinner shark (C. brevipinna), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the graceful shark, the blacktip shark, and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E

This interpretation <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, a foil for Prospero, <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax as {{giving voice to}} peoples, particularly women, recovering {{from the effects of}} colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E
5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
