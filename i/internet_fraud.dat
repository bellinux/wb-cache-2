25|$|The Internet {{can also}} be {{exploited}} for activities such as terrorism, <b>internet</b> <b>fraud</b> and pedophilia. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous. These conspiracies carry concerns for security and protection. From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room child protection procedure based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task. In other areas, it is observed that the Semantic Web has been involved in tasks such as personal data protection, which helps to prevent fraud.|$|E
25|$|<b>Internet</b> <b>fraud</b> may be by {{claiming}} a chargeback {{which is not}} justified ("friendly fraud"), or {{carried out by the}} use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either online or offline. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.|$|E
25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, state {{attorneys}} general have pursued consumer rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, <b>Internet</b> <b>fraud,</b> and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E

Lucas Introna was the associate editor. Mike Chiasson and James Backhouse served as reviewers. <b>Internet</b> auction <b>fraud</b> in the information systems literature is conducted at the individual level of analysis, thereby limiting its focus to the choices of individual traders or trading dyads. The criminology literature, in contrast, recog-nizes that social and community factors are equally important influences on the perpetration and prevention of crime. We employ social disorganization theory as a lens to explain how online auction communities address auction fraud and how those communities interact with formal authorities. We show how communities may defy, coexist, or cooperate with the formal authority of auction houses. These observations are supported by a qualitative analysis of three cases of online anticrime communities operating in different auction product categories. Our analysis extends aspects of social disorgani-zation theory to online communities. We conclude that community-based clan control may operate in concert with authority-based formal control to manage the problem of <b>Internet</b> auction <b>fraud</b> more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This {{increase}} in e−commerce has driven {{the need to}} create an online payment system. Unfortunately, {{there are a lot}} of flaws and <b>internet</b> <b>frauds.</b> Cyber−criminals have benefited from on−line banking (OB). We try to predict how hacking tools might evolve. We briefly survey the state−of−the−art tools developed by black−hat hackers and conclude that they could be automated dramatically. To demonstrate the feasibility of our predictions and prove that many two−factor authentication schemes can be bypassed, we have analysed banking and modern payments system security. In this research we review different payment protocols and security methods that are being used to run banking systems. We survey some of the popular systems that are being used today, with a deeper focus on the chips, cards, NFC, authentication etc. In addition, we also discuss the weaknesses in the systems that can compromise the customer's trust...|$|R

This paper presents a new dynamic key generation scheme that facilitates a fraud prevention mechanism.

It also eliminates the need for storing a long-term shared key which makes the system insecure during transactions. We show that the new scheme is secure against various kinds of attacks.

40|$|Prototypical {{instances}} of disinformation include deceptive advertis-ing (in business and in politics), government propaganda, doctored photographs, forged documents, fake maps, <b>internet</b> <b>frauds,</b> fake websites, and manipulated Wikipedia entries. Disinformation can cause significant harm {{if people are}} misled by it. In order to address this critical threat to information quality, we first need to understand exactly what disinformation is. This paper surveys the various analyses of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include {{things that are not}} disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude important forms of disinformation, such as true disinforma-tion, visual disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation. After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of misleading. Finally, in addition to responding to Floridi’s claim that such a precise analysis of disinformation is not necessary, it briefly discusses how this analysis can help us develop techniques for detecting disinformation and policies for deterring its spread...|$|R
