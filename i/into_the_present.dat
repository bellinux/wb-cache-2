5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} in 1972, Highway427 follows {{what was}} originally a two lane roadway known as Highway27, {{as well as}} a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway7 over the following twenty years. A short arterial extension was later built, though this section is designated as York Regional Road99 (Zenway Boulevard). Plans have been announced to extend Highway427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive; construction will begin in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.|$|E
5|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Like most of {{the smaller}} Cistercian houses, {{comparatively}} {{little is known about}} the internal history of the abbey. In its early years Cleeve received grants of land and property from local lords and the Crown to supplement its initial endowment and in the prosperous years of the thirteenth century grew steadily, reaching 26monks in 1297. The abbey held various local churches, including those at Cleeve, Queen Camel, Woolavington while also holding the rectory of Lundy. The abbey was also responsible for the chapel of Our Lady between Old Cleeve and what is now Blue Anchor; however although this has since disappeared, the inn for pilgrims attending the chapel has been expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Chapel Cleeve Manor.|$|E
5|$|Radstock {{was one of}} the {{missions}} established in 1913 by the Downside community. A temporary building of thin wooden beams and asbestos blocks was erected in 1913, and dedicated to St Hugh. Its altar rails and benches came from Prior Park. Dom Mackey was succeeded in 1918 by Dom Ambrose Agius, who acquired a disused printing works, formerly a barn and converted it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> church in Westfield, which opened in 1929. It was rebuilt after a serious fire in 1991. It has a statue of the patron on its façade.|$|E

5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid.

5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years {{in a way that}} makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day with Taxi Driver (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game, while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves and skills to progress through the adventure. Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the old and young renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E

In particular, parameterized convection-diffusion problems are considered, where the parameter appears in the coefficients of the partial differential equation. Moreover, the presence {{of one or more}} rigid bodies is assumed inside the domain. Both the theory (existence, differentiability, optimality criteria) is investigated and the numerical solution (projected gradient scheme) of such problems is carried out. Finally, it is shown that optimizing the efficiency of a rotating propeller fits <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> framework and results of corresponding numerical experiments are given. 1...|$|R
