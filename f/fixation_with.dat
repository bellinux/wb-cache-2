25|$|Sonnet 72 is a {{continuation}} from Sonnet 71. Both sonnets are an anticipatory plea regarding death and the afterlife from the writer to the reader. The overarching subject of Sonnet 72 is The Poet's <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> how he will be remembered after death. Subsequently the tone remains bleak and self-depreciating.|$|E
25|$|Growing up in {{a wealthy}} family, Humbert meets his teenage sweetheart, Annabel Leigh, and they begin a romance but Annabel's family moves away before the {{adolescent}} couple {{has the opportunity}} to have sex. Annabel dies shortly thereafter of typhus. As an adult, Humbert develops a hebephilic <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> girls ages 9 to 14 whom he refers to as nymphets. He claims the cause of his fixation is the grief he experienced over Annabel's death in his youth.|$|E
25|$|According {{to women}} in his life, Ridgway had an insatiable sexual appetite. His three ex-wives and several ex-girlfriends {{reported}} that Ridgway demanded sex from them several times a day. Often, {{he would want to}} have sex in a public area or in the woods. Ridgway himself admitted to having a <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> sex workers, with whom he had a love-hate relationship. He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. It has been speculated that Ridgway was torn between his uncontrollable lusts and his staunch religious beliefs.|$|E

40|$|This study adopts four {{facets of}} visual {{aesthetics}} (i. e., simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, craftsmanship) {{to explain how}} they relate with users’ gaze patterns, based on how much they fixate on certain points, {{as well as how}} fast and how much distance their eyes cover. On a sample of 23 experienced users in online shopping, we collect eye-tracking data while looking at high, neutral, and low appealing websites, and then register their perceptions on visual aesthetics towards those websites. Findings show different patterns of gaze behavior related with users’ perceptions on visual aesthetics. Short <b>fixations</b> <b>with</b> high saccade show high simplicity, while high fixation variance and high backtrack shows high diversity. Short <b>fixations</b> <b>with</b> high backtrack show high colorfulness. Low saccade velocity with high skewness shows high craftsmanship. We contribute towards the need of automatizing the process of understanding users’ perceptions of visual aesthetics, as {{we might be able to}} predict the user behavior in real time in the future...|$|R

25|$|Many railfans have a <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> steam locomotives, which {{sometimes}} also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these people move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E

500|$|While {{convergent}} {{evolution is}} often illustrated with animal examples, {{it has often}} occurred in plant evolution. For instance, C4 photosynthesis, {{one of the three}} major carbon-fixing biochemical processes, has arisen independently up to 40 times. About 7,600 plant species of angiosperms use [...] carbon <b>fixation,</b> <b>with</b> many monocots including 46% of grasses such as maize and sugar cane, and dicots including several species in the Chenopodiaceae and the Amaranthaceae.|$|E
40|$|Binocular {{coordination}} {{of the eyes}} during reading was examined. Fixation disparity greater than one character occurred on 47 % of <b>fixations,</b> <b>with</b> the disparity being predominantly uncrossed (39 %), though {{a small proportion of}} fixations were crossed. The average magnitude of disparity, measured at the end of fixation, was 1. 1 characters for all fixations. For the 47 % of non-aligned fixations the average magnitude of disparity was 1. 9 characters. Vergence movements that reduced fixation disparity occurred during fixations, and their magnitude was positively correlated <b>with</b> <b>fixation</b> duration. Finally, eye dominance did not modulate fixation disparity magnitude or the proportion of disparate fixation...|$|R

500|$|The Stephanides lineage is from Bithynios, {{a village}} in Asia Minor where the Greek {{middleman}} minority is inclined to be in uneasy relations with the Turkish majority. The people of the middleman minority do not assimilate because of their small mercantile businesses and because their host country is antagonistic towards them. Desdemona, a first-generation Greek immigrant, reflects a <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> not assimilating. She tells her husband Lefty {{that she does not}} want to become an [...] "Amerikanidha" [...] and is frightened that her cousin Lina's husband, Jimmy Zizmo, is a Pontian Greek. Desdemona considers Pontians to be adulterated Greeks because Pontians inhabited Turkey, where some became Muslims and did not follow the Greek Orthodox religion.|$|E

500|$|After a {{promising}} performance in round one, Watts played inconsistently {{the next few}} matches and played {{with a lack of}} intensity, according to former Richmond and Western Bulldogs forward, Nathan Brown. Pressure mounted on him with the media debating whether he should be dropped for the round seven match against [...] at the Adelaide Oval. Roos defended his position and said Watts would maintain his position in the side, and that he could not understand the public's <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> Watts and his form. He turned his form around in the seventeen point win against Richmond at the MCG in round nine where he kicked three goals and recorded a career-high eleven marks; he was pivotal in the win and settled into a mid-forward role {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} visual word {{recognition}} studies how people read individual words. A key technique in studying how individuals read text is eye tracking. This {{has revealed that}} reading is performed {{as a series of}} eye <b>fixations</b> <b>with</b> saccades between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead fixate to some words while apparently filling in the missing information using context. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in studying the Human Visual System (HVS) to supplement and improve the performance of computer vision tasks. A major challenge for current visual saliency models is predicting saliency in cluttered scenes (i. e. high false positive rate). In this paper, we propose a fixation patch detector that predicts image patches that contain human <b>fixations</b> <b>with</b> high probability. Our proposed model detects sparse <b>fixation</b> patches <b>with</b> an accuracy of 84 % and eliminates non-fixation patches with an accuracy of 84 % demonstrating that low-level image features can indeed be used to short-list and identify human fixation patches. We then show how these detected fixation patches {{can be used as}} saliency priors for popular saliency models, thus, reducing false positives while maintaining true positives. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed approach allows state-of-the-art saliency methods to achieve better prediction performance on benchmark datasets...|$|R

500|$|Yo'nal Ahk III, {{also known}} as Ruler 5, was likely the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II, based on Yo'nal Ahk III's <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> venerating the {{mortuary}} temple of Itzam K'an Ahk II. According to Walter Robert Thurmond Witschey and Clifford T. Brown, his name translates to [...] "Black House Great Turtle". Yo'nal Ahk III ascended to the throne of Piedras Negras on March 10, 758 AD (9.16.6.17.1 7 Imix 19 Wo in the Long Count), {{following the death of}} Itzam K'an Ahk II. Not much is known about the ruler, nor his successor Ha' K'in Xook; Flora Clancy refers to both reigns as [...] "shadowy". James L. Fitzsimmons argues that Yo'nal Ahk III {{seems to have been a}} weaker ruler when compared to the reign of Itzam K'an Ahk II because Yo'nal Ahk III erected few monuments, and he did not reinforce his power on a larger scale, choosing only to do so at local polities like El Cayo and La Mar.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} has been {{described}} as heralding [...] "a new era of experimentalism" [...] for Bowie. [...] "Station to Station" [...] was in two parts: a slow, portentous piano-driven march, introduced by the sound of an approaching train juxtaposed with Earl Slick's agitated guitar feedback, followed by an up-tempo rock/blues section. In 1999 Bowie told UNCUT magazine, [...] "Since Station To Station the hybridization of R and electronics had been a goal of mine". Despite the noise of a train in the opening moments, Bowie says that the title refers not so much to railway stations as to the Stations of the Cross, while the line [...] "From Kether to Malkuth" [...] relates to mystical places in the Kabbalah, mixing Christian and Jewish allusions. <b>Fixation</b> <b>with</b> the occult was further evident in such phrases as [...] "white stains", the name of a book of poetry by Aleister Crowley. The lyrics also gave notice of Bowie's recent drug use ("It's not the side effects of the cocaine / I'm thinking that it must be love"). With its krautrock influence, it was the album's clearest foretaste of Bowie's subsequent ''.|$|E
500|$|Wentz {{referred}} to [...] "I Don't Care" [...] as a [...] "narcissist's anthem" [...] {{that addresses the}} current generation's short attention span. Wentz further explored the subjects of narcissism and apathy in [...] "(Coffee's for Closers)", as Stump explained, [...] "The past decade has been totally about 'me.' It's totally about 'Oh, I'm sad. I want this. I know somebody who knows this person. Me me me me me,' so that's what that song is about." [...] Additionally, [...] "America's Suitehearts" [...] discusses society's <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> celebrities {{and the desire to}} let them do no wrong.

The title is a reference to the 27 Club, a group of influential musicians, including Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Jim Morrison, who all {{died at the age of}} 27. Wentz felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle, and was [...] "stoked" [...] to make it to his 28th birthday. Stump added [...] "There was a countdown clock and everything. I remember, our manager called me up on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'" ...|$|E

500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E

[...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Cinema's reinvigorated <b>fixation</b> <b>with</b> the living dead suggests {{that we are in the}} grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end." ...|$|E

His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many including Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Morgan Russell, Patrick Henry Bruce, Der Blaue Reiter, August Macke, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and Lyonel Feininger. Apollinaire was strongly influenced by Delaunay’s theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism.

40|$|Abstract】Intraarticular {{nonunion}} of tibial plateau is rare. In the literature, only 9 {{patients were}} found to be treated for intraarticular tibial plateau nonunion and they got varying results. Internal <b>fixation</b> along <b>with</b> bone grafting was done as a standard treatment in all cases. We treated 4 different profile cases of intraarticular tibial plateau nonunion in our institution by 4 different methods. We treated these cases with plaster of paris cast, internal <b>fixation</b> along <b>with</b> bone graft, arthrodesis with K-nail and total knee replacement. Case 1 was treated with plaster of paris (POP) cast as the patient refused surgery. The fracture was united and the patient was fully satisfied with full range of motion despite valgus malalignment. Case 2 was managed with open reduction internal <b>fixation</b> along <b>with</b> bone grafting. The patient had a good union and got full range of motion at the knee joint. Case 3 was treated with total knee arthroplasty due to her old age and got satisfactory result. Case 4 was an infected nonunion. Arthrodesis was done and the patient could walk with full weight bearing independently. We conclude that internal <b>fixation</b> along <b>with</b> bone grafting may not be suitable in all cases of intraarticular nonunion of tibial plateau. Causes of nonunion, present condition and range of motion of the knee joint, as well as the age of patient should be all considered and the treatment should be individualised according to each patient抯 situation.
