5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly <b>in</b> <b>currency.</b> Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged <b>in</b> <b>currency</b> speculation.|$|E

Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas.

Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. However, local households are restricted in their ability to diversify globally.

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Frederick, {{the effects of the}} Seven Years' War and the gaining of Silesia greatly changed the economy. The {{circulation}} of depreciated money kept prices high. To revalue the Thaler, the Mint Edict of May 1763 was proposed. This stabilized the rates of depreciated coins that would not be accepted and provided for the payments of taxes <b>in</b> <b>currency</b> of prewar value. This was replaced in northern Germany by the Reichsthaler, worth one-fourth of a Conventionsthaler. Prussia used a Thaler containing one-fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver. Many other rulers soon followed the steps of Frederick in reforming their own currencies â€” this resulted in a shortage of ready money, thus lowering prices.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nationsâ€”a 'good' that could not be valued <b>in</b> <b>currency</b> alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E
