50|$|Direct {{sampling}} of volcanic gas sampling is often {{done by a}} method involving an <b>evacuated</b> <b>flask</b> with caustic solution, first used by Robert W. Bunsen (1811-1899) and later refined by the German chemist Werner F. Giggenbach (1937-1997), dubbed Giggenbach-bottle. Other methods include collection in evacuated empty containers, in flow-through glass tubes, in gas wash bottles (cryogenic scrubbers), on impregnated filter packs and on solid adsorbent tubes.|$|E
50|$|An {{absolute}} vacuum produces a pressure difference of one atmosphere, approximately 14 psi, {{over the surface}} of the glass. The energy contained within an implosion is defined by the pressure difference and the volume <b>evacuated.</b> <b>Flask</b> volumes can change by orders of magnitude between experiments. Whenever working with liter sized or larger flasks, chemists should consider using a safety screen or the sash of a flow hood to protect them from shards of glass, should an implosion occur. Glassware can also be wrapped with spirals of tape to catch shards, or wrapped with webbed mesh more commonly seen on scuba cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Schlenk flask is a round bottom, pear-shaped, or tubular flask with {{a ground}} glass joint and a side arm. The side arm contains a valve, usually a greased stopcock, {{used to control}} the flask's exposure to a manifold or the atmosphere. This allows a material {{to be added to}} a flask through the ground glass joint, which is then capped with a septum. This operation can, for example, be done in a glove box. The flask can then be removed from the glove box and taken to a Schlenk line. Once connected to the Schlenk line, the inert gas and/or vacuum {{can be applied to the}} flask as required. While the flask is connected to the line under a positive pressure of inert gas, the septum can be replaced with other apparatus, for example a reflux condenser. Once the manipulations are complete, the contents can be vacuum dried and placed under a static vacuum by closing the side arm valve. These <b>evacuated</b> <b>flasks</b> can be taken back into a glove box for further manipulation or storage of the flasks' contents.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an analytical method with improved preci-sion {{for measuring the}} concentration of neon dissolved in water. Measurements were calibrated by isotope dilution, with addition of a 22 Ne spike directly to the <b>evacuated</b> sample <b>flask</b> prior to water collection. The use of glass flasks for water sampling, with flushing of air from the system by CO 2, greatly reduced the chance of contamina-tion. Dissolved gases were extracted from the water sam-ple by equilibration with a headspace and cryogenically processed to remove interferences. The 22 Ne/ 20 Ne ratio was then measured on a quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in static mode. Mass fractionation by the system was accounted for by frequent analyses of the 22 Ne/ 20 Ne ratio in air. We routinely obtained precisions of ± 0. 13 % based on the standard deviation of duplicate field samples. Accuracy of the method, {{in the form of}} possible system-atic offsets that could skew all the data, was assessed to be ± 0. 18 %, excluding a possible ± 0. 2 % error in the esti-mate of the Ne concentration of air...|$|R
30|$|A 50 – 60  nm {{polymeric}} film consisting of 10  % PEGMA and 90  % PMMA was grafted to the silanized {{surfaces of the}} slides according to the following protocol: The silanized slides were placed in a suited reaction vessel which was adjusted in a desiccator and brought to inert gas atmosphere. Per glass slide, 43.75  mmol (14.4  mL) poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA, Mw ≈  360  g/mol, n ≈  5, Sigma Aldrich, Germany), 393.75  mmol (41.9  mL) MMA (Merck, Germany), 2.20  mmol (455  μL) 1, 1, 4, 7, 7 -pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA, Merck, Germany) and 19.8  mmol (3.1  mL) tri(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (TEGMME, Merck, Germany) were dissolved in 185  mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in a nitrogen flask. The solution was degassed by <b>evacuating</b> the <b>flask</b> and flooding it with inert gas three times. 2.20 mmol (220  mg) CuCl (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) were added in inert gas counter stream. The solution was stirred until the copper salt was completely dissolved. The solution was then quickly filled into the reaction vessel inside the desiccator. The desiccator was again thoroughly evacuated and flooded with inert gas three times. The polymerization was left to react for 20  h at room temperature. Subsequently, the glass slides were washed five times for 5  min each with DMSO, two times for 5  min each with methanol, and two times for 10  min each with water. After rinsing with acetone, the surfaces were dried in a stream of nitrogen. The resulting polymer layer thickness can be verified via ellipsometry if a piece of silanized Si(100) wafer is processed in the same reaction vessel [22, 28].|$|R
40|$|Studies {{by others}} {{have shown that}} the growth-inhibiting {{properties}} of amphotericin B for susceptible fungi and yeasts are associated with the antibiotic's capacity to injure the organism's membrane. There is a resultant loss of stored metabolites from the cell. We have observed partial ysis of Cocddioides immitis endospores xposed for 24 hr. to 2 " 0 ~tg. /ml. amphotericin B, which is consistent with findings on alteration of the membrane. Endospores so-treated o not grow. However, even after treatment with 4. 0 ~g. ]ml. of the antibiotic for 5 days, the capacity to grow is restored to the cells by furnishing them with approximately 0 - 6 mg. ]ml. cysteine or glutathione. These nutrients apparently do not react with the antibiotic per se but appear to nullify its effect by lowering the oxidation-reduction potential of the growth medium. In this regard amphotericin hibition may also be overcome by <b>evacuating</b> air from <b>flasks</b> with antibiotic-containing medium. Relatedly, amphotericin-treated en ospores do not show endogenous respiration but this function too is restored by the addition ofcysteine. However, endospores treated with amphotericin and cysteine do not spherulate, but produce the mycelial growth form. This conversion may be associated in part with altered glucose metabolism or a reduced E h environment established by cysteine or hypobaric onditions.
