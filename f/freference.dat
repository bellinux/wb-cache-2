40|$|A six-month {{study was}} {{conducted}} in southeastern Kenya to determine the influence of varying bush canopy cover on dietary selection and nutrition of mature esophageally fistulated heifers. Replicated moderately stocked paddocks (2. 25 ha) each, were grazedonedav even' 28 - 30 days from June to November, 1982. Treatment paddocks were designated light, moderate and heavy bush conditions with 12. 8, 31. 5 and 49. 8 % total canopy cover, respectively. Acacia Senegal, Cordia ovalis and Grewia villosa were the primary woody vegetation whi ch created treatment effect. Digitaria macroblephara increased in composition with increasing canopy cover while Chloris roxburghiana decreased. Heifer diets were dominated by grass and grasslikes irrespective of seasons. Animals ate more grass, less forbs and least browse across pastures and in all seasons. Animals consumed less grass and grasslike as canopy cover increased. Digitaria macroblephara and Chloris roxburghiana dominated animal diets throughout the study. Although more than 18 woody species were on offer only three species, Acacia Senegal, Hermania alhiensis and Boscia sp. were selected by animals. These species constituted less than 1 % of the animal diets. When green, animals ate Commelina bengalensis and TaJinum kafrum forbs along with grasses. Diets during the long dry season were not diverse as for the wet season. Digitaria macroblephara, Chloris roxburghiana and Sporobolus pellucides were the major grass selected by the heifers, whereas Bothriochloa inscnipt a was least preferred grass. <b>Freference</b> ratios indicated that cattle preferred grass and grasslikes, forbs and browse in that order. Boscia sp. was the most preferred browse while Talinum kafrum, Commelina bengalensis and Asparagus sp. were the most preferred forbs. Although Acacia sp. and Hermania alhiensis dominated the studv site, they ranked least in diet preference order. Further ecological {{research is needed to determine}} the influence by these woody species on herbage production in order to recommend the economic advantage of these dominant species. All the dietary nutrients met the maintenance requirements of the cattle throughout the study, except for crude protein which was deficient in August and September. There appears to be potential problem for rumen carbon:nitrogen (C:N) balance in cattle due to the relatively high DE values in relation to nitrogen content of the diets...|$|E

To avoid {{exhaustive}} searching,data structures called indexes are builton the database prior to serving queries. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known problem for indexes:in spaces with sufficiently concentrated distance histograms,no index out performs an exhaustives can of the database. In recent years,a number of index es for approximate proximity searching have been proposed. These are able to cope with the curse of dimensionality inexchangefor returning an answer that might beslightly different from the correctone. In this paper we show that many of those recent indexes can be understood as variants of a simple general model basedon K-nearest reference signatures. A set o <b>freferences</b> is chosen from the database,and the signature of each object consists of the K references nearest to the object. At query time,the signature of the query is computed and the search examines only the objects whose signature is close enough to that of the query. Many known and novelindexes are obtained by considering different ways to determine how much detail the signature records(e. g.,justthesetofnearestreferences, or also their proximity order to the object, oral so their distances to the object,and soon), how the similarity between signatures is defined,and how the parameters are tuned. In addition,we introduce a space-efficient representation for those families of indexes, making it possible to search very large databases in main memory. Small indexes are cache friendly,inducing faster queries. We perform exhaustive experiments comparing several known and new indexes that derive from our framework,evaluatingtheir time performance,memory usage,and quality of approximation. The best indexes out perform the state of the art,offering an attractive balance between all these aspects,and turn out to be excellent choices in many scenarios. Our framework gives high flexibility to design new indexes. FB 0001,Conicyt,Chile and CONACyTGrant 179795 Mexic...|$|R
