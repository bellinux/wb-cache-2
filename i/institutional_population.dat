40|$|Objectives: To {{examine whether}} cold weather affects the <b>institutional</b> <b>{{population}}</b> {{more than the}} community-dwelling population in terms of morbidity requiring hospital admission. Methods: Residence-based hospital discharge data were used to compile excess winter hospitalization (EWH) index for the older population (aged 65 years and above) living in institutions (residential care home for the elderly [RCHE] population) and the community-dwelling elderly population in Hong Kong. To separate the influence of influenza on the cold-related hospital admissions, episodes because of influenza were excluded from this study. Results: In 2009, the EWH index for the RCHE population was 22. 93 % (95 % CI: 20. 80 %- 25. 09 %), which was much higher than that for the community-dwelling population (14. 09 %, 95 % CI: 13. 11 %- 15. 08 %). The EWH index was higher among RCHE population compared with community-dwelling population across different age groups and sex (paired t-test one-tailed P =. 014). Conclusion: The institutional elderly population was more vulnerable {{to the risk of}} excess hospitalization in winter. There may be room for improvement in the living environment of institutions, in particular the ambient temperature and personal care, to reduce hospital admissions.

40|$|Objectives: To {{introduce}} a health-related {{quality of life}} measure for home care and institutional long-term care settings based on the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI 2). Methods: Health attributes of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) were identified, and suitable constructs were determined. Items from the MDS were mapped to the HUI 2. Scores for the Minimum Data Set Health Status Index (MDS-HSI) were calculated using the HUI 2 scoring function. Measurement properties are examined and reported. HRQOL scores were compared across study populations and to an external reference population. Random samples were drawn from long-term care clients in private households (n = 377), supportive housing apartments (n = 80), two residential care facilities (n = 166), and a chronic care hospital (n = 274) in Ontario, Canada. All sampled residents were assessed for health-related items using the MDS. Results: The MDS-HSI results provide preliminary evidence of good validity. <b>Institutional</b> <b>populations</b> had lower overall HRQOL scores than community populations.

In this ex-post-facto study, the researcher examined the student entry characteristics of 2, 523 Hispanic entering freshmen enrolled anytime between Fall 2000 and Fall 2005 who attempted History, English Composition, or College Algebra {{for the first time}} in either face-to-face or distance education courses at South Texas College. The following student entry characteristics of the Hispanic students in the study population were examined for their impact on successful course completion and retention: age, country of elementary education, custody of minors, disabilities, English as a second language, gender, high school diploma type, high school GPA, hours of employment, income level indicators, intent to continue employment, intent to transfer, intended length of enrollment, marital status, number of credit hours, parents? education, participation in workforce programs in high school, reason for attending, recent migrant work, resident status, and veteran status. The resulting profile of Hispanic distance education student characteristics was found to be similar to common characteristics noted in the literature for other distance education non-Hispanic populations. Furthermore, the researcher identified significant student entry characteristics for predicting the risk of failing to successfully complete courses or to re-enroll. Finally, the researcher provided suggestions for further research regarding Hispanic student performance and success in higher education as a responsibility of the work of Hispanic human resource development within community colleges. This study provides empirical findings related to the student entry characteristics construct found in current theoretical models of retention in commuter institutions of higher education. The researcher recommends expanding this research to other elements of theoretical models of student departure such as the external environment and the internal campus environment.

The log-rank statistics, Cox’s proportional hazards model, the Nagelkerke R 2 index and a Harrell’s C statistic were used. Results: Univariate and three-step multivariate analyses identified that LNR was a significant prognostic factor and LNR classification was superior to both the pN and LODDS classifications. Moreover, the results of the Nagelkerke R 2 index (0. 130) and a Harrell’s C statistic (0. 707) of LNR showed that LNR and LODDS classifications were similar and LNR was a little better than the other two classifications. Furthermore, for patients in each LNR classification, prognosis was homologous between those in different pN or LODDS classifications. However, for patients in pN 1 a, pN 1 b, LODDS 2 and LODDS 3 classifications, significant differences in survival were observed among patients in different LNR classifications. Conclusions: For patients with colorectal cancer, the LNR classification is more suitable than pN and LODDS classification...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} staff behaviour {{and its relationship}} to problem behaviour in a group of 17 adults with developmental disabilities who moved from a provincial institution to community group homes. Data were collected in both settings on resident and staff behaviours. Results indicated that staff:resident ratios were higher in the community settings than in the institutional setting. Consequently, community staff were able to provide more individualized attention to each resident. Staff in both settings {{were much more likely to}} attend to residents when they were displaying problem behaviours then appropriate behaviours. Levels of resident problem behaviour did not differ significantly between the two settings and were higher in both settings when staff were absent from the room compared to when they were present. Staff reported increased opportunities for social and leisure activities when residents were living in community settings. The findings of this study suggest that movement into community settings is not sufficient by itself to improve residents ' behavioural functioning and that staff variables are an important factor in their adjustment. In recent years, the movement to return individuals with developmental disabilities from institutional to community settings has progressed at a rapid rate.

[28 - 01 - 2010]Objective: To {{study the}} prevalence {{and distribution of}} visual impairment and eye diseases by age and gender in an urban institutionalized population. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Four hundred three residents of nursing homes and hostels. Methods: Fourteen nursing homes {{were randomly selected from}} 104 nursing homes and hostels located within a 5 -km radius of each of nine clusters studied in the Visual Impairment Project (VIP) urban cohort. Participants completed a standardized orthoptic and dilated ophthalmic examination, including measurement of visual acuity and visual fields. The major cause of vision loss was identified for participants with visual impairment. Main outcome measures: Presenting visual acuity and ophthalmic diagnoses. Results: The participants’ mean age was 82 years (standard deviation, 9. 24), with an age range of 46 years to 101 years. Women outnumbered men by 318 to 85. Seventy-one (22 %) of 318 women had bilateral profound visual impairment (blindness), defined as best-corrected visual acuity < 3 / 60 and/or visual field constriction < 5 ° compared with 10 (12 %) of 85 men. However, this difference is not significant when age-standardized. Age related macular degeneration was the principal diagnosis of vision loss in the better eye of 74 (44 %) of the 167 participants with bilateral low vision (< 6 / 18 and/or visual field constriction to < 20 ° radius). The age-adjusted rate of blindness or profound visual impairment in the VIP institutional cohort of 5. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 8, 8. 6) was significantly greater than in the VIP urban and rural cohorts of 0. 13 % (95 % CI, 0, 0. 25) and 0. 29 % (95 % CI, 0, 0, 57), respectively.
