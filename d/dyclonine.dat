40|$|The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. Inherited {{deficiency}} in the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN) causes the rare disease Friedreich's ataxia (FA), {{for which there}} is no successful treatment. We identified a redox {{deficiency in}} FA cells and used this to model the disease. We screened a 1600 -compound library to identify existing drugs, which could be of therapeutic benefit. We identified the topical anesthetic <b>dyclonine</b> as protective. <b>Dyclonine</b> increased FXN transcript and FXN protein dose-dependently in FA cells and brains of animal models. <b>Dyclonine</b> also rescued FXN-dependent enzyme deficiencies in the iron-sulfur enzymes, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase. <b>Dyclonine</b> induces the Nrf 2 [nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2] transcription factor, which we show binds an upstream response element in the FXN locus. Additionally, <b>dyclonine</b> also inhibited the activity of histone methyltransferase G 9 a, known to methylate histone H 3 K 9 to silence FA chromatin. Chronic dosing in a FA mouse model prevented a performance decline in balance beam studies. A human clinical proof-of-concept study was completed in eight FA patients dosed twice daily using a 1 % <b>dyclonine</b> rinse for 1 week. Six of the eight patients showed an increase in buccal cell FXN levels, and fold induction was significantly correlated with disease severity. <b>Dyclonine</b> represents a novel therapeutic strategy that can potentially be repurposed for the treatment of FA...|$|E
40|$|A new {{agent for}} topical {{genitourinary}} tract anaesthesia, Epirocain <b>Dyclonine,</b> is reported are being an improved drug for this purpose, both as to {{margin of safety}} in use and clinical effectiveness. Thirty on e cases are reported in clinical study using jelly and solution of Epirocain <b>Dyclonine.</b> Exellent results (or no pain) were found in 19 of 24 cases (78 per cent) with the Epirocain <b>Dyclonine</b> Jelly, and in 5 of 7 cases (70 per cent) using the solution of this drug. We were noted no instances of side effects or reactions of any kind. The above mentioned findings suggested that Epirocain <b>Dyclonine</b> {{is one of the}} best drug for topical anaesthesia in its effectiveness and safety...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with UV detector for {{the determination of}} <b>dyclonine</b> hydrochloride and a gas chromatography (GC) method with flame ionization detector (FID) for the determination of camphor and menthol in lotion were developed. The developed HPLC method involved using a SinoChoom ODS-BP C 18 reversed-phase column (5 [*]μm, 4. 6 [*]mm × 200 [*]mm) and mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile[*]:[*]water[*]:[*]triethylamine in a ratio of 45 [*]:[*] 55 [*]:[*] 1. 0; pH was adjusted to 3. 5 with glacial acetic acid. The developed GC method for determination of camphor and menthol involved using an Agilent 19091 J- 413 capillary chromatographic column (30 [*]m × 320 [*]μm × 0. 25 [*]μm). The two methods were validated according to official compendia guidelines. The calibration of <b>dyclonine</b> hydrochloride for HPLC method was linear over the range of 20 – 200 [*]μg/mL. The retention time was found at 6. 0 [*]min for <b>dyclonine</b> hydrochloride. The calibration of camphor and menthol of GC method was linear over the range of 10 – 2000 [*]μg/mL. The retention time was found at 2. 9 [*]min for camphor and 3. 05 [*]min for menthol. The proposed HPLC and GC methods were proved to be suitable for the determination of <b>dyclonine</b> hydrochloride, camphor, and menthol in lotion...|$|E
40|$|Aliphatic amines (AAs) and {{carboxylic}} acids (CAs) {{constitute the}} two most commonly occurring chemical groups among orally active drugs [Manallack, et al., ChemMedChem, 2013, 8, 242]. Here, we aim to rationalize this observation in terms of molecular properties that are essential for drug bioavailability. To this end, the permeation of the AA drug <b>dyclonine</b> and the CA drug 4 -phenylbutyrate through a lipid bilayer is studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Permeability coefficients for the neutral and ionized forms of these drugs are calculated using the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model. To draw conclusions about other AA and CA drugs, the permeability coefficient is expressed as a sum over contributions from drug insertion into, translocation across, and dissociation from the lipid bilayer. Simple but general expressions {{for each of these}} separate steps are obtained and validated against the MD simulations of <b>dyclonine</b> and phenylbutyrate. We conclude that the neutral forms of most AA and CA drugs have large permeability coefficients (> 1 cm s− 1), while their ionized forms ensure solubility in aqueous environments. Thus, a physicochemical rationale for the reported abundance of AAs and CAs among drugs is provided...|$|E
40|$|Ascertaining {{the impact}} of uncharacterized perturba-tions on the cell is a {{fundamental}} problem in biology. Here, we describe how a single assay {{can be used to}} monitor hundreds of different cellular functions simul-taneously. We constructed a reference database or “compendium ” of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae, and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimen-tally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug <b>dyclonine...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a genome-wide protocol in yeast that allows the identification of those gene products that functionally interact with small molecules and result in the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Here we present results from screening 10 diverse compounds in 80 genome-wide experiments against the complete collection of heterozygous yeast deletion strains. These compounds include anticancer and antifungal agents, statins, alverine citrate, and <b>dyclonine.</b> In several cases, we identified previously known interactions; furthermore, in each case, our analysis revealed novel cellular interactions, even when {{the relationship between a}} compound and its cellular target had been well established. In addition, we identified a chemical core structure shared among three therapeutically distinct compounds that inhibit the ERG 24 heterozygous deletion strain, demonstrating that cells may respond similarly to compounds of related structure. The ability to identify on-and-off target effects in vivo is fundamental to understanding the cellular response to small-molecule perturbants...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of small Aβ 42 oligomers has been implicated as a toxic species in Alzheimer disease (AD). In strong {{support of this}} hypothesis we found that overexpression of Yap 1802, the yeast ortholog of the human AD risk factor, phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), reduced oligomerization of Aβ 42 fused to a reporter in yeast. Thus we used the Aβ 42 -reporter system to identify drugs that could be developed into therapies that prevent or arrest AD. From a screen of 1, 200 FDA approved drugs and drug-like small compounds we identified 7 drugs that reduce Aβ 42 oligomerization in yeast: 3 antipsychotics (bromperidol, haloperidol and azaperone), 2 anesthetics (pramoxine HCl and <b>dyclonine</b> HCl), tamoxifen citrate, and minocycline HCl. Also, all 7 drugs caused Aβ 42 to be less toxic to PC 12 cells and to relieve toxicity of another yeast AD model in which Aβ 42 aggregates targeted to the secretory pathway are toxic. Our results identify drugs that inhibit Aβ 42 oligomers from forming in yeast. It remains to be determined if these drugs inhibit Aβ 42 oligomerization in mammals and could be developed as a therapeutic treatment for AD...|$|E
