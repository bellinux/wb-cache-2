5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. The snail serves as first <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} this small snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. This small snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% {{infected}} in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5000|$|First <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> are {{molluscs}} of Prosobranchia, second <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> are fishes. Parasites of birds, mammals, and human.|$|R
50|$|Definitive {{hosts of}} Spirometra include dogs, cats, birds, and wild carnivores, while humans are {{accidental}} <b>hosts.</b> First <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> include copepods and other fresh-water crustaceans, while second <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> include birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> {{are also the}} reservoirs of Spirometra. There are no vectors of Spirometra.|$|R
30|$|We {{divide the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> {{population}} into three subclasses: the susceptible population (S_ 2 (t)), the exposed population (E_ 2 (t)) and the infected population (I_ 2 (t)), and N_ 2 (t)=S_ 2 (t)+E_ 2 (t)+I_ 2 (t) {{is the total}} number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts.</b> The <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> are infected via the ingestion of eggs. Since eggs are released by the infected definitive hosts, we assume that the amount of eggs is proportional to the amount of infected definitive hosts. It follows from [14] that the parameters of the humans do not affect the dynamical behaviors of the echinococcosis model. Hence in the paper we only consider definitive <b>hosts</b> and <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> in our model.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>host.</b> The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceResearch on mites as <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> of the {{tapeworms}} of the Anoplocephalidae {{family was}} encouraged by Stunkard (1937), who discovered that mites are <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> and vectors for Moniezia expansa tapeworms. This discovery stimulated other researchers to look for other mite hosts. In his review written in 1993, Denegri gathered data available up to 1991 associated with mites acting as <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts.</b> We extended his list by adding information concerning Oribatida, which participate in the life-cycle of tapeworms of the Anoplocephalidae and Mesocestoididae families. We gathered the Oribatida species that {{were found to be}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> by Denegri after 1991 and those that were available but not found in his review. This {{may be due to the}} difficulty in obtaining certain articles at that time. We gathered data concerning factors that influence the distribution of oribatid mites, development of cysticercoids in their bodies, and factors that limit the Oribatida species as <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus cantonensis involves rats as the definitive host and slugs and snails as <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts.</b> Humans can become infected upon ingestion of intermediate or paratenic (passive carrier) hosts containing stage L 3 A. cantonensis larvae. Here, we report a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that provides a reliable, relative measure of parasite load in <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts.</b> Quantification of the levels of infection of <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> is critical for determining A. cantonensis intensity on the Island of Hawaii. The identification of high intensity infection ‘hotspots’ will allow for more effective targeted rat and slug control measures. qPCR appears more efficient and sensitive than microscopy and provides a new tool for quantification of larvae from <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts,</b> and potentially from other sources as well...|$|R

5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E
25|$|The {{life-cycle}} of {{a typical}} member of this genus involves two host species, a definitive host and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>host.</b> Often the definitive host is a predator and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is its prey. The parasite reproduces sexually in the gut of the definitive host, is passed with the feces and ingested by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host.</b> There it eventually enters muscle tissue. When the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is eaten by the definitive host, the cycle is completed. The definitive host usually does not show any symptoms of infection, but the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> does.|$|E
30|$|Like {{many other}} {{parasite}} infections, {{the course of}} Echinococcus infection is complex. The worm has a life cycle that requires definitive <b>hosts</b> and <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts.</b> Definitive hosts are normally carnivores such as dogs, while <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> are usually herbivores such as sheep and cattle. Humans function as accidental hosts, because they are usually a dead-end for the parasitic infection cycle.|$|R

50|$|Information on the {{presence}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts,</b> required for life cycle completion by many parasites, is also useful in determining the likelihood that a parasite may have infected a particular ancient society. One example is the identification of molluscan <b>intermediate</b> <b>hosts</b> of schistosomiasis in an Islamic archaeological context.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> the miracidium {{undergoes}} asexual reproduction for several weeks, which includes sporocyst formation, {{a few generations}} of rediae {{and the production of}} cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail host into water and are also free-swimming. The cercariae penetrate a second <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> or they remain in the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>host,</b> where they form metacercariae. Definitive hosts become infected by eating secondary hosts which are infected with metacercariae. Once the metacercariae have been eaten, they excyst in the intestine of the definitive host where the parasite then develops into an adult.|$|E
25|$|In outline gametogony and sporogony {{occur in}} the {{intestine}} of the definitive host while both schizogony which occurs in various tissues {{and the formation of}} sarcocysts (containing bradyzoites and metrocytes) occurs principally in the muscles of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host.</b> In some cases a single species may act as both the definitive and <b>intermediate</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E

25|$|The larva hatches in the <b>{{intermediate}}</b> <b>host</b> {{and breaks}} {{through the wall}} of the intestine. It then forms a cyst in the intermediate host's body. The larva is initially rounded in form, with four or six short legs, but moults several times to achieve the adult form. The pentastomid reaches the main host when the <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> is eaten by the main host, and crawls into the respiratory tract from the oesophagus.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} Tarebia granifera was {{believed}} to be an <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> for the Asian lungfluke Paragonimus westermani (Kerbert, 1878), but Michelson showed in 1992 that this was erroneous.|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis is {{the unique}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> of Schistosoma japonicum, which causes {{schistosomiasis}} endemic in the Far East, {{and especially in}} mainland China. Oncomelania hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera {{serves as}} the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> {{for a variety of}} trematodes in its native south east Asia. Amongst these are several species of the family Heterophyidae some of which have been {{reported}} as opportunistic infections in people, and another, Centrocestus formosanus (Nishigori, 1924), is an important gill parasite of fish. Tarebia granifera also serves as <b>intermediate</b> <b>host</b> for the philopthalmid eyefluke Philopthalmus gralli Mathis & Ledger, 1910 which has recently (2005) been reported affecting ostriches Struthio camelus on farms in Zimbabwe. The snail host implicated in this outbreak was Melanoides tuberculata but the rapid spread and high population densities achieved by Tarebia granifera, which appears to be replacing Melanoides tuberculata in South Africa, may exacerbate the problem in the future.|$|E
