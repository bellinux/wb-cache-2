25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of Acheulean tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with Acheulean tools at <b>Grotte</b> du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France. The presence of the shelters is inferred from large rocks at the sites, {{which may have been}} used to weigh down the bottoms of tent-like structures or serve as foundations for huts or windbreaks. These stones may have been naturally deposited. In any case, a flimsy wood or animal skin structure would leave few archaeological traces after so much time. Fire was seemingly being exploited by Homo ergaster, and would have been a necessity in colonising colder Eurasia from Africa. Conclusive evidence of mastery over it this early is, however, difficult to find.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{history of}} the Ratte originated with a 1941 strategic study of Soviet heavy tanks conducted by Krupp, the study also giving birth to the Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank. The study led to a suggestion from Krupp's director (<b>Grotte),</b> a special officer for submarine construction, who, on 23 June 1942, proposed to Hitler a 1,000-tonne tank which he named [...] "Landkreuzer". It was to be armed with naval artillery and armored with [...] of hardened steel, so heavy that only similar weapons could hope to damage it.|$|E

Submitted designs and drawings of the tank went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. The tank was planned to be 1000 metric tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII [...] "Maus", the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes).
