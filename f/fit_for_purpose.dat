5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose,</b> rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

25|$|The {{place is}} a good, intact and {{representative}} example {{of the work of}} architect, Dr Karl Langer, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of his work. Most notably, it: displays a hybrid of subtle Classical allusions and Modernist architectural devices including a forecourt and stylised colonnade front; features characteristic simplified forms, decoration and spatial arrangements and a restrained use of high-quality materials; is sited and its form is manipulated for optimum orientation for natural light and ventilation of the interior, and; is designed to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b> As the largest commission of his career, it is a rare illustration of Langer's principles applied on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|Credit scoring {{models are}} allowed {{to play a role}} in the {{estimation}} of the risk parameters as long as sufficient human judgment not captured by the model is taken into account to assign the final rating to a borrower. The bank must also satisfy the supervisor that the data used to build these models are representative of its exposures, and there is no distortion in the calculation of regulatory capital due to the use of these models. Banks must also have in place a system governing the use of these models and whether they are <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose</b> for ongoing use; such a system must consider the stability of the model as well as its ability to predict default accurately.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and {{have little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b> Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E

500|$|The study, {{which started}} in January 2011, began by {{assessing}} {{the condition of the}} line between Gaerwen and Llangefni. [...] The track, bridges, associated earthworks, and the station at Llangefni were examined by engineers in order to decide whether they were still <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose,</b> or would need to be updated. [...] With the alignment having succumbed to heavy encroachment from vegetation, an environmental report would have to be drawn up to limit the potential damage that could be caused to wildlife. [...] Mike Gallop, coordinating the project on behalf of Network Rail, warned that bringing back trains to the line would be [...] "tough".|$|E
500|$|The earth {{material}} {{used for}} the embankments was planned {{to come from the}} road foundation works, but rainfall meant it was no longer <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose</b> and had to be imported instead.

The sub-base consisted of burnt red shale with thickness dependent upon the ground conditions, followed by a layer of wet mix around [...] thick and topped with 2–3 inches (approximately [...] ) of tarmac lined with 0.5-1 inches (approximately [...] ) of asphalt. A total of 22 bridges were required in construction, and designers were given relative freedom in planning them. Chief engineer Drake proposed the bridges be painted different colours to enhance aesthetics and help alleviate driver boredom, contrary to conventional practice of using neutral colours; drivers subsequently reacted favourably to alternately coloured bridges.|$|E
500|$|Section 3 {{covers the}} [...] "merchantable quality" [...] of goods. With the {{exception}} of defects that are pointed out to the consumer, or which the consumer should easily {{have been able to}} see, sellers are expected to provide goods of [...] "merchantable quality". This is defined as [...] goods [...] "fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price (if relevant) and all the other circumstances". Unlike the 1893 Act, the goods must be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose</b> only if sold [...] "in the course of a business". Previously, those provisions did not extend to goods sold by an agent; under the new Act all implied terms were extended to sales by agents, unless {{it was clear that the}} goods were not being sold in the course of a business.|$|E

2500|$|Influenced by {{classical}} Greek {{and contemporary}} Modernist architecture, Langer developed a sophisticated hybrid of classical and modern design principles. With his civic designs, Langer explored {{the idea of}} the conjunction of landmark and landscape and his designs typically incorporated a harmonious setting for the architecture. Inspired by Queensland's flora, fauna and climate, his designs worked with the context in complementary ways and his work on climatic design in architecture has been called [...] "pioneering". Fundamental to his designs, he sited buildings and outdoor spaces for optimum orientation, ensured interiors had high levels of natural daylighting and ventilation, and incorporated gardens of Australian plants for the occupation and enjoyment of the users. His designs were typified by modern, highly functional spaces that were <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose,</b> yet, had a degree of flexibility of use. Langer set new standards for design in Queensland.|$|E
2500|$|University College's {{development}} {{in the early twentieth}} century has been described as [...] "slow and fitful" [...] and the interwar period saw virtually no new building projects, leaving large parts of the college housed in buildings which were not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b> Attempts were made to raise income. In 1923 Rudyard Kipling, then the Rector of the University of St Andrews, visited University College and asked the merchant princes and leading citizens of Dundee to give the college their money and support. Kipling implored those who had lost their sons in the Great War to consider giving a donation so that their names would live on. Staff of a high calibre continued to be employed by the University including Alexander Peacock and Margaret Fairlie, who in 1940 was appointed as Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and thus became the first woman to hold a professorial chair at a university in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true agreement to the contrary. In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard contractual provisions in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b> Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific type of contract in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of contractual freedom, that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E
