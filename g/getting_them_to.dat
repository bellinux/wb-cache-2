25|$|To {{accomplish}} this bloodless coup, the invading fleet came well stocked with flags {{of the previous}} regime, propaganda pamphlets, and Dutch émigrés, {{the most important of}} whom was the Hereditary Stadtholder himself. One of the Orangist officers who had left the Navy in 1795, Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, had on behalf of the Prince contacted two of his former colleagues, Theodorus Frederik van Capellen and Aegidius van Braam (who had re-enlisted in the Batavian navy), with the object of <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> organize a mutiny in the Helder squadron (where they each commanded a ship-of-the-line).

25|$|The Federals broke {{southwest}} {{past the}} Skinner house and Mount Zion Church. For his part, Forbes attempted to rally his men, <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reform {{a line in}} the woods southwest of the pike. In the woods the two forces collided in fierce close range fighting. The Federals drew their sabers but found them ineffective against the Rangers pistol fire. In the close quarter fighting, Forbes encountered Mosby and attempted to stab him with his saber. Ranger Thomas Richards jumped in front of the blade, taking it in the shoulder and saving his commander. Mosby emptied his pistol, shooting out Forbes' horse from under him throwing him to the ground. Forbes quickly surrendered and the Federal resistance finally gave way. The Federals broke pell-mell into retreat with the Rangers in pursuit for several miles.|$|E

Four years later, Vivier began selling Rayne brand shoes in his Rue François store in Paris. The company also stayed in tune with mainstream direction of fashion – Mary Quant shoes were first displayed in its flagship store. The company also retained {{a stake in the}} mass market, with an interest in both H.E. Randall and Lotus chainstores. By 1966, Rayne was showcasing what were known as 'Young Design quartet' – Jean Muir, Roger Nelson, Moya Bowler and Gerald McCann – capitalising on London's thirst for younger designers by <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> design fashionable shoes in a more affordable price bracket, with designs being sold in Harrods and some high-street shoe shops. Rayne also maintained a strong foothold in the couture end of shoe production – indeed his role as chair of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1960 meant his shoes were shown as part of the twice annual fashion events held by the society. He also enlisted designers such as Norman Hartnell to create shoes for Rayne.|$|E

25|$|In September 1826, Lovejoy {{graduated}} from Waterville College with first-class honors {{at the top}} of his class. During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the South or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West. Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he walked up and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> subscribe to the newspaper. Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed. Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching Hillsboro, Montgomery County, in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis.|$|E

These actions angered Ranariddh, who in a February 1997 letter to Ariston's president Chen Lip Keong, declared the agreements [...] null and void. Subsequently, Ariston claimed that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact FUNCINPEC officials, {{with a view to}} <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> jointly sign the agreements.

The surface fleet was to sail to the Firth of Forth and surrender to Beatty. They would then be led to Scapa Flow and interned, pending the outcome of the peace negotiations. Meurer asked for an extension to the deadline, aware that the sailors were still in a mutinous mood (which earlier led to the Wilhelmshaven mutiny), and that the officers might have difficulty in <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> obey orders. Meurer eventually signed the terms after midnight.|$|E
500|$|Responses to {{the story}} were ambivalent; some reviewers called it strong with good dialog; others said it was poor. GameRevolution and CGW called the dialog poor, sophomoric, and often overly-verbose; in {{particular}} CGW said some speeches became an [...] "agonizingly long filibuster" [...] that only served to delay the return of control to the player. [...] Other sources called {{it one of the}} richest, most engrossing stories to be found outside films and novels, and more original than most RPGs. Computer Games criticized the linear storyline, and said the few dialog choices available to the player had no real impact on the storytelling. CGW said the linear story prevented Redemption from being a true RPG because it lacked interaction with many characters, and the lack of player impact on the story made it seem as though they were not building characters but rather were <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the story milestones. According to PC Gamer, while the game's linearity was a negative, it kept the narrative tight and compelling.|$|E

She spoke about suicide, although the court heard that Ferguson did not regard her as a suicide risk. She was discharged in September 1983. He continued treating her as an outpatient with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug. She was re-admitted to St Andrew's in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a psychotic episode in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her. She was discharged just under four weeks later, and as an outpatient received a monthly injection of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that has a sedative effect. From that point, the twins lived {{all or most of}} the time with Colin in Kilburn.
