5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent <b>ketosis</b> is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether <b>ketosis</b> has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|When in the hospital, glucose {{levels are}} checked several times daily {{and the patient}} is {{monitored}} for signs of symptomatic <b>ketosis</b> (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.|$|E
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary <b>ketosis</b> is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good <b>ketosis</b> and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase <b>ketosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10â€“15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess <b>ketosis).</b> The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Halitosis (from {{vomiting}} or starvation-induced <b>ketosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Low-carbohydrate diets such as Atkins and Protein Power are {{relatively}} high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ketogenic (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause <b>ketosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet is a {{diet that}} causes <b>ketosis,</b> a state {{in which there is}} an increased amount of ketones in the body. It is becoming increasingly popular for treating intractable epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the danger}} of {{infection}} to humans, it is important to maintain the health of milk-producing cattle. Common ailments affecting dairy cows include infectious disease (e.g. mastitis, endometritis and digital dermatitis), metabolic disease (e.g. milk fever and <b>ketosis)</b> and injuries caused by their environment (e.g. hoof and hock lesions).|$|E
25|$|Although other {{cells can}} use other fuels (most {{prominently}} fatty acids), neurons depend on glucose {{as a source}} of energy, unless the person is in <b>ketosis.</b> They do not require insulin to absorb glucose, unlike muscle and adipose tissue, and they have very small internal stores of glycogen. Glycogen stored in liver cells (unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells) can be converted to glucose, and released into the blood, when glucose from digestion is low or absent, and the glycerol backbone in triglycerides {{can also be used to}} produce blood glucose.|$|E
25|$|The term MODY {{dates back}} to 1964, when {{diabetes}} mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to {{what we now call}} type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic <b>ketosis</b> or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the climate}} of the Arctic is ill-suited for {{agriculture}} and lacks forageable plant matter {{for much of the}} year, the traditional Inuit diet is lower in carbohydrates and higher in fat and animal protein compared to the global average. When carbohydrate intake is inadequate for total energy requirements, protein is broken down in the liver through gluconeogenesis and utilized as an energy source. Inuit studied in the 1970s were found to have abnormally large livers, presumably to assist in this process. Their urine volumes were also high, a result of additional urea which the body uses to purge waste products from gluconeogenesis. However, in multiple studies the traditional Inuit diet has not been shown to be a ketogenic diet. Not only have multiple researchers been unable to detect any evidence of <b>ketosis</b> resulting from the traditional Inuit Diet, but the ratios of fatty-acid to glucose were observed to be well below the generally accepted level of ketogenesis.|$|E
25|$|However acetyl-CoA can be {{converted}} to acetoacetate, which can decarboxylate to acetone (either spontaneously, or by acetoacetate decarboxylase). It can then be further metabolized to isopropanol which is excreted in breath/urine, or by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol). Acetol can {{be converted}} to propylene glycol. This converts to formate and acetate (the latter converting to glucose), or pyruvate (by two alternative enzymes), or propionaldehyde, or to L-lactaldehyde then L-lactate (the common lactate isomer). Another pathway turns acetol to methylglyoxal, then to pyruvate, or to D-lactaldehyde (via S-D-lactoyl-glutathione or otherwise) then D-lactate. D-lactate metabolism (to glucose) is slow or impaired in humans, so most of the D-lactate is excreted in the urine; thus D-lactate derived from acetone can contribute significantly to the metabolic acidosis associated with <b>ketosis</b> or isopropanol intoxication. L-Lactate can complete the net conversion of fatty acids into glucose. The first experiment to show conversion of acetone to glucose was carried out in 1951. This, and further experiments used carbon isotopic labelling. Up to 11% of the glucose can be derived from acetone during starvation in humans.|$|E
500|$|A {{short-lived}} {{increase in}} seizure frequency may occur during illness or if ketone levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or {{the child is}} losing weight. Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even [...] "sugar-free" [...] food can contain carbohydrates such as maltodextrin, sorbitol, starch and fructose. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate <b>ketosis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Conklin's fasting {{therapy was}} adopted by neurologists in {{mainstream}} practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the New York Medical Journal claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent endocrinologist H. Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the American Medical Association convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite only having studied the patients for a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. Charles Howland, the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John a gift of $5,000 to study [...] "the <b>ketosis</b> of starvation". As professor of paediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, John Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist Stanley Cobb and his assistant William G. Lennox.|$|E
500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate {{diet that}} in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces {{the body to}} burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if {{there is very little}} carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as <b>ketosis,</b> leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Almost half of children, and young people, with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. [...] The most common adverse effect is constipation, affecting about 30% of patientsâ€”this was due to fluid restriction, which was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
2500|$|Glucose vs. plasma glucose: Glucose {{levels in}} plasma (one of the {{components}} of blood) are generally 10%â€“15% higher than glucose measurements in whole blood (and even more after eating). This is important because home blood glucose meters measure the glucose in whole blood while most lab tests measure the glucose in plasma. [...] Currently, there are many meters on the market that give results as [...] "plasma equivalent," [...] even though they are measuring whole blood glucose. [...] The plasma equivalent is calculated from the whole blood glucose reading using an equation built into the glucose meter. This allows patients to easily compare their glucose measurements in a lab test and at home. [...] It is important for patients and their health care providers to know whether the meter gives its results as [...] "whole blood equivalent" [...] or [...] "plasma equivalent." [...] One model measures beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood to detect <b>ketosis</b> for measuring both unhealthy ketoacidosis and healthy nutritional <b>ketosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} three days, the body is still using energy from glucose. After that, the liver starts {{processing}} body fat, in a process called <b>ketosis.</b> After depleting fat, the body enters a [...] "starvation mode". At this point the body [...] "mines" [...] the muscles and vital organs for energy, and loss of bone marrow becomes life-threatening. There are examples of hunger strikers dying after 46 to 73 days of strike.|$|E
2500|$|Following a diet {{consisting}} of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate {{for several days}} will usually result in higher levels of blood ketone bodies than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content. This relatively high level of ketone bodies {{is commonly known as}} <b>ketosis</b> and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in type 1 diabetics known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies [...] along with high blood sugar, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liver}} {{oxaloacetate}} can be wholly or partially diverted into the gluconeogenic pathway during fasting, starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged strenuous exercise, and in uncontrolled {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus. Under these circumstances oxaloacetate is hydrogenated to malate which is then removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into glucose in the cytoplasm of the liver cells, from where it is released into the blood. In the liver, therefore, oxaloacetate is unavailable for condensation with acetyl-CoA when significant gluconeogenesis has been stimulated by low (or absent) insulin and high glucagon concentrations in the blood. Under these circumstances acetyl-CoA is diverted {{to the formation of}} acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and their spontaneous breakdown product, acetone, are frequently, but confusingly, known as ketone bodies (as they are not [...] "bodies" [...] at all, but water-soluble chemical substances). The ketone bodies are released by the liver into the blood. All cells with mitochondria can take ketone bodies up from the blood and reconvert them into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used as fuel in their citric acid cycles, as no other tissue can divert its oxaloacetate into the gluconeogenic pathway in the way that this can occur in the liver. Unlike free fatty acids, ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and are therefore available as fuel for the cells of the central nervous system, acting as a substitute for glucose, on which these cells normally survive. The occurrence of high levels of ketone bodies in the blood during starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged heavy exercise and uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus is known as <b>ketosis,</b> and, in its extreme form, in out-of-control type 1 diabetes mellitus, as ketoacidosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketosis</b> and {{ketoacidosis}} are similar, but ketoacidosis is {{an acute}} life-threatening state requiring prompt medical intervention while <b>ketosis</b> can be physiological. However, there are situations (such as treatment-resistant epilepsy) where <b>ketosis</b> can be rather beneficial to health.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{who follow}} a low-carbohydrate diet will also develop <b>ketosis.</b> This induced <b>ketosis</b> is {{sometimes}} called nutritional <b>ketosis,</b> but the level of ketone body concentrations are {{on the order of}} 0.5-5 mM whereas the pathological ketoacidosis is 15-25 mM.|$|E
5000|$|Longer-term <b>ketosis</b> {{may result}} from fasting or staying on a low-carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet), and {{deliberately}} induced <b>ketosis</b> serves as a medical intervention for various conditions, such as intractable epilepsy, and {{the various types of}} diabetes. In glycolysis, higher levels of insulin promote storage of body fat and block release of fat from adipose tissues, while in <b>ketosis,</b> fat reserves are readily released and consumed. For this reason, <b>ketosis</b> is sometimes referred to as the body's [...] "fat burning" [...] mode.|$|E
50|$|Most {{advocates of}} low-carbohydrate diets, {{such as the}} Atkins diet, argue that {{the human body is}} adapted to {{function}} primarily in <b>ketosis.</b> They argue that high insulin levels can cause many health problems, most significantly fat storage and weight gain. They argue that the purported dangers of <b>ketosis</b> are unsubstantiated (some of the arguments against <b>ketosis</b> result from confusion between <b>ketosis</b> and ketoacidosis, which is a mostly diabetic condition unrelated to dieting or low-carbohydrate intake). They also argue that fat in the diet contributes to heart disease only in the presence of high insulin levels and that if the diet is instead adjusted to induce <b>ketosis,</b> fat and cholesterol in the diet are beneficial. Most low-carb diet plans discourage consumption of trans fat.|$|E
50|$|PetrÃ©n {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} with {{diabetes}} prior {{to the days of}} readily available insulin. He noticed that adding meat to the diet of diabetic individuals sometimes exacerbated or induced <b>ketosis,</b> whereas a diet with a high fat content reduced <b>ketosis.</b> He demonstrated that if protein intake was limited, and the amount of fat in the diet was large enough, <b>ketosis</b> in diabetes could be eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|In dairy cattle, <b>ketosis</b> is {{a common}} ailment that usually occurs during the first weeks after giving birth to a calf. <b>Ketosis</b> is in these cases {{sometimes}} referred to as acetonemia. A study from 2011 revealed that whether <b>ketosis</b> is developed or not depends on the lipids a cow uses to create butterfat. Animals prone to <b>ketosis</b> mobilize fatty acids from adipose tissue, while robust animals create fatty acids from blood phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). Healthy animals can be recognized by high levels of milk glycerophosphocholine and low levels of milk phosphocholine. [...] Point of care diagnostic tests are available and are reasonably useful.|$|E
5000|$|The Atkins Diet {{involves}} the restriction of carbohydrates in ones diet causing the body's metabolism {{to switch from}} burning glucose as fuel to burning stored body fat, sending the body {{into a state of}} <b>ketosis</b> [...] <b>Ketosis</b> causes a person to get their energy from ketones, which also causes you to feel less hungry [...] Carbohydrate consumption must be <40 grams/day (= 2 slices of bread) for <b>ketosis</b> to occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of ketone bodies may {{vary depending on}} diet, exercise, degree of metabolic adaptation and genetic factors. <b>Ketosis</b> can be induced when a ketogenic diet is followed for more than 3 days. This induced <b>ketosis</b> is sometimes called nutritional <b>ketosis.</b> This table shows the concentrations typically seen under different conditionsNote that urine measurements may not reflect blood concentrations. Urine concentrations are lower with greater hydration, and after adaptation to a ketogenic diet the amount lost in the urine may drop while the metabolism remains ketotic. Most urine strips only measure acetoacetate, while when <b>ketosis</b> is more severe the predominant ketone body is Î²-hydroxybutyrate. Unlike glucose, ketones are excreted into urine at any blood level. Ketoacidosis is a metabolic derangement that cannot occur in a healthy individual who can produce insulin, {{and should not be}} confused with physiologic <b>ketosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ketosis</b> is a {{metabolic}} process whereby ketone bodies {{are used by}} the cell for energy (instead of using glucose). Cells often turn to <b>ketosis</b> {{as a source of}} energy when glucose levels are low; e.g. during starvation.|$|E
5000|$|Some clinicians regard {{eliminating}} carbohydrates as unhealthy and dangerous. [...] However, it is {{not necessary}} to eliminate carbohydrates from the diet completely to achieve <b>ketosis.</b> Other clinicians regard <b>ketosis</b> as a safe biochemical process that occurs during the fat-burning state. Ketogenesis can occur solely from the byproduct of fat degradation: acetyl-CoA. <b>Ketosis,</b> which is accompanied by gluconeogenesis (the creation of glucose de novo from pyruvate), is the specific state that concerns some clinicians. However, it is unlikely for a normally functioning person to reach life-threatening levels of <b>ketosis,</b> defined as serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (B-OHB) levels above 15 millimolar (mM) compared to ketogenic diets among non diabetics, which [...] "rarely run serum B-OHB levels above 3 mM." [...] This is avoided with proper basal secretion of pancreatic insulin. People who are unable to secrete basal insulin, such as type 1 diabetics and long-term type II diabetics, are liable to enter an unsafe level of <b>ketosis,</b> eventually resulting in a coma that requires emergency medical treatment. The anti-ketosis conclusions have been challenged by a number of doctors and advocates of low-carbohydrate diets, who dispute assertions that the body has a preference for glucose and that there are dangers associated with <b>ketosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ketotic {{hypoglycemia}} is {{a medical}} term used in two ways: (1) broadly, to refer to any circumstance in which low blood glucose is accompanied by <b>ketosis,</b> and (2) {{in a much more}} restrictive way to refer to recurrent episodes of hypoglycemic symptoms with <b>ketosis</b> and, often, vomiting, in young children. The first usage refers to a pair of metabolic states (hypoglycemia plus <b>ketosis)</b> that can have many causes, while the second usage refers to a specific [...] "disease" [...] called ketotic hypoglycemia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketosis</b> is {{deliberately}} induced {{by use of}} a ketogenic diet as a medical intervention in cases of intractable epilepsy. Other uses of low-carbohydrate diets remain controversial. Carbohydrate deprivation {{to the point of}} <b>ketosis</b> has been argued to have both negative and positive effects on health.|$|E
50|$|This view {{is still}} {{held by the}} {{majority}} of those in the medical and nutritional science communities. However, it is now widely recognized that periodic <b>ketosis</b> is normal, and that <b>ketosis</b> provides a number of benefits, including neuroprotection against diverse types of cellular injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} or absence of <b>ketosis</b> is therefore an important clue to the cause of hypoglycemia in an individual patient. Absence of <b>ketosis</b> ("nonketotic hypoglycemia") most often indicates excessive insulin as the cause of the hypoglycemia. Less commonly, it may indicate a fatty acid oxidation disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Acetoacetate has {{a highly}} {{characteristic}} smell, {{for the people}} who can detect this smell, which occurs in the breath and urine during <b>ketosis.</b> On the other hand, most people can smell acetone, whose [...] "sweet & fruity" [...] odor also characterizes the breath of persons in <b>ketosis</b> or, especially, ketoacidosis.|$|E
