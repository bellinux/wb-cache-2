5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E

Cinderpaw learns that she can swim, and when Leafpool catches them, she is impressed with Jaypaw.|$|E

The class was developed by Coach Fred Lanoue for the Naval School, which was located at Georgia Tech before and during World War II. He taught students <b>how</b> <b>to</b> float in water for {{extended periods of time}} with ankles and wrists bound, <b>how</b> (unbound) <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> 50 yards (46 m) underwater, and other water survival skills.

25|$|The Kick Start {{program is}} part of the sports program, meant for people to build the {{confidence}} to pursue sport activities in the wider community. It aims to help build the skills and knowledge to start practicing a sport, while addressing their physical and mental health, drug or alcohol use. Health or age related issues can create a barrier for sporting activities. Kick Start offers individualised, case management support, from learning about healthy diets to learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> or join the gym.|$|E
25|$|After arrival on shore, males {{fast for}} three months, and females fast {{for five weeks}} during mating and when nursing their pups. The {{gestation}} period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression {{is more common in}} crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own. An orphaned pup may try to find another female to suckle and some are adopted, at least on Año Nuevo Island. Pups nurse about four weeks and are weaned abruptly before being abandoned by their mother, who heads out to sea within a few days. Left alone, weaned pups will gather into groups and stay on shore for 12 more weeks. The pups learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> in the surf and eventually swim farther to forage. Thus, their first long journey at sea begins.|$|E

50|$|Divers are {{initially}} {{taught to}} fin with legs straight, without excess bending of the knee, the action {{coming from the}} hips; a leg action with much upper leg flexion with bent knees like riding a bicycle is inefficient and is a common fault with divers who have not learned properly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fin <b>swim.</b> This leg action feels easier because it is actually producing less thrust. Fins with differing characteristics (e.g. stiffness) may be preferred, depending on the application, and divers may have to learn a modified finning style to match.|$|R
25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always wanted to know more about the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim,</b> and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one who knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, {{he points to the}} fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

25|$|In 17BC, {{his brother}} Lucius was born. Immediately after, emperor Augustus adopted him and Lucius from their father by a {{symbolic}} sale, and named both Gaius and Lucius his heirs. Their adoptive father initiated them into administrative life {{when they were}} still young, {{and sent them to}} the provinces as consul elects. Augustus taught Gaius and Lucius <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read, <b>swim,</b> and the other elements of education, taking special pains to train them to imitate his own handwriting, mostly by himself. Shortly after their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth ever Ludi Saeculares ("Secular Games"). The adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace - the Pax Augusta.|$|R

500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to {{people like you and}} me", whereas [...] "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

He {{was one of the}} five {{children}} of Donald and Patricia Bissell; his siblings included his twin brother William, two sisters Susan and Barbara, and brother Donald. The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high diving board, even though he did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim.</b> He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, he tried to keep his lessons a secret, but word got out and he was ridiculed and bullied every single day {{for the rest of his}} school days. [...] "I was a skinny kid. They could have crushed me in an instant," [...] he stated.|$|E
500|$|The Persian fleet {{began to}} retreat towards Phalerum, but {{according}} to Herodotus, the Aeginetans ambushed them {{as they tried to}} leave the Straits. The remaining Persian ships limped back to the harbour of Phalerum and the shelter of the Persian army. The Athenian general Aristides then took a detachment of men across to Psyttaleia to slaughter the garrison that Xerxes had left there. The exact Persian casualties are not mentioned by Herodotus. However, he writes that the next year, the Persian fleet numbered 300 triremes. The number of losses then depends on the number of ships the Persian had to begin with; something in the range of 200–300 seems likely, based on the above estimates for the size of the Persian fleet. According to Herodotus, the Persians suffered many more casualties than the Greeks because most Persians did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim.</b> Xerxes, sitting on Mount Aigaleo on his throne, witnessed the carnage. Some ship-wrecked Phoenician captains tried to blame the Ionians for cowardice {{before the end of the}} battle. Xerxes, in a foul mood, and having just witnessed an Ionian ship capture an Aeginetan ship, had the Phoenicians beheaded for slandering [...] "more noble men". According to Diodorus, Xerxes [...] "put to death those Phoenicians who were chiefly responsible for beginning the flight, and threatened to visit upon the rest the punishment they deserved", causing the Phoenicians to sail to Asia when night fell.|$|E

2500|$|The {{north side}} of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about [...] long. The usually lush Boise River Valley was a welcome relief. The next {{crossing}} of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Indian boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river—they knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>swim,</b> unlike many pioneers.
