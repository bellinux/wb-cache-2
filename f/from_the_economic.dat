5|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> {{realities of}} the {{conversion}} to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E

5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E

25|$|Again in {{contrast}} to Athens, {{there was also a}} latent antisemitism among a segment of the Greek population, in particular among the refugees from Asia Minor. When these immigrants arrived en masse in Salonica, they were excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> system. Consequently, some of these outcasts watched the Jewish population with hostility. The Jewish people were more economically integrated and therefore better off, which the immigrants equated with the former Ottoman power.|$|E
25|$|The {{state capital}} of Chang'an (Daxing), while {{situated}} in a military-secured heartland of Guanzhong, was remote <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> centers {{to the east and}} south of the empire.

25|$|A {{number of}} states are less {{integrated}} into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an opt-out from a certain policy area.

Most states outside the Eurozone are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their own independent currencies.|$|E

25|$|Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites {{from having}} sexual {{intercourse}} with {{the wife of}} another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, {{and a woman who}} was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery. This concept of adultery stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.|$|E
25|$|British {{troops were}} well-trained, experienced, and had good morale, but {{suffered}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> and technological limitations imposed by post-war austerity. The 16th Independent Parachute Brigade Group, which {{was intended to}} be the main British strike force against Egypt, was heavily involved in the Cyprus Emergency, which led to a neglect of paratroop training in favour of counter-insurgency operations. The Royal Navy could project formidable power through the guns of its warships and aircraft flown from its carriers, but a shortage of landing craft proved to be a serious weakness.|$|E
25|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> devastation and {{military}} {{threat from the}} south, Bulgaria had other problems: in 1365 the Hungarian King Louis I invaded northwestern Bulgaria, seizing the important Vidin fortress and capturing the eldest living son of the tsar, Ivan Sratsimir. In his unsuccessful initial attempts to retake Vidin, Ivan Alexander even resorted to using Ottoman mercenaries. Eventually, {{in the summer of}} 1369, the Bulgarian Emperor restored his authority over the Vidin Province {{with the help of the}} Wallachian voivode Vladislav I, but that proved to be his last success.|$|E

25|$|According to the ACP, {{the canal}} expansion's impact on {{employment}} {{was first to}} be observed in jobs directly generated by its construction. Approximately 35,000–40,000 new jobs were created during {{the construction of the}} third set of locks, including 6,500–7,000 additional jobs that were directly related to the project during the peak years of construction. However, officials state that the most important impacts on employment will be medium and long term, and will come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> growth brought about by extra income generated by the expanded canal and the economic activities produced by the increase in canal cargo and vessel transits.|$|E
25|$|The United States is {{the world}} leader in Internet supply ecosystem, holding over 30% of global Internet {{revenues}} and more than 40% of global Internet net income. Its lead primarily stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> importance of and dependence the United States places on the Internet, since the Internet makes the United States' economic activity faster, cheaper, and more efficient. The Internet provides a large contribution to wealth: 61% of businesses who use the Internet in the United States saved $155.2 billion {{as a result of}} ICTs as more efficient means toward productivity. In 2009, the Internet generated $64 billion in consumer surplus in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Argentina enjoyed {{four years}} of rapid {{recovery}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> and social crisis of 2001-02, {{which was one of}} the most severe losses of income and downturns in living standards on record. Effective macroeconomic management, focused on the generation of primary fiscal surpluses, has helped to sustain this strong performance. Consequently, average real GDP increased by nearly 9% per year between 2003 and 2006, surpassing the maximum GDP reached in 1998. Poverty and unemployment have fallen substantially from their peaks during the economic crisis. Poverty has declined to about 31% from a high of over 57% in 2002, while unemployment fell to near 11% from 21% in 2003.|$|E
