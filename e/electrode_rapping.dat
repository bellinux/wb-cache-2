40|$|Accompanying {{the fast}} {{development}} of power, cement and iron/steel industries recently, China have produced huge quantity of precipitators and its insulators. Different kinds of material {{were used for}} insulators, such as common electrical porcelain, high strength electrical porcelain, quartz (silicon glass), high polymer and high alumina porcelain, etc. A lot of successful and non-successful experiences were encountered. Of course there have different suitable material and geometrical choices for different industrial processes, yet it seemed for the same process there may have some different material requirements between European type and American type precipitators mainly because of their different type of <b>electrode</b> <b>rapping.</b> This paper summarized the Chinese experiences and comparisons of material selection and insulator geometries for different processes and precipitators both technically and economically. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the exit}} of {{electrostatic}} precipitator, among the escaped particles there {{have not only}} neutralized particles, but also particles that remaining negative and positive charges. Sometimes positively charged particles can account for 30 %~ 50 % of the total particles escaped. They are formed probably from the reentrainment by corona <b>electrode</b> <b>rapping</b> or from back corona effects. In view of this phenomena, for strengthen the corona electrode capability of capturing positively charged particles; new types of corona electrodes were investigated. It has multi- function of corona discharge, reducing back corona, prevent reentrainment and collect the positively charged particles. Different types and geometries of corona electrodes were proposed; {{all of them were}} featured to add a channel shaped wind buffer, which has the same voltage with the corona wire and located between subsequent corona wires. These buffers can reduce gas flow scouring reentrainments, collect positively charged particles and restrain back corona by electrostatic shielding effect. Bench scale laboratory tests were made to explore their discharging characteristics, current density distributions, etc. Two- dimension flow mathematics model...|$|E
