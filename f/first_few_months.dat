5|$|This {{action was}} {{one of a series of}} skirmishes known as the Forage War that persisted in {{northern}} New Jersey through the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1777, and it demonstrated that militia companies were capable of putting up a significant fight.|$|E
5|$|Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Inglis (20 January 1877 – 6 November 1914; name {{occasionally}} {{given as}} Karl Hans Lody), was a reserve {{officer of the}} Imperial German Navy who spied in the United Kingdom in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester {{changed hands}} three times, only one musket shot was fired, so until {{the start of}} the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval walls were not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E

5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> {{the wing}} was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units {{who were in}} possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron {{a full complement of}} aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of life.|$|E

5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{he found the}} pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|In the division's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> on the line, Chinese forces {{conducted}} three raids in its sector. In retaliation, the 245th Tank Battalion sent nine {{tanks to}} raid Agok. Two companies of Chinese forces ambushed and devastated a patrol from the 179th Infantry {{a short time}} later. In the spring, the division launched Operation Counter, which {{was an effort to}} establish 11 patrol bases around Old Baldy Hill. The division then defended the hill against a series of Chinese assaults from the Chinese 38th Army.|$|E

These <b>first</b> <b>few</b> spring <b>months</b> that edge themselves {{out from under the}} snow-blanketed winter are what she has been longing for. Now is her opportunity to sport her new cottons and flaunt her new date dresses and slimming suits...|$|R

Daily passenger traffic reached 130,000 in 2014, well below the forecast of 240,000 daily passengers for 2008. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken the system by December 2012., followed by 400 million by December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Robson met Elsie Gray on a {{trip back}} to his parents' home in Langley Park. She was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the 2009 {{season the}} Mets and Phillies {{looked as though}} they would make this year into another close playoff race. By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries.

5|$|Western jackdaws become {{sexually mature}} {{in their second}} year. Genetic {{analysis}} of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation {{and there is little}} evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure. Some pairs do separate in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying {{for the first time}} and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.|$|E

5000|$|The offstage {{voice was}} {{originally}} played by Jennie Sullivan, Arthur Sullivan's cousin {{under the name}} J. Hervey.

Jessie Bond in her autobiography mentions her spoonerism [...] "The missus is having such a cow with the rabman", which comes from this piece.|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{after the}} election, Modi made trips {{to a number}} of {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E
5000|$|Released as a single, {{the song}} became a {{worldwide}} hit for the group, spending {{two weeks at}} {{number one on the}} U.S. Pop and U.S. R&B charts. and reaching number four on the UK Singles Chart in the middle of 1976. In the U.S., the song was the 400th #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart. It also became just the second single to earn platinum certification status, after the RIAA established the designation in 1976. (Johnnie Taylor's [...] "Disco Lady" [...] had been the <b>first</b> a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> earlier.) Billboard ranked it as the No. 6 song for 1976.|$|R
