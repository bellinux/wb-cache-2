40|$|Abstract — an <b>inrush</b> <b>current</b> is a {{transient}} current with high amplitude that may {{occurs when a}} transformer is energized under no load or lightly loaded conditions. The magnitude of <b>inrush</b> <b>current</b> may {{be as high as}} several times of transformer rated current. The magnitude of <b>inrush</b> <b>current</b> depends upon leakage reactance, source strength, impendence of winding, residual flux. <b>Inrush</b> <b>current</b> causes huge mechanical and thermal stress on transformer in addition to inadvertent operation of the protective relay systems. The conventional method like pre-insertion of resistor, point on wave is used to minimize the <b>inrush</b> <b>current.</b> <b>Inrush</b> <b>current</b> in transformer can be reduced by selecting appropriate switching angle with respect to the remnant flux.

50|$|<b>Inrush</b> <b>currents</b> into {{capacitive}} {{components are}} a key concern in power-up stress to components. When DC input power is applied to a capacitive load, the step response of the voltage input will cause the input capacitor to charge. The capacitor charging starts with an inrush current and ends with an exponential decay down to the steady state condition. When {{the magnitude of the}} inrush peak is very large compared to the maximum rating of the components, then component stress is to be expected. The current into a capacitor is known to be : the peak inrush current will depend upon the capacitance C and the rate of change of the voltage (dV/dT). The inrush current will increase as the capacitance value increases, and the inrush current will increase as the voltage of the power source increases. This second parameter is of primary concern in high voltage power distribution systems. By their nature, high voltage power sources will deliver high voltage into the distribution system. Capacitive loads will then be subject to high <b>inrush</b> <b>currents</b> upon power-up. The stress to the components must be understood and minimized.|$|E

It is wise not to allow unlimited <b>inrush</b> <b>currents</b> from high voltage power distribution system activation into capacitive loads: instead the inrush current should be controlled to avoid power-up stress to components.|$|E

50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} bus wires which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the bus wires from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair.

5000|$|When a {{transformer}} is first energized, a transient current up to 10 to 15 {{times larger than}} the rated transformer current can flow for several cycles. Toroidal transformers, using less copper for the same power handling, can have up to 60 times inrush to running current. Worst case inrush happens when the primary winding is connected at an instant around the zero-crossing of the primary voltage, (which for a pure inductance would be the current maximum in the AC cycle) and if the polarity of the voltage half cycle has the same polarity as the remanence in the iron core has. (The magnetic remanence was left high from a preceding half cycle). Unless the windings and core are sized to normally never exceed 50% of saturation, (and in an efficient transformer they never are, such a construction would be overly heavy and inefficient) then during such a start up the core will be saturated. This can also be expressed as the remnant magnetism in normal operation is nearly as high as the saturation magnetism at the [...] "knee" [...] of the hysteresis loop. Once the core saturates however, the winding inductance appears greatly reduced, and only the resistance of the primary side windings and the impedance of the power line are limiting the current. As saturation occurs for part half cycles only, harmonic rich waveforms can be generated, and can cause problems to other equipment. For large transformers with low winding resistance and high inductance, these <b>inrush</b> <b>currents</b> can last for several seconds until the transient has died away (decay time proportional to ~XL/R)and the regular AC equilibrium is established. To avoid magnetic inrush, only for transformers with an air gap in the core, the inductive load needs to be synchronously connected near a supply voltage peak, in contrast with the zero voltage switching which is desirable to minimize sharp edged current transients with resistive loads such as high power heaters. But for toroidal transformers only a premagnetising procedure before switching on allows to start those transformers without any inrush current peak. Inrush current can be divided in three categories:- ...|$|E
