25|$|On 21 June 2010, the Court of First Instance {{held that}} the {{requirement}} that, subject to a grace period of 56 days, an adult applicant for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance ("CSSA") must have resided in Hong Kong continuously {{for at least one}} year immediately before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is unconstitutional since it unjustifiably infringes the freedom to travel and the right to equality.

As a result, the Social Welfare Department announced it is shelving the one-year continuous residence requirement for new and repeat applications for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance.|$|E
