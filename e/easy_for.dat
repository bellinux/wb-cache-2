5|$|COBOL syntax {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this was}} {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance. COBOL was also intended to be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> programmers to learn and use, while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.|$|E

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI {{had not been able}} to achieve up to this point.|$|E

5|$|Fulfordgate {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} of York, {{away from the city}} centre. It was a large distance from York railway station, while the tram service to Fulford only had one track, and the loop system for tramcars passing each other further restricted the service. During the ground's existence, bus routes had not been fully developed and car ownership was not yet become common; it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the majority of supporters to reach.|$|E
5|$|Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to {{contribute}} poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, {{making him the}} only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. However, with World War I as a backdrop, the times were not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> avant-garde literary movements (Aldington, for example, {{spent much of the}} war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.|$|E
5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This {{helps explain why}} research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Most {{visually}} impaired {{people who are}} not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read large-print, which is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to read without such devices.

5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to get into character. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines. Twining {{found he could}} not compete with natural ice, but in Melbourne Harrison's plant came to dominate the market. Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> plant ice {{to compete with the}} natural product. Elsewhere, however, natural ice dominated the entire market.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's magnates viewed reform with {{suspicion}} and neighboring powers, {{content with the}} deterioration of the Commonwealth, abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders.

5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part of the picture for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, {{and believed that}} there was little reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> them to accept it.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme is {{a single}} stanza in trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes and {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> younger children to master. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 4439 and variations have been collected across Great Britain and North America.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised.
