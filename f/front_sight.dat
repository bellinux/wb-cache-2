5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the <b>front</b> <b>sight,</b> keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
25|$|The {{sighting}} arrangement {{resembles that}} {{used on the}} AKS-74U and consists of a rear flip-up sight permanently attached to the receiver top cover with two open square notches with 50 and 100 m elevation settings and a round post <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> taken from the AK series of rifles, common to many Russian small arms. The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> is contained in a protective hood {{with a hole in}} the top to insert an elevation adjustment tool, while the rear sight is shielded by two metal ears.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1894 is {{produced}} in several variants, {{as shown in the}} table below. All variants are made in lever action, include a black walnut, straight grip stock, and except for the 1894CL, include adjustable semi-buckhorn folding rear and ramp <b>front</b> <b>sights.</b> The Model 1894CL features marble adjustable, semi-buckhorn rear and marble carbine <b>front</b> <b>sights.</b>|$|R
50|$|A variant {{called the}} Gendarmerie {{features}} adjustable rear <b>sights</b> and larger <b>front</b> <b>sights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> {{are fully}} enclosed, {{compared}} to the AKM and AK-47 which are partially opened.|$|R
25|$|Carrying handle {{replaced}} with a Picatinny rail for scope mounting as a designated marksman rifle. Said {{to be for the}} use of Indonesian special forces. The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> has been removed and the barrel lengthened and accurized to improve accuracy.|$|E
25|$|It {{featured}} {{an adjustable}} rear sight. The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> is pinned in, and the rear {{is held in}} by a set screw. The P97 is used {{by a number of}} police departments in the United States and elsewhere. The P97 was discontinued in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Pistols {{with this}} option include the heavier Brigadier bruniton slide with front {{serrations}} and Elite designation, Inox finish (silver) stainless barrel, thin skeletonized hammer, and bevel {{of the magazine}} well. A flat hammer spring cap was standard {{as well as the}} decock only (G-Model) feature and dovetailed <b>front</b> <b>sight.</b> It was introduced in 1999 and replaced by the Elite II option in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The P9 is a roller-delayed pistol {{manufactured}} from a stamped steel {{main frame}} and a polymer trigger guard. The stamped steel slide contains machined internal parts including a polygonally rifled barrel. High-profile fixed sights are fitted with two red rectangles {{on the rear}} sight and a white stripe on the drift adjustable <b>front</b> blade <b>sight.</b> Vertical zeroing is accomplished by fitting <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> of a different height.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of round}} rear and <b>front</b> <b>sighting</b> {{elements}} for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, {{takes advantage of}} the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles (circles all having a common centre).|$|R
50|$|The Škorpion is {{equipped}} with open-type iron sights (mechanically adjustable forward post and flip rear sight with 75 and 150 m range notches) and a folding metal wire shoulder stock, which folds {{up and over the}} receiver and is locked on the <b>front</b> <b>sight’s</b> protection capture.|$|R
25|$|The chamber is hand cut using chamber reamers {{specially}} {{designed for the}} M118LR round. Smith Enterprise Inc. is the only civilian rifle builder who uses these reamers. The gas system is unitized and hardened via Melonite. The gas piston is hard chromed to tolerances to ensure a precision fit within the hardened gas cylinder. Unlike traditional M14 rifles, the <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> is mounted on the gas lock {{as opposed to the}} muzzle to allow use of a direct-connect sound suppressor that mounts to the Vortex Flash Hider.|$|E
25|$|The SS2 is {{an upgrade}} of the Pindad SS1, being a {{licensed}} {{version of the}} FN FNC. The SS2's flash suppressor is based on that of the Colt M16A2, {{and it has a}} reciprocating charging handle {{that can be used for}} forward assist, with the <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> being based on the AK rifles. The carrying handle and detachable rear sight is placed on top of Picatinny railings. Most of the SS2 rifle variants can have its carry handle removed in order to gain access to its picatinny railings to install various optics.|$|E
25|$|The Colt Bisley was {{introduced}} in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley Target Model is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for windage only. The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> is a removable blade, which fits into the slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.|$|E
5000|$|When Warner Arms Co. {{could no}} longer get the Schwarzlose Model 1908 pistols from Germany, they had [...]32 pocket pistols made in the United States in three variations. the <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> and the grips {{that there was a}} {{conscious}} effort to imitate the outline of the Schwarzlose.|$|R
50|$|For optimal aiming {{and comfort}} the shooter should focus the aiming {{eye on the}} <b>front</b> <b>sighting</b> element. To avoid eye fatigue and improve balance the non-aiming eye should be kept open. The non-aiming eye can be blocked from seeing distractions by {{mounting}} a semi-transparent occluder to the diopter.|$|R
50|$|The {{cocking handle}} {{is on the}} left side of the upper {{receiver}} incorporated with a dust cover. The <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> are fixed and rear sights have an adjustment knob for windage. The upper receiver has a Picatinny rail installed allowing telescopic and red dot sights to be used.|$|R
25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher {{operating}} pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{overhauled}} to improve accuracy and update the styling {{while at the}} same time reducing production costs. The standard Mini-14 was discontinued and the name became the family name for all Mini-14 type rifles. As of 2005, all Mini-14 type rifles are now based on the Ranch Rifle design, with integral scope bases, a non-folding ghost ring aperture rear sight and a winged <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> similar to that used on the Ruger Police Carbine. These upgraded rifles have serial numbers beginning with 580 and are sometimes referred to as 580 series Ranch Rifles. They have new iron sights and a modified gas system designed to reduce barrel vibration and are capable of shooting 2 inch groups at 100 yards or 2 minute of angle (MOA) accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Both guns {{have their}} own handles which are a mix between a pistol grip and a more usual shovel-handle type used in Maxim machine guns. Each handle has a trigger {{operated}} with a forefinger. Support bars protruded {{from the rear of}} the weapon that the gunner leaned on to bear the weapon on target. The weapon was used on a 135cm high cone mount M/31 which, while it worked, was heavy and cumbersome to move. The sight was typical ring sight of the era, with an oval-shaped <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> with two consentric rings while the rear sight was a small peg surrounded by a protective ring. In action the anti-aircraft machine gun had an intended crew of six: commander, gunner, two loaders and two ammunition handlers. Equipment included a transport case for the weapon, spare barrels, locks and springs, toolkit and a wooden transport case for ten spare belt boxes.|$|E
5000|$|Stoner 63/63A Fixed Machine Gun: Internally {{identical}} to the LMG configuration. Externally, the <b>front</b> <b>sights,</b> rear sights, foregrip and pistol grip are all removed. The trigger is activated remotely by a 24V solenoid. The FMG was designed for use with the Cadillac Gage Commando APC, but was never officially adopted.|$|R
50|$|Optional {{finishes}} include stainless steel, matte stainless steel, nickel-plated and blued. Barrel {{options include}} 2", 4", 6", 8", 10". Not all finishes or barrels {{are available for}} every model. All models have ported barrels, except for the 22H, 30C, 513, 528 and Ultralite. All models have fixed <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> and adjustable rear sights.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Tritium-illuminated night sights. Rear sight at notch [...] "1" [...] with <b>front</b> night <b>sight</b> flipped-up.|$|R
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the <b>front</b> <b>sight,</b> and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E
2500|$|Gas is tapped {{from the}} barrel as the bullet moves past a gas port located above the rifle's <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> base. The gas expands into the port {{and down a}} gas tube, located above the barrel that runs from the <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> base into the AR-15's upper receiver. Here, the gas tube {{protrudes}} into a [...] "gas key" [...] (bolt carrier key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the bolt carrier.|$|E
2500|$|SIG P210-5: The sports {{extended}} barrel version chambered in 9mm Luger and [...]30 Luger, {{with wood}} grips, an adjustable trigger, a 150mm extended barrel with a detachable <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> mount, adjustable target sights, and bead blasted finish.|$|E
50|$|The Gewehr 98 or model 98 (M98) rifle is a {{manually}} operated, magazine fed, controlled-feed bolt-action rifle, 1250 mm {{in length}} and 4.09 kg in weight. It has a 740 mm long rifled barrel and carries 5 rounds of ammunition in an internal magazine. The Gewehr 98 has two sling swivels, open <b>front</b> <b>sights,</b> and a curved tangent-type rear sight, known as the Lange Visier.|$|R
50|$|When first {{introduced}} by Smith & Wesson in 1935, {{it was known}} as the Registered Magnum. The model was essentially a custom-order revolver. Barrel lengths could be had in quarter-inch increments from 3.5 to 8.75 inches in length. In addition to the different lengths of barrels available, there were different grips, <b>front</b> <b>sights,</b> triggers, hammers, and finishes available. Each Registered Magnum came with a certificate of authenticity.|$|R
5000|$|Fiber optic: A growing trend, {{started on}} air rifles and muzzleloaders, {{is the use}} of short pieces of optical fiber for the dots, made {{in such a way that}} ambient light falling on the length of the fiber is {{concentrated}} at the tip, making the dots slightly brighter than the surroundings.This method is most commonly used in <b>front</b> <b>sights,</b> but many makers offer sights that use fiber optics on <b>front</b> and rear <b>sights.</b> Fiber optic sights can now be found on handguns, rifles, and shotguns, both as aftermarket accessories and a growing number of factory guns.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "Flattop Target Model" [...] {{was listed}} in Colt's catalogs from 1890 to 1898. Colt {{manufactured}} 914 of these revolvers with a frame that was flat {{on top and}} fitted with an adjustable leaf rear sight. The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> consisted of a base with an interchangeable blade.|$|E
2500|$|The M1895 was {{equipped}} with a ladder-type rear sight adjustable {{to a maximum of}} 2,000 yards, determined by actual firing at Winchester in March 1896. [...] Because of the relatively high velocity and flat trajectory of the 6mm Lee cartridge, authorities calibrated the sights at their lowest setting with a point-blank or dead aim range of 725 yards (663 m). [...] The latter was intended for use on targets at all ranges from point-blank to 700 yards. [...] The single battle setting was intended to discourage individual soldiers or marines from adjusting their sight elevation unless firing at mass targets at extreme ranges, in which case officers would give commands for ranges to be set in such situations. [...] Owing to the necessity of supplying the Navy with rifles as soon as practicable, no provision for drift (windage) was included in the rear sight. [...] The prominence of the <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> and its exposure to damage led to the adoption of a sheet metal <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> cover for the 10,000 rifles in the original order. [...] The <b>front</b> <b>sight</b> cover was browned (blued) to reduce glare. [...] Each rifle was tested at Winchester for accuracy by firing a group of three shots at 50 yards, any rifle not showing the desired accuracy was returned to the line for adjustment, which sometimes involved restocking the entire rifle.|$|E
2500|$|The 416 had a {{dramatically}} oversized bull barrel {{and a large}} wooden stock. [...] The heavy barrel design added {{a great deal of}} weight which compared unfavorably with larger rifles such as the military's various [...]30 caliber offerings. [...] It had adjustable peep sight apertures, a hooded <b>front</b> <b>sight,</b> and a small, removable magazine.|$|E
50|$|On both models the <b>front</b> post <b>sight</b> {{height is}} fixed {{and can be}} drifted for windage adjustments.|$|R
50|$|Dovetail mount {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{dovetail}} track running perpendicular to the bore, often used for smaller <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> posts and rear sights blades found on handguns and some rifles. This mounting method is meant as a semi-permanent friction fit mounting solution where a slot is milled, for instance in the slide of a pistol, and a sight with a corresponding dovetail is punched or drifted into that slot.|$|R
50|$|The Mini-SAF is very compact, at only 12 in long. It has a short 4.5 in barrel, no {{shoulder}} stock (although the left-side-folding tubular metal buttstock {{of the standard}} SAF can be attached), and a vertical foregrip. The Mini-SAF can use the standard 30-round magazines, but comes with special 20-round magazines for a smaller profile. All versions have post <b>front</b> <b>sights</b> with adjustable elevation, and aperture rear sights, adjustable for windage.|$|R
