50|$|A {{refractive}} index profile is the distribution of refractive indices of materials within an optical fiber. Some optical fiber has a step-index profile, in which the core has one uniformly-distributed index and the cladding has a lower uniformly-distributed index. Other optical fiber has a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile,</b> in which the {{refractive index}} varies gradually {{as a function of}} radial distance from the fiber center. Graded-index profiles include power-law index profiles and parabolic index profiles.|$|E
50|$|Multi-mode fibers are {{described}} by their core and cladding diameters. Thus, 62.5/125 µm multi-mode fiber has a core size of 62.5 micrometres (µm) and a cladding diameter of 125 µm. The transition between {{the core and}} cladding can be sharp, which is called a step-index profile, or a gradual transition, which is called a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile.</b> The two types have different dispersion characteristics and thus different effective propagation distance. Multi-mode fibers may be constructed with either graded or step-index profile.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of mode {{scrambler}}s: the [...] "Step-Graded-Step" [...] (S-G-S) and the [...] "step index with bends". The S-G-S mode scrambler {{is actually an}} assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a step-index profile, a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> and another step-index profile fiber. [...] Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested. Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use [...] "Step Index with Bends" [...] mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber {{through a series of}} small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness. The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.|$|E

Characteristics of particular types of fibers used in fiber-optic chemical sensors, namely polymer-clad silica /PCS/ fibers, sectorial fibers or fibers with special <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles</b> are discussed in the next parts of the paper...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approximate}} solution for wave propagation in graded-index media is developed whereby the exact wave propagation equation {{is replaced by}} any one of a sequence of higher-order (m, n) Pade approximant operators. The resulting formulations may be discretized by common numerical schemes and solvable by existing numerical techniques. The accuracy of this approximate calculation of the wave propagator is demonstrated {{in comparison with the}} exact result. We then employ the resulting method to investigate wave propagation in metamaterials with <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles</b> which change according to a hyperbolic tangent function along the propagation direction...|$|R
40|$|This letter {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} microstrip lines that are printed on substrates composed of numerous dielectric layers using a fast technique that comprises the full-wave equivalent circuit and the discrete mode matching method. The validation of the proposed formulation has been done with a commercial package based on the finite-element method and very good agreement has been obtained. As a special application of our technique, we consider the analysis of microstrip lines printed on substrates with dielectric constants that vary according to given <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles.</b> The profiles are modelled by replacing the substrate by numerous homogeneous dielectric layers...|$|R
40|$|Achieving an ultra-broadband {{range is}} an {{essential}} development direction in terahertz techniques; however, a method to cover the full terahertz band by using a highly efficient antireflection (AR) coating that could greatly increase the efficiency of terahertz radiation is still lacking. It is known that structures possessing a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> can offer a broadband AR effect, and such structures have been widely used, especially in the visible range. In this paper, first, we tuned the refractive index of a cyclo-olefin polymer (COP) by using a TiO 2 dopant, and a polymer–TiO 2 composite with a refractive index of 3. 1 was achieved. We then fabricated a surface-relief structure with a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> by using a hot-embossing method. The structure on the silicon substrate can provide an excellent AR effect, but the working band is still limited by its scale of sag and swell. To obtain an ultra-broadband AR effect, we then proposed a flat six-layer structure; a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> was obtained by casting epoxy–TiO 2 composites {{in the order of}} a high index to lower indices. With a very well controlled refractive index and thickness of each layer, we achieved an AR effect of < 2 % in the ultra-broadband of 0. 2 – 20 THz...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient approach {{for the analysis}} of <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> waveguides. The variation of the index of refraction is modelled considering a sufficient number of concentric dielectric layers, each with a different index of refraction. The propagation constant in the layered structure is calculated by setting up a full-wave equivalent circuit, which allows the derivation of the system equation for the whole structure. Two examples are given, including validation with the commercial software Ansoft HFSS...|$|E
40|$|Light {{propagation}} is {{analyzed in}} thermally expanded core (TEC) fibers with <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile.</b> Used as power mixers among others, their core structure at {{the boundary between}} the heated and non-heated regions is represented by linear taper. Ray optics is used as the transverse taper dimensions are large relative to the wavelength of propagating light. Trajectories of meridian rays are derived analytically. Numerical results presented show ray trajectories as functions of the position within the taper and taper slope. These are modulated sinusoidal functions whose amplitude and period rise with the taper radius. Both, bound and leaky rays have been examined. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, the full-wave {{equivalent}} circuit and the discrete mode matching (DMM) method {{are applied to}} analyze dielectric waveguides and conformal striplines with circular and noncircular cross sections. To demonstrate the techniques, several applications will be shown. Optical fibers with different <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles</b> are analyzed first. In this case, the variation of the index of refraction is modelled using several homogeneous layers. The second application is the computation of the propagation constants for the two fundamental modes in elliptical dielectric waveguides. Finally, conformal striplines with noncircular top grounds are also analyzed. The comparison of our results with commercial software and with data from other authors shows good agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of graded-refractive-index (GRIN) antireflection (AR) coatings with wide-angle and broadband characteristics are demonstrated. The optimization of the <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles</b> with a genetic algorithm {{is used in}} the design of the GRIN AR coatings. The average reflectance over a wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm and angles of incidence from 0 degrees to 80 degrees could be reduced to only 0. 1 % by applying an optimized AR coating onto BK 7 glass. The optimization of step-graded GRIN AR coating is then further investigated in detail. A two-layer AR coating was deposited by electron beam evaporation with glancing angle deposition technology, and the positional homogeneity was improved by depositing the film from two opposite directions. The microstructure of the AR coating was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, and the residual reflectances of the coating sample are in agreement with theoretical calculations. The optimized GRIN AR coatings are beneficial to increasing the efficiency of light utilization...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of an optical pulse in a <b>graded-index</b> (parabolic <b>profile)</b> single-mode nonlinear optical fiber is treated {{by means of}} differential equation techniques. Using slowly varying envelope approximation and an averaging method over the transverse direction, a differential equation of the nonlinear Schrodinger type is obtained for the unknown envelope function of the electric field. The inverse scattering method is then applied, leading to the equivalent system of Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko coupled integral equations. A new iterative solution to these equations is presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the use of the {{relatively}} low index material SiON (n= 1. 56) for photonic crystal applications. With this system it is possible to enlarge the complete TE-band gap of a 2 D-photonic crystal by properly designing the unit cell filling. This may be practically realised because of the larger dimensions of photonic crystals in low index materials, which allows less stringent etch conditions when compared to traditional InP based materials. The optimal distribution of the refractive index is found by placing the displacement field in high or in low dielectric material. The structure is defined by two figures of merit, the width of the band gap and the smallest feature size, which is the key factor in etching the structure. In addition, we suggest the use of a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> to reduce out of plane scattering. This graded index profile can be realised by controlling the nitrogen flow during deposition of the SiON layer...|$|E
40|$|In {{a simple}} model of {{propagation}} of asymmetric Gaussian beams in nonlinear waveguides, {{described by a}} reduction to ordinary differential eqautions of generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equations (GNLSEs) with cubic-quintic (CQ) and saturable (SAT) nonlinearities and a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile,</b> the beam widths exhibit {{two different types of}} beating behavior, with transitions between them. We present an analytic model to explain these phenomena, which originate in a 1 : 1 resonance in a 2 degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. We show how small oscillations near a fixed point close to 1 : 1 resonance in such a system can be approximated using an integrable Hamiltonian and, ultimately, by a single first order differential equation. In particular, the beating transitions can be located from coincidences of roots of a pair of quadratic equations, with coefficients determined (in a highly complex manner) by the internal parameters and initial conditions of the original system. The results of the analytic model agree with numerics of the original system over large parameter ranges, and allow new predictions that can be verified directly. In the CQ case we identify a band of beam energies for which there is only a single beating transition (as opposed to 0 or 2) as the eccentricity is increased. In the SAT case we explain the sudden (dis) appearance of beating transitions for certain values of the other parameters as the grade-index is changed. Comment: 34 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{story of}} fiber optics has demonstrated {{the superiority of}} optical communications over competing technologies in long-haul data transmissions. Now, short-range high-capacity data interconnects are envisioned as the next field where optics and photonics technologies are likely to play a revolutionary role. In this contest, energy consumption per bit is the key number, and photon transmission is potentially much less power hungry than electronic transmission. This is the reason why, in a near future, massive data exchanges between and inside supercomputers {{are expected to be}} carried by photons. A part of this new story has already become reality. Board-to-board interconnects in supercomputers are already performed though multimode fiber links, providing high-bandwidth-density wirings with lower power consumption than that required by electric cables. But we can definitely do more; we can try to bring photons {{closer and closer to the}} brain of supercomputers. The new frontier is chip-to-chip optical interconnects, that is photonics links providing high-capacity and energy saving communications between electronic chips. Although this research field has been under the lens for several years, a winner photonic technology has not emerged yet. And the race is getting faster and faster. Silicon photonics is considered one of the most promising technology candidates, because it enables the integration of fast modulators, wide-band routing and switching architectures, and photodetectors onto the same chip. In other words, all we need for realizing end-to-end optical links on a chip. Yet, nothing is for free, and silicon photonics has still to solve challenging issues related to strong sensitivity to fabrication tolerances, and to temperature and environmental fluctuations. Another option is given by the use of multimode polymer waveguide arrays, which are drawing much attention because they offer high-density wirings with very low-propagation loss, low interchannel crosstalk, high bandwidth, and high coupling efficiency with multimode fiber, VCSELs and photo detectors (PDs). The main issue with this technology is the development of a simple, low-cost and reliable process to fabricate cm-scale long waveguide arrays with inter-waveguide pitches of a few tens of μm. A very original and surprisingly effective solution has been proposed by Kinoshita and co-workers, who have developed the so-called Mosquito method. In this technique, UV curable silicone resins are employed for fabricating the core and the cladding of polymer optical waveguides. The core resin is dispensed into the cladding resin, deposited in a liquid phase on a substrate from a needle mounted on a syringe, whose position is controlled by a horizontally scanning robot. After UV curing and baking of the core and cladding resins, a circularly-shaped core waveguide with a <b>graded-index</b> <b>profile</b> is magically obtained. This method allows the simplification of the fabrication of polymer optical waveguides, since photomasks, large-scale UV exposure apparatus, and chemical etching processes are no longer needed. Further, graded index core waveguides exhibit better performance than step-index waveguides in terms of loss and mutual optical crosstalk. By optimizing the fabrication process, waveguide arrays with a circular core of 50 μm and a pitch as small as 62. 5 -μm have been realized in this work, with an impressive control of waveguide size, spacing and circularity. The suitability of the Mosquito method for high-bandwidth-density on-board and board-to-board optical interconnects is confirmed by the demonstration of 12 x 11. 3 Gbps signal transmissions in an array of 12 waveguides without any signal deterioration. This successful result is a clear demonstration that technological processes must not be stuck in conventional schemes, because different ways of thinking are the primary key to the most significant advances. It is difficult to say at this point if the Mosquito method has the potential to compete with more consolidated photonic technologies, but it is always good to have alternative routes to follow. Let’s wait for more news from Kinoshita and co-workers...|$|E
40|$|Planar {{and channel}} optical waveguides {{fabricated}} by field-assisted $K sp+$-$Na sp+$ ion exchange in soda-lime glass are studied. An optical characterization of planar surface guides {{for a given}} set of fabrication conditions has been performed to determine the refractive index profile. Parallel to this, the ion-exchange diffusion process has been modelled numerically to predict the concentration profile of these waveguides. Direct measurements of the profiles using electron microprobe analysis has been carried out. The results of the characterization {{were used in the}} design and fabrication of a novel vertically integrated optical directional coupler. This device, composed of single-mode surface and buried ion-exchanged waveguides, allows for the optical fiber coupling to the buried guide and efficient power transfer to the surface guide, where the light can be detected by a modelled $GaAs$ photodetector. An improved version of the device using a sputtered $Al sb 2 O sb 3 $ surface guide allows for edge coupling to the detector. Calculations of the $GaAs$ absorption coefficient show an optimum behavior for a given thickness of $Al sb 2 O sb 3 $. An implicit finite-difference vector beam propagation method (FD-VBPM), that was improved to account for <b>graded-index</b> <b>profiles,</b> has been developed and used in the design of both directional-coupler structures. Finally, a three-dimensional FD-VBPM algorithm was implemented for the channel-guide version of the improved coupler...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Transmission {{fibers and}} erbium-doped fiber ampli-fiers (EDFAs) for 12 signal modes (including spatial and {{polarization}} degrees of freedom) are studied. Modal fields are computed numerically and their effective areas, group delays (GDs), and chromatic dispersion coefficients are determined. Multimode rate equations are solved numerically to calculate mode-dependent gains (MDGs) and pump power requirements in multimode EDFAs. Results are compared for various numerical apertures (NAs), index profiles, and doping <b>profiles.</b> <b>Graded-index</b> depressed-cladding fibers offer an attractive combination of low GD spread in transmission fibers (583 ps/km rms with 0. 15 NA) and low MDG in EDFAs (0. 14 dB rms at 25 -dB mode averaged gain with 0. 15 NA).
