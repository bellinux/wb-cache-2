25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, ships {{operated}} in the Helsinki–Stockholm service were small liners owned by Finland Steamship Company (FÅA), Rederi AB Svea and Steamship Company Bore. The ships {{used in the}} service were not built for navigating through thick sea ice, {{and as a result}} service had to be suspended during the winter months. Siljavarustamo, a <b>joint</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of the three companies mentioned before, had begun operating purpose-built car/passenger ferries from western Finland to Stockholm and other nearby ports in 1961, {{and by the end of}} the decade Siljavarustamo begun planning for ferries for the Helsinki–Stockholm service as well. Plans were to construct two ferries for a daily service, with high enough ice classification to allow year-round traffic on the route, and high enough speed to allow them to depart in the evening, with an arrival in the following morning (instead of the daytime departures of the ships used in the service at the time).|$|E
25|$|Mulroney {{took the}} job of {{executive}} vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, a <b>joint</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaler. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.|$|E
500|$|The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film {{historian}} Rachael Low, [...] "Many in {{the industry}} realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable." [...] On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (I Kiss Your Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a <b>joint</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.|$|E

2500|$|Following further {{refining}} of {{the plans}} to the ship by the shipyard, the keel of Project Finnjet was laid on 20 May 1975. In a traditional ceremony, coins were thrown onto the keel to wish the ship good luck. These coins were then welded on the keel. By 1975 {{it was clear that}} the growth predictions based on which the plans of Finnjet had been made had been overtly positive. At the time Finnlines and Finland Steamship Company were negotiating the formation of a <b>joint</b> <b>subsidiary</b> for their cargo-carrying operations. To ensure the success of Finnjet, Enso-Gutzeit and Finnlines were eager to induce Finland Steamship Company to withdraw from the Finland–Germany passenger services completely. This was successful, and as a part of the agreement of forming Finncarriers as a <b>joint</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of Finnlines and Finland Steamship Company the latter withdrew from the Finland–Germany passenger service, selling their Finlandia to Finnlines (in exchange for the ro-ro freighter [...] ).|$|E
