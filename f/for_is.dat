5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person they are looking <b>for</b> <b>is</b> showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen {{before it could be}} cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

The two agents later meet up with Nicholas Regali, a former mobster who claims {{he is looking for}} a job in the area. They later find out that Hayes's intuition about Regali was correct.

When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works <b>for,</b> <b>is</b> being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery.

5|$|In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed {{the castle}} to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the {{property}} continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks {{had been allowed}} to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested that fully renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that even if it were pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used <b>for</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.|$|E
