Į. Greitosios medicinos pagalbos (GMP) stoties ir privačios GMP stoties veikla. GMP paslaugų kokybės ir veiklos rodikliai gauti iš GMP kvietimo kortelių, duomenys apie diagnozių sutapimus ir ligonių stacionarizavimą gauti iš GMP siuntimų, o duomenys apie GMP finansinę veiklą Kauno rajone gauti iš finansinių įstaigų ataskaitų. Rezultatai. 2007 m. Kauno rajono tiek privati GMP, tiek valstybinė GMP iki 5 min. greitąją medicinos pagalbą suteikė dešimtadaliui ligonių, kai tuo tarpu pagalbą iki 15 min. reikšmingai didesnei daliai ligonių suteikė privati GMP, lyginant su valstybine GMP, atitinkamai 78, 2 proc. ir 43, 5 proc. Privačios GMP pervežtų į ligonines ir stacionarizuotų ligonių dalis buvo reikšmingai didesnė negu valstybinės GMP, atitinkamai 91, 9 proc. ir 54, 2 proc. Valstybinėje GMP dirbančių gydytojų nustatytų diagnozių nesutapimo procentas buvo reikšmingai didesnis negu privačios GMP dirbančių gydytojų, atitinkamai 6, 4 proc. ir 2, 8 proc. Valstybinė GMP vyko į ligonių pervežimus, nelaimingų atsitikimų vietas bei pas susirgusius asmenis namuose daug dažniau, lyginant su privačia GMP, tačiau pagal vienai GMP brigadai skirtus pervežimus bei pagal vienam etatui tenkančias suteiktas paslaugas privati GMP suteikė iš viso daugiau paslaugų ir vyko pas susirgusius pacientus į namus. Kilometražas, tenkantis vienai GMP paslaugai, taip pat buvo didesnis privačios GMP, lyginant su valstybine GMP teikiant visas paslaugas. Nustatyta, kad gydytojų ir kito GMP personalo, dirbančio valstybinėje GMP įstaigoje, atlyginimų vidurkis per mėnesį buvo reikšmingai didesnis negu dirbančiųjų privačioje GMP įstaigoje. Visos išlaidos 1 GMP paslaugai buvo mažesnės privačioje GMP įstaigoje, išskyrus ligonių pervežimus į kitas ligonines, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Bendros išlaidos, tenkančios vienam etatui, o taip pat tenkančios vienam kilometrui kelio iki ligonio, taip buvo mažesnės privačioje GMP įstaigoje, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Išvados. Greitosios medicinos pagalbos veiklos kokybės rodikliai bei pagalbos operatyvumas Kauno rajone buvo geresnis privačios GMP įstaigos, lyginant su valstybine GMP įstaiga. Aim of the study. To {{evaluate}} {{the activity of}} public and private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> stations in Kaunas district. Methods. The activities {{of public and private}} prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> stations in Kaunas district in 2007 were analyzed. Data on quality and activities indicators of prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was obtained from prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> invitation card, data about diagnosis coincidence and patients hospitalization was obtained from prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> committals, while data about prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> financial activities in Kaunas district was obtained from financial reports of the insitutions. Results. In Kaunas district in 2007, public as well as private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided first medical aid until 5 minutes for one tenth of patients, while until 15 minutes private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided first medical aid for significantly bigger proportion of patients, respectively 78. 2 % and 43. 5 %. The proportion of patients who were transported to the hospital and who were hospitalized was significantly bigger of private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> than that of public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> respectively 91. 9 % and 54. 2 %. The proportion of wrong diagnoses in the public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was significantly bigger than that in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> respectively 6. 4 % and 2. 8 %. The public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided patients transportation service, went to the places of accidents and to the ill patients at home more often comparing with private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> However, one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> team and one staff of private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> provided more services in general and more often provided services for ill patients at home, than that of public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> Mileage for one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> was bigger in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> while providing all services. Average monthly salary of physicians and other personnel of the public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was significantly higher than that of personnel working in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> All expenses for one prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> were smaller in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> except patient’s transportation to the other hospitals, comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> General expenses, calculated for one staff and for one kilometer till the patients, were smaller in the private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> Conclusions. Quality indicators and prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> activities were better of private prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> comparing with public prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> in Kaunas district...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the reasons for long stays in monitoring units and to propose a solution. Methods: The patients who were followed in monitoring units of <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> and the factors affecting the length of their hospital stay were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic features, their initial complaint that lead to monitoring, diagnosis, their means of arrival to <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> their admittance date and hour, medical history, basic vital signs, length of stay in <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> invasive interventions, intubation, mortality rates, consultations, and clinical results were evaluated. Results: The study included 603 patients. Average <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> stay in monitoring unit {{was found to be}} 6. 5 hours. In addition, 15 patients (2. 5 %) stayed 24 hours or longer, and 78 patients (12. 9 %) stayed 12 to 24 hours. Of the 15 patients who stayed in <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> for 24 hours or more, 8 (53. 3 %) stayed because there wasn't enough space in intensive care units. The most prevalent complaint for admission to the <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> was chest pain (25. 5 %), followed by dyspnea (21. 9 %) and tachycardia (11. 6 %). Conclusions: For real emergency conditions, monitoring units are necessary to follow patients closely and to perform immediate interventions. The fullness of the intensive care units primarily affects the <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> and leads to long stays in <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> as patients are waiting to be admitted to the intensive care unit. As the number of consultations increases, the monitoring period is prolonged...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} experiences and perceptions of some <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service and the New South Wales State <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service.</b> In particular in investigates their motivation for joining their organisation of choice, their affiliation, commitment and identity formation. There is very little research regarding the NSW State <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> volunteers {{but there is a}} growing body of knowledge regarding Rural Fire Service volunteers inAustralia. Significant research has been undertaken by McLennan and colleagues at La Trobe University and the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. The substantive findings of the research presented in this thesis about <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers’ affiliation, commitment and identity reveal many complex issues that require careful consideration. This research found that <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers are very strongly affiliated with their fellow unit or brigade members and with their local community. This affiliation is strengthened through the belief that the members of a brigade or unit constitute a ‘family unit’. Feelings of family, a sense of belonging to a team, camaraderie, friendships, being part of a group, trust and being one of the ‘locals’ are the emotive responses to the question about their affiliation with one another at the unit and brigade level. Close ties are also formed between the volunteers and their local community and this has a profound influence on the commitment of <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers. An <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteer’s commitment is largely parochial. It is influenced to a high degree by their identification to their primary group, their local community, the parent organisation and positive media reports. The sense of identity of individual <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers and of the collective primary group is formed and strengthened by the tendency to recruit like-minded people, by positive social opinion and by meaningful symbolism. A number of theoretical perspectives from the disciplines of sociology and psychology have been used to inform this research. The methods adopted included participant observation, document analysis including media reports, and semi-structured interviews. This research investigates a wide range of responses from <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers about their subjective world and the issues they feel strongly about. A thematic analysis is made from the responses to the questions posed. The importance of this research can be attributed to its contributions to several bodies of knowledge. In the broad sense it adds to the knowledge bases regarding the ‘work’ of the NSW SES and the NSW RFS <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers. More specifically, it adds {{to an understanding of the}} issues of <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers’ subjectivity and the fields of recruitment, motivation, commitment, affiliation and identity formation. A major contribution of this research is the detailed analysis of the complexities and subjective nature of <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteering. From a theoretical perspective, this research has contributed to the growing body theory on psychological contracts. It demonstrates that a range of psychological contract types is applicable to <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers and how they apply within specific contexts and situations. This knowledge provides a new insight into the complexities of psychological contract formation and, in the case of <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> volunteers, provides an insight into my construct of the different types of contracts they hold...|$|R
