5|$|A <b>different</b> <b>view</b> of the myth's end {{focuses on}} Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not {{reconciled}} with his rival, but utterly defeated, {{and sometimes he}} is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very <b>different</b> <b>view</b> of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the {{referendum}} was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's first box-office {{success was}} Arms and the Man (1894), a mock-Ruritanian comedy satirising {{conventions}} of love, military honour and class. The press found the play overlong, and accused Shaw of mediocrity, sneering at heroism and patriotism, heartless cleverness, and copying W.S.Gilbert's style. The public took a <b>different</b> <b>view,</b> {{and the management}} of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand. The play ran from April to July, toured the provinces and was staged in New York. Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr, with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894, much resented by Jenny Patterson.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{behavior}} of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two <b>different</b> <b>views</b> depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to Behavior of DEVS), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two <b>different</b> <b>views</b> as below.|$|R
30|$|Representative {{methods for}} multi-view {{learning}} {{can be categorized}} into three groups: co-training, multiple kernel learning, and subspace learning [52]. Generally, the co-training style algorithm is a classic approach for semi-supervised learning, which trains in alternation to maximize the mutual agreement on <b>different</b> <b>views.</b> Multiple kernel learning algorithms combine kernels that naturally correspond to <b>different</b> <b>views,</b> either linearly [53] or nonlinearly [54, 55] to improve learning performance. Subspace learning algorithms learn a latent subspace, from which multiple views are generated. Multiple kernel learning and subspace learning are generalized as co-regularization style algorithms [56], where the disagreement between the functions of <b>different</b> <b>views</b> is taken {{as a part of}} the objective function to be minimized. Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of <b>different</b> <b>views,</b> multi-view learning is more effective than single-view learning.|$|R

5|$|The upper {{portions}} of the Last Judgement panel are generally considered {{as the work of}} a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died. Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan takes a <b>different</b> <b>view.</b> She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or illuminator, perhaps from the workshop of the Bedford Master, travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{has always}} participated by itself {{in most of}} the major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. At the Olympic Games the International Olympic Committee charter only permit a Great Britain Olympic {{football}} team, representing the whole of the United Kingdom, to compete. Teams of amateur players represented Great Britain at the Olympics from 1900 until 1972, but the FA stopped entering a team after then because the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished. The successful bid by London for the 2012 Summer Olympics prompted the FA to explore how a team could be entered. The SFA responded by stating that it would not participate, as it feared that this would threaten the independent status of the Scotland national team. FIFA President Sepp Blatter denied this, but the SFA expressed concern that a future President could take a <b>different</b> <b>view.</b> An agreement was reached in May 2009 whereby the FA would be permitted to organise a team using only England-qualified players, but this was successfully challenged by the British Olympic Association. Only English and Welsh players were selected for the men's squad, but two Scottish players were selected for the women's team.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a <b>different</b> <b>view.</b> He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a <b>different</b> <b>view,</b> wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E
