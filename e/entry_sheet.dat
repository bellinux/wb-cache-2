40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{programs are}} an important tool {{for the conservation of}} endangered species. These programs are commonly managed using pedigrees containing information about the history of each individual's family, such as breeding pairs and parentage. However, there are some species that are kept in groups where it is hard to distinguish between particular individuals within the group, making it very difficult to record any information at an individual level. Currently, software and methods commonly used for registering and analyzing pedigrees to help manage populations at an individual level are not adequate for managing these group-living species. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} further develop these tools and methodologies for pedigree analysis to better manage group-living species. PMx is a program used for the management of ex situ populations in zoos and aquariums. We adapted the pedigree analysis method implemented in PMx to analyze pedigrees (records of descendant lineages) of group-living species. In addition, we developed a group pedigree data <b>entry</b> <b>sheet</b> and group 2 PMx, a converter program that enables group datasets to be imported into PMx. We show how pedigree analysis of a group-living species can be used for population management using the studbook of the endangered Texas blind cave salamander Eurycea rathbuni. Such analyses of the pedigree of groups can improve the management of group-living species in ex situ breeding programs. Firstly, it enables better management decisions based on more accurate genetic measures between groups, allowing for greater control of inbreeding. Secondly, it can improve the conditions in which group-living species are held by adapting husbandry practices to better reflect conditions of these species living in the wild. The use of the spreadsheet and group 2 PMx extends the application of PMx, allowing conservation managers and other institutions outside the zoo and aquarium community to easily import and analyze their pedigree data...|$|E

We reviewed the epidemiology {{of the relative}} uncommon forms of childhood brain tumors in a Chinese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a population based assessment based on prospective collection of childhood pediatric brain tumors data since 1999. Almost all pediatric oncology patients are admitted to 5 public hospitals in our locality. Standard data <b>entry</b> <b>sheet</b> was used and data entry was performed by full time data managers. It was crosschecked with the Hong Kong Cancer Registry which collected all local pathology reports of cancer. RESULTS: From Jan 1999 to Dec 2011 (13 yrs), a total of 415 cases of childhood brain tumors were diagnosed. Astrocytoma (including brainstem), PNET (including medulloblastoma), germ cell tumors, ependymoma all together account for 84 % (348 / 415) of all brain tumors cases. The rest of the tumors were divided into uncommon and rare groups. For the uncommon group, their respective incidence/million children (£ 15 yrs) /year were 0. 77 for craniopharyngioma; 0. 63 for the 3 tumors including atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT); choroid plexus tumors (CPT) and oligodendroglioma; and 0. 56 for ganglioglioma. Craniopharyngioma was commonly presented as headache, visual impairment or stunting growth. ATRT & CPT were mainly found in infant or young children and often presented with signs & symptoms of increase intracranial pressure.

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{basis for}} the design of a new process to form sheet metal into a flat, corrugated product is described. The underlying principle is to determine a surface between <b>entry</b> of the <b>sheet</b> into the device and the exit of the formed product such that all points across the width of the sheet under go as nearly as possible similar deformation histories and also that longitudinal strain in the sheet is minimized. The surface for forming a product having a sinusoidal profile and also that for a trapezoidal profile are presented as examples. For the sinusoidal product, an empirical equation is developed that relates the strain during forming with the initial and final width, the forming length and the number of profile segments. A physical model shows that a sheet can be formed to such a surface without straining or buckling. Although this paper does not describe the type of tooling or forming machine that would be used to plastically deform steel sheet, the authors believe such a device can be constructed. The results suggest that the new approach would reduce defects such as edge-wave, oil-canning and splitting and that the overall length of the forming device could be an order of magnitude smaller than that for existing roll-forming lines.

50|$|Around December 1932, Marian Rejewski of the Polish Cipher Bureau {{used the}} theory of {{permutations}} and flaws in the German military message procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French had a spy with access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French gave the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Poles were able {{to build their own}} Enigma machines, which were called Enigma doubles. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from Poznań University. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German's Enigma messages. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue breaking the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogs, built a cyclometer to help make a catalog with 100,000 <b>entries,</b> made Zygalski <b>sheets</b> and built the electro-mechanical cryptologic bomb to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six bomby, but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many bomby were needed, but the Poles did not have the resources.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} capital {{has been a}} much debated issue {{throughout}} economic, accounting and finance history. In economics it {{was defined as the}} financial resources utilised by companies while other definitions indicated it represented the actual capital goods themselves. This dualistic meaning of capital has led to various interpretations of the concept of capital and these different interpretations can also be found in the cost of capital model. The cost of capital model is a decision-useful financial tool employed by management to make decisions regarding the financing of projects, performance measurement and risk and return management. The two main forms of funding are debt and equity resources. The cost of capital model was built on the accounting interpretation and classification of the different debt and equity sources of funding. As time went by the financial markets became more sophisticated and new innovative instruments were introduced to help raise financing for companies. Some of these sophisticated instruments and accounting book entries are normally not included in discussion on capital structure and the cost of capital model. The aim of this research is to unbundle and understand the different dimensions of the cost of capital with special focus on the impact of accounting classification on hybrid financial instruments and certain accounting book <b>entries.</b> The balance <b>sheet</b> items that have revealed themselves as grey areas of the accounting classification and the hidden constituents of the cost of capital include accounting book entries such as deferred tax and accumulated depreciation, hybrid financial instruments and the effect of cash. Currently these instruments pose questions as to their proper debt-equity classification or can {{have an impact on the}} capital structure of an organisation. An adjusted model will be presented that will incorporate any hidden areas related to the debt-equity accounting classification schema. The introduction of these items into the cost of capital model will make it more robust and it will become an even more decision-useful tool for management and analysts a like.

40|$|Light scattering-based {{methods are}} used to {{characterize}} small particles suspended in water {{in a wide range}} of disciplines ranging from oceanography, through medicine, to industry. The scope and accuracy of these methods steadily increases with the progress in light scattering research. This book focuses on the theoretical and experimental foundations of the study and modeling of light scattering by particles in water and critically evaluates the key constraints of light scattering models. It begins with a brief review of the relevant theoretical fundamentals of the interaction of light with condensed matter, followed by an extended discussion of the basic optical properties of pure water and seawater and the physical principles that explain them. The book continues with a discussion of key optical features of the pure water/seawater and the most common components of natural waters. In order to clarify and put in focus some of the basic physical principles and most important features of the experimental data on light scattering by particles in water, the authors employ simple models. The book concludes with extensive critical reviews of the experimental constraints of light scattering models: results of measurements of light scattering and of the key properties of the particles: size distribution, refractive index (composition), structure, and shape. These reviews guide the reader through literature scattered among more than 210 scientific journals and periodicals which represent a wide range of disciplines. A special emphasis is put on the methods of measuring both light scattering and the relevant properties of the particles, because principles of these methods may affect interpretation and applicability of the results. The book includes extensive guides to literature on light scattering data and instrumentation design, as well as on the data for size distributions, refractive indices, and shapes typical of particles in natural waters. It also features a comprehensive index, numerous cross-references, and a reference list with over 1370 <b>entries.</b> An errata <b>sheet</b> for this work can be found at: [URL] *Extensive reference section provides handy compilations of knowledge on the designs of light scattering meters, sources of experimental data, and more *Worked exercises and examples throughou...|$|R
