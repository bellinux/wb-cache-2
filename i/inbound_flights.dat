5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> were performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway.

25|$|On 5 August 2013, an airlock in {{the main}} {{pipeline}} that delivers jet fuel to the airport caused all <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> {{to the airport to}} be diverted to other airfields.

25|$|All {{international}} <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> to London Heathrow Airport were cancelled {{on the day}} of {{the arrests}} except those already en route. Some flights to and from London Gatwick Airport were also suspended. Later on that evening, some flights had resumed, shorter flights were resumed around 6pm.

25|$|In the 2013 Los Angeles International Airport {{shooting}} of November 1, 2013, at around 9:31a.m. PDT, a lone gunman entered Terminal 3 {{and opened fire}} with a semi-automatic rifle, killing a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer and wounding three other people. The gunman was later apprehended and taken into custody. Until the situation was clarified and under control, a few terminals at the airport were evacuated, all <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> were diverted and all outbound flights were grounded until the airport began returning to normal operation at around 2:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|All {{flights in}} and out of Heathrow were halted for a short time after the accident. When {{operations}} resumed, many long-haul outbound flights were either delayed or cancelled, and all short-haul flights were cancelled {{for the rest of the}} day. Some <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> were delayed, and 24 flights were diverted to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. In an attempt to minimise further travel disruptions, Heathrow Airport received dispensation from the Department for Transport to operate some night flights. Even so, the following day (18 January) a total of 113 short-haul flights were cancelled due to crews and aircraft being out of position.|$|E

50|$|The {{required}} demolition notice was {{not given}} to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the owners of airplanes tied down at the field, {{and as a result}} sixteen planes were left stranded at an airport with no operating runway, and an <b>inbound</b> <b>flight</b> had to be diverted by Air Traffic Control, because of equipment scattered on the runway.

The runway was closed between 10:26 and 15:55 as a safety precaution following {{an emergency landing}}. Seven <b>inbound</b> <b>flights</b> and four outbound flights were cancelled, 17 flights were diverted to Tallinn Airport and Kaunas Airport and others were delayed.

50|$|Where permissible, some {{airlines}} have a disinclination to handle Special Service passengers, for instance {{by placing a}} higher age limit on unaccompanied minors than full-service carriers.

The cause of the accident was deemed to have been pilot error in landing well past the touchdown zone in poor visibility conditions at night. At the time runway 08 did not have ILS.

25|$|After {{an absence}} of regular charter services, Aspro Holidays {{operated}} a series of summer charter services during the 1992–93 summer season with its in-house airline Inter European Airways to Palma (Mallorca) and Larnaca (Cyprus) using the Boeing 737, and added a service to Heraklion (Crete), which was often operated using their larger Boeing 757 airliner. When Aspro Holidays {{was taken over by}} the Airtours Holiday group, the flights ceased. The early 1990s also saw weekly flights to Larnaca (Cyprus) by Cypriana Holidays, with Eurocypria operating the <b>inbound</b> <b>flight</b> via Norwich as a split load. The service continued for approximately two summer seasons before Cypriana Holidays went into administration.|$|R
50|$|On the <b>inbound</b> <b>flight</b> to Malaga the aircraft’s left {{engine fuel}} {{advisory}} light became illuminated, indicating a possible {{defect in the}} fuel shut-off valve. On landing, Jet2.com arranged for a spare valve to be fitted but the problem remained. It was not possible for the problem to be resolved before the airport shut for the evening. The following day engineers discovered a wiring defect in the fuel valve circuit which required repairing. As a result Jet2.com sent a specialist engineer and spare wiring from its hangar at Leeds Bradford airport. In the meantime Jet2.com decided to bring another aircraft from Glasgow to take passengers from Malaga to Manchester.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{conventions}} {{have been developed}} for defining flight numbers, although these vary widely from airline to airline. Eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned even numbers, while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers. Other airlines will use an odd number for an outbound flight and use the next even number for the reverse <b>inbound</b> <b>flight.</b> For destinations served by multiple flights per day, numbers tend to increase during the day. Hence, a flight from point A to point B might be flight 101 and the return flight from B to A would be 102, while the next pair of flights on the same route would usually be assigned codes 103 and 104.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn many Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, {{there is}} a need to predict events {{generated}} by objects. However, because of the dynamicity of IoT environments, it is difficult to predict with certainty if/when such events will occur. Probabilistic reasoning allows us to infer dependent probabilities of events, from other events that are either easier to detect or to predict. In this paper we propose an architecture that employs a Bayesian event prediction model that uses historical event data generated by the IoT cloud to calculate the probability of future events. We demonstrate the architecture by implementing a prototype system to predict outbound flight delay events, based on <b>inbound</b> <b>flight</b> delays, based on historical data collected from aviation statistics databases...|$|R

40|$|The fleet {{assignment}} model (FAM) for {{an airline}} assigns fleet types {{to a set}} of flight legs that satisfies a variety of constraints and minimizes the cost of the assignment. The through assignment model matches <b>inbound</b> <b>flight</b> legs into a city with the outbound flight legs at the same city that are flown by the same plane types and creates through connections (that is, flight connections with one stopover). The combined through and fleet assignment model (ctFAM) integrates both the models into a single model and obtains optimal fleet and through assignments by varying both sets of decision variables simultaneously. In a recent article, Ahuja et al. (2001) proposed a very large-scale neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithm for the ctFAM. In this article, we generalize this approach to incorporate time windows.
