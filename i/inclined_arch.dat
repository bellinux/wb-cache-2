40|$|Curved arch bridges with curved deck {{supported}} by an <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> either through web members or without are studied. Reference to shell-supported bridges is first made. It {{must be taken}} into account that even if the deck is {{supported by}} a shell, its bottom free edge (usually stiffened) is described by a thrust line, so that the shell connects the curved deck (that is a horizontal arch) with an inclined 3 D funicular arch. A limit case is that the ring girder of the curved deck and the funicular arch merge dividing the shell into two parts, so that, if shell thickness tends to zero, no shell connects them. This is the case of curved bridges supported only at mid-span by an <b>inclined</b> <b>arch.</b> The efficiency of different arches is compared. Moreover, the deck can be supported not only at mid-span but also by web members connecting deck girder and <b>inclined</b> <b>arch.</b> In this latter case, the most appropriate form of the <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> is obtained...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Incorporating the Lyapunov {{theory of}} motion {{stability}}, the elastic dynamic stability program of a leaning-type arch bridge with 120 m span is worked out via the modified freeing time method. The dynamic eigenvalue-time history curve and dynamic buckling modes are presented, {{and the effect}} of <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> rib on the dynamic stability of leaning-type arch bridge is analyzed and compared under the seismic exercitation in the longitudinal, transverse and vertical directions of the bridge. The results show that all of the dynamic buckling modes are out-plane instabilities when the effect of <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> rib is not considered, while dynamic stability coefficient increases by 6 %, 56 % and 166 % respectively when the effect of <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> rib is considered. ...|$|E

2500|$|These pair of bridges {{share the}} 45 degree <b>incline,</b> <b>arch</b> underneath, and the {{combination}} bridge/staircase design of their brother bridges. However, one noticeable difference is that this bridge is smaller. [...] The lower Lotus Flower Bridge has 10 steps while the upper Seven Treasures Bridge contains 8 steps. This bridge is on the west {{in relation to the}} Blue Cloud and White Cloud Bridges. The Lotus Flower Bridge is known for its delicate carvings of Lotus Flowers on each step but these have faded with the weight of many pilgrims. Today, visitors are restricted from walking on the bridge.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the construction of}} Palma del Río arch bridge, of 130 m span, recently constructed in surroundings of great landscape beauty {{in the south of}} Spain. A cable-stayed network was implemented, allowing a significant reduction in bending moments in deck and arch, which leads to structures of great slenderness and transparency. The two <b>inclined</b> <b>arches</b> are linked at the key, a very effective disposition to withstand out-of-plane buckling. The multiple crossings of the stays led to a complex geometric problem that has been solved satisfactorily with an innovative technical design of minimum visual impact.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} several remarkable bridges {{designed by}} Santiago Calatrava, a Spanish architect-engineer. In those bridges, Calatrava exploits {{the phenomenon of}} torsion of the deck to create a certain longitudinal asymmetry. This asymmetry enables the designer to include original features like a big balcony {{one side of the}} bridge, "to emphasize the position of the bridge in relationship to the city around it, or the direction of the water, or even the position of the sun. It permits to sensitize the bridge itself, as a phenomenon set into the surrounding landscape" (Conversation with Students, Calatrava). Actually an <b>inclined</b> <b>arch</b> stabilized by steel arms or hangers generates the sufficient torsion defying equilibrium rules. But those structures cannot be considered as classical arch structures. They cannot be classified as usual bridges: they are unique. This complex design is described through four relevant examples of bridges in which Calatrava gradually improved his technical design: the Lusitania Bridge, the La Devesa Footbridge, the Puerto Bridge and the Alameda Bridge. Lastly his most recent design, even more technically advanced than the previous ones, is analyzed with respect to its structural concept, its conceptual design and its exclusive construction process. by Florent Brunet.

5000|$|Construction of {{the bridge}} began in 2003. The bridge was {{opened to the public}} on September 5, 2005. It is named for the [...] "Apollo" [...] (modern successor: Slovnaft) oil {{refinery}} which was situated on the left river bank in this area before World War II. Its curved lines, <b>inclined</b> <b>arches</b> and virtual absence of right angles make the geometric shape {{of the bridge}} very sophisticated. In an unprecedented maneuver, the 5,240-ton steel structure, spanning 231 metres, was rotated across the river from its construction site on the left bank into its final position on a pillar 40 metres from the right bank. The Apollo Bridge was the only European project named one of five finalists for the 2006 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award (OPAL Award) by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to design the steel {{construction}} of a multifunctional building in the cadastral area of Brno-Bohunice. Multifunctional building consists of two identical buildings - A and B. Floor plan dimensions are 40. 0 x 40. 0 meters and height of 33, 8 meters. Both objects have the 1 st floor of the overall height of 5, 0 m, each additional floors 3, 5 m. The plan shape of the building is a square 40 x 40 m with bevel in the corners with a length of 8 m. In {{the middle of the}} building is roofed atrium 8 x 8 m. The buildings are in the 5 th floor connected with the enclosed footbridge with a length of 10. 0 meters. The main structure consists of two buildings columns and girders. Columns are alternatively solved as the composite steel and concrete structures with closed section filled with concrete or concreted steel profile. The girders are made of castellated beams. Among the girders are embedded solid panel joists and girders, coupled with the composite steel and concrete slab. Spatial rigidity besides the composite slabs provide rods placed around the atrium and in the corners of the building.

40|$|AbstractA new {{bridge was}} {{required}} {{in the city of}} Sibiu, to ensure the crossing of Cibin River, in Sibiu, in the Cibin square, {{due to the fact that}} the old bridge, with only two traffic lanes, was having both a weight and height restriction and was also strangling the traffic in the area. The streets connected by the bridge are all with four lanes. This paper presents aspects regarding the design and the erection of the new bridge. The new bridge, designed with four vehicle lanes and two lateral pedestrian and cyclist lanes, is an arch bridge with arches having a circular cross-section section Ø 508 x 40 mm. The main arches are connected to two secondary <b>inclined</b> <b>arches</b> in order to prevent their lateral buckling. The span of the arches is 34. 0 m and their rise 8. 1 m. The curvature of the arches was achieved by hot bending of the sections, through the electromagnetic induction phenomenon, at a factory from the field of extractive industry from another Romanian city, Ploiesti. The bridge deck is a composite structure consisting in cross girders and a reinforced slab. The slab loading is transmitted to the main arches through hangers made from solid circular steel bars of steel S 460 M. Some special issues that arisen during the design and execution of the bridge are addressed: prevention of the lateral buckling phenomenon and the adjustment of the execution of the steel deck to actual manufacturing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} software combining parametric {{geometric modeling}} with {{a version of}} the harmony search method, modified to support multimodal structural optimization. Researchers have recognized the potential of population-based optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, to support multimodal optimization: that is, generating a diverse range of good alternative solutions, rather than a single best solution. Among these methods is the harmony search method, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in many unimodal structural optimization problems. The paper describes {{a new version of the}} harmony search method, implemented as an assembly within Bentley's Generative Components, enabling high-level control of geometry. The new method is demonstrated on an bridge supported by two <b>inclined</b> parabolic <b>arches,</b> a structure where GC controls a complex geometry with a single variable. Comparative studies of the example find that the new method is more effective than conventional harmony search in consistently finding multiple good solutions...|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetric}} cable-stayed system {{consists of}} two A shape pylons, each inclined away from the main span at an angle of 78°, held by 10 pairs of back stays spread into two planes, and 22 main stay cables in one plane anchored on {{and pick up the}} middle spine of the main-span deck. The through-arch system, on the other hand, employs <b>inclined</b> hangers (from <b>arches)</b> anchored on and pick up the outer edges of the main-span deck. With support at the middle and the outer edges, the main-span bridge deck can be made relatively lightweight and slender.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} {{was completed in}} May 2001 {{at a cost of}} 265,000,000 USD. The roof was engineered by the international consultancy WS Atkins. The roof is in two sections, each with an <b>inclined</b> trussed steel <b>arch</b> spanning 273 m for a rise of only 28.7 m, and propped by 13 secondary arches off a perimeter second [...] "arch" [...] that is supported by raking columns. The total roof steel weight is 4,350 t. The roof cladding is a PTFE-coated glass-reinforced fabric canopy. The modelling (form-finding) and analysis of the tensile roof was performed by Tensys. Wind tunnel studies were carried out by BMT Limited to assess the wind loading on the roof.|$|R
50|$|For a {{specific}} construction method, especially for masonry arches, {{the proportions of}} the arch remain similar {{no matter what the}} size: wider arches are thus required to be taller arches. For a semi-circular arch, the height is half of the span. Bridges across deep, narrow gorges can have their arch placed entirely beneath a flat roadway, but bridges in flatter country rise above their road approaches. A wide bridge may require an arch so tall as to become a significant obstacle and incline for the roadway. Small bridges can be hump-backed, but larger bridges such as the Old Bridge, Pontypridd may become so steep as to require steps, making their use for wheeled traffic difficult. Railways also find arched bridges difficult as they are even less tolerant of <b>inclines.</b> Where simple <b>arched</b> bridges are used for railways on flat terrain the cost of building long approach embankments may be considerable.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Investigation and {{analysis}} of the hanger arrangement and the structural stability of a Network arch bridge – a tied-arch bridge with inclined hangers that cross each other at least twice. It is also necessary to make a comparative analysis with other types of hanger arrangements. Methodology. The authors in their research investigated a large number of parameters to determine their influence in the force distribution in the arch. Eventually they determined optimal values for all parameters. These optimal values allowed developing a design guide that leads to optimal arch design. When solving this problem, the authors used three-dimensional finite element models and the objective was to determine the most suitable solution for a road bridge, with a span of 100 meters, consisting of two <b>inclined</b> steel <b>arches,</b> located on a road with two traffic lanes, subjected to medium traffic. The virtual prototype of the model is performed by finite element simulator Midas Civil. Findings. In this study, for the bridge deck, a concrete tie appears to be the best solution considering the structural behavior of network arches, but economic advantages caused by easier erection may lead to steel or a composite bridge deck as better alternatives. Design requirements and local conditions of each particular bridge project will decide the most economic deck design. Originality. To ensure passenger comfort and the stability and continuity of the track, deformations of bridges are constricted. A network arch is a stiff structure with small deflections and therefore suitable to comply with such demands even for high speed railway traffic.  A network arch bridge with a concrete tie usually saves more than half the steel required for tied arches with vertical hangers and concrete ties. Practical value. Following the study design advice given in this article leads to savings of about 60 % of structural steel compared with conventional tied arch bridges with vertical hangers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistorical {{steel beam}} bridge over Gliwice Canal {{located in a}} small city close to the eclectic palace from 19 th century has been {{strengthened}} by suspension to new steel arches. The old structure was insufficient for fulfilling current demands of road traffic and clearance. Another issue was its localization {{in the vicinity of}} the palace and the lake, which are attractive recreational areas. Therefore, the new structure should be also ready for safe pedestrian and bicycle traffic. To fulfil those conditions and also to create a landmark bridge in this interesting spot, an arch structure was chosen. Designer decided to use the old bridge and its abutments as a part of the new structure. The deck was renovated and suspended to two <b>inclined</b> hingeless steel <b>arches.</b> To accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic, two external footbridges were also suspended to the same arches on both sides. Static and dynamic load tests of the bridge were conducted. An Operational Modal Analysis method was used to identify the dynamic model of the bridge. Due to a limited number of transducers and the simple procedure of the test, the compromise between effort and quality was established. Good correlation between assumptions from the design stage and the response of the erected bridge was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The Hybrid Composite Beam (HCB) {{system is}} an {{innovative}} structural technology {{that has been}} recently used in bridge construction within the U. S. transportation network. In this system, the superstructure consists of a conventional reinforced concrete deck supported by Hybrid Composite Beams. Each beam is comprised of a glass-fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) box shell containing a tied parabolic concrete <b>arch.</b> <b>Inclined</b> stirrups provide shear integrity and enforce composite action between the HCBs and the concrete deck. This paper focuses on evaluating the in-service performance of a newly constructed HCB bridge superstructure located on Route 205 in Colonial Beach, Virginia. A live load test was conducted using tandem axle dump trucks under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. Results obtained from the experimental investigation {{were used to determine}} three key behavior characteristics. Dynamic amplification and lateral load distribution were found to be reasonable in comparison to the assumed design values. The testing program also included internal and external measurement systems to help characterize the load sharing behavior of the HCB on an element level. The main load carrying elements are the deck in compression and the steel ties in tension, and the FRP shell did not act compositely with the internal components. 1...|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{was one in}} {{the very}} bud of young and active manhood. His years could not have exceeded two-and-twenty, nor would he probably have been thought so old, had not his features been shaded by a rich, brown hue, that in some degree, served as a foil to a natural complexion, which, though never fair, was still clear and blooming. A pair of dark, bushy, and jet-black, silken whiskers, that were in singular contrast to eye-lashes and brows of almost feminine beauty and softness, aided also in giving a decided expression to a face that might otherwise have been wanting in some of that character which is thought essential to comeliness in man. The forehead was smooth and low; the nose, though prominent and bold in outline, of exceeding delicacy in detail; the mouth and lips full, a little <b>inclined</b> to be <b>arch,</b> though the former appeared {{as if it might}} at times be pensive; the teeth were even and unsullied; and the chin was small, round, dimpled, and so carefully divested of the distinguishing mark of the sex, that one could fancy nature had contributed all its growth to adorn the neighboring cheeks and temples. If to these features be added a pair of full and brilliant coal-black eyes, that appeared to vary their expression at their master's will, the reader will at once see, that the privacy of Alida had been invaded by one whose personal attractions might, under other circumstances, have been dangerous to the imagination of a female, whose taste was in some degree influenced by a standard created by her own loveliness.|$|R
