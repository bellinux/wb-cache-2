50|$|Diplostomum pseudospathaceum {{is a type}} of fluke infecting {{the eyes}} of some species of fish, {{altering}} their movement patterns to suit its needs at different stages of development. The parasite infects snails and birds, sexually reproducing in the latter (its primary host) and asexually in the former (its first intermediate host), as well as many species of fish (its second intermediate host). When infecting a fish it quickly moved into the <b>fish's</b> <b>eye</b> <b>lenses,</b> as they lack blood circulation, so the parasite is protected there from the host's immune system. This latter trait is probably responsible for the parasite's broad range of fish host species.

Photoshop cannot produce them as quickly or accurately as stitching software programs can such as Autodesk Stitcher. This is because there is sophisticated math and camera-lens profiles that are needed to create the desired panorama image {{which is based on}} your camera's depth of field (FOV) and the type of lens used. Cameras such as the Nikon D3 or D700 have a full frame digital SLR cameras, whereas the Nikon D90 or Canon T2i (Rebel line of Digital EOS cameras) have a smaller sensor. When full frame digital SLR cameras are used with a <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> such as a Sigma 8mm F/3.5, a full circular image is captured. This allows you to shoot 2 or 3 shots per view to create a 360 X 360 stitched panoramic image. When used with a non full frame digital SLR camera like the Nikon D90 or Canon digital Rebel and similar cameras, 4-shots are required with the camera in the portrait position. The resulting image will have the left and right sides cropped off each of the 4 images and each of the four corners, creating a rounded image.|$|E

Initially, a simulation was performed to determine the mathematic calculations involved in transforming polarisation patterns into compass heading relative to the sun. Next, a simple inexpensive camera system was deployed to determine feasibility using ordinary cameras with polarisation filters. The final step involved taking this simple system {{and replacing it with}} a high-end camera system using <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> and mounting it on a fixed-wing model aircraft. This last step extended the work of previous researchers who had either only used filtered photodiode arrays on fixed-wing aircraft or filtered cameras on a non-pitching and non-rolling rotating wing aircraft (quad-copter). It was found that despite pitch and roll of the aircraft, a standard deviation of approximately 30 ° was achieved relative to true heading values obtained from the aircraft's flight computer.

40|$|The current {{landscape}} of nanotechnology has focussed attention on materials that self-assemble. The search for such materials has unsurprisingly {{led to the}} biological world, where functional nanoscale biomolecular assemblies are in abundance. Amyloid fibrils are one such self-assembling biological structure, formed when native proteins misfold into insoluble fibrous quaternary structures. This research has explored the use of amyloid fibrils formed from waste proteins, namely crude crystallin proteins from <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> <b>lenses,</b> as biological nanowires. The use of amyloid fibrils as nanowires was investigated by examining {{the ability to control}} their dimensions and arrangement, along with analysis of their properties, such as stability and conductivity. TEM and AFM studies on the model amyloid forming protein, bovine insulin, showed that a number of fibril length distributions can be achieved, by systematically altering fibril growth and storage conditions. Although the same set of conditions cannot be directly applied to crystallin fibrils, these fibrils can also be produced on a range of length scales. Amyloid fibrils can be manipulated and aligned in a controlled manner by dielectrophoresis; this tool could later be used to incorporate amyloid fibrils into a biosensing or bioelectronics device. Dielectrophoresis was also used to immobilise crystallin fibrils between electrode pairs, in order to investigate the conductivity of small numbers of fibrils. These experiments complemented work carried out on the conductivity of amyloid fibril networks, using fabricated interdigitated electrodes. In the unmodified state, amyloid fibrils formed from bovine insulin, fungal hydrophobins, and crude crystallins were all shown to have low conductivity, with current values in the range of 10 ⁻⁸– 10 ⁻¹⁰ A recorded at bias voltages of 0 – 2 V. Amyloid fibrils were used as a template for the synthesis of conductive nanowires, by modification with the conducting polymers polyaniline and polypyrrole, increasing conductivity by one and four orders of magnitude respectively. The functionalisation of fibrils with glucose oxidase enabled the creation of a very simple glucose sensing device. This device, consisting of a gold electrode modified with the glucose oxidase functionalised fibrils, showed an electrochemical response in the presence of glucose and the mediator FcOH. Future work is necessary to optimise the use of amyloid fibrils in this way; however, this study confirms a role for amyloid fibrils from a low cost source in bionanotechnology...|$|R

Our simulation results indicate that if one uses an active coaxial cable as the object and set an array of passive drains around the image region, what one obtains is not an image of the object but only multiple spots resembling the array of passive drains. The resolution of Maxwell's fish eye is finite even with such passive drains at the image locations. We also found that the subwavelength spot around the passive drain is due to the local field enhancement of the metal tip of the drain rather than the fish eye medium or the ability of the drain in extracting waves.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{literature review}} {{about the current}} situation on the implementation of <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring has been performed {{in order to provide}} recommendations regarding dosemeter types, calibration procedures and practical aspects of <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring for interventional radiology personnel. Most relevant data and recommendations from about 100 papers have been analysed and classified in the following topics: challenges of today in <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring; conversion coefficients, phantoms and calibration procedures for <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose evaluation; correction factors and dosemeters for <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose measurements; dosemeter position and influence of protective devices. The major findings of the review can be summarised as follows: the recommended operational quantity for the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring is H p (3). At present, several dosemeters are available for <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring and calibration procedures are being developed. However, in practice, very often, alternative methods are used to assess the dose to the <b>eye</b> <b>lens.</b> A summary of correction factors found in the literature for the assessment of the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose is provided. These factors can give an estimation of the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose when alternative methods, {{such as the use of}} a whole body dosemeter, are used. A wide range of values is found, thus indicating the large uncertainty associated with these simplified methods. Reduction factors from most common protective devices obtained experimentally and using Monte Carlo calculations are presented. The paper concludes that the use of a dosemeter placed at collar level outside the lead apron can provide a useful first estimate of the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> exposure. However, for workplaces with estimated annual equivalent dose to the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> close to the dose limit, specific <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> monitoring should be performed.

The <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose measurements were carried out for three different cone-beam acquisition protocols (standard dose head, low-dose head [LDH], and high-quality head [HQH]) of Varian OBI. Measured doses were correlated with patient geometry and distance between isocenter and <b>eye</b> <b>lens.</b> Measured <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses for standard head and HQH protocols were in the range of 1. 8 - 3. 2 mGy and 4. 5 - 9. 9 mGy, respectively. However, the measured <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose for the LDH protocol was in the range of 0. 3 - 0. 7 mGy. The measured data indicate that <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose to patient depends on the selected imaging protocol.

40|$|In {{a typical}} <b>fish</b> <b>eye,</b> the {{crystalline}} <b>lens</b> {{is the only}} refractive element. It is spherical in shape and has high refractive power. Most fish species have elaborate color vision and spectral sensitivity may range from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet. Longitudinal chromatic aberration exceeds depth of focus and chromatic blur is compensated for by species-specific multifocality of the lens. The complex optical properties of fish lenses are subject to accurate regulation, including circadian reversible adjustments and irreversible developmental tuning. The mechanisms optimize the transfer of visual information to the retina in diverse and variable environments, and allow for rapid evolutionary changes in color vision. Active optical tuning of the lens is achieved by changes in the refractive index gradient and involves layers of mature, denucleated lens fiber cells. First steps have been taken toward unraveling the signaling systems controlling lens optical plasticity. Multifocal lenses compensating for chromatic blur are common in all major groups of vertebrates, including birds and mammals. Furthermore, the optical quality of a monofocal lens, {{such as in the}} human eye, is equally sensitive to the exact shape of the refractive index profile.

40|$|Summary. - We briefly {{tackle the}} {{following}} concepts in the Demkov-Ostrovsky (DO) nodeless sector: (i) orbital impedance, (ii) orbital capacity, (iii) closeness to reflectionlessness. Moreover, using previous supersymmetric {{results for the}} DO problem, a strictly isospectral effect in the DO orbital impedances is discussed and explicit plots are displayed for the Maxwell fisheye lens. This effect, though rather small, is general, that is, it may apply to any focusing structure. PACS 03. 65 - Quantum mechanics PACS 11. 30 - Supersymmetry Because {{of one of the}} optical-mechanical analogies, the DO problem can be stated as a Schrödinger radial (half line) equation at zero energy with the focusing potential Vκ(ρ) = −w/ρ 2 [ρ−κ + ρκ] 2, where w> 0 is a (Sturmian type) coupling constant, ρ is a scaled radial variable (r/R), and κ (> 0) is the Lenz-Demkov-Ostrovsky parameter, which is unity for the Maxwell <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> (MFE) <b>lens,</b> and one half for an atomic aufbau model [1]. In previous works [2], a supersymmetric, Witten approach of the DO problem in the nodeless radial sector n = l + 1 (1 s, 2 p, 3 d [...] .) has been put forward. Moreover, the strictly isospectral double Darboux method has been worked out with the interesting result that a one-parameter family of Maxwell lenses having the same optical scattering properties in the nodeless sector might exist [3]. In this note, still within the same nodeless sector, we will refer to the concepts of DO orbital impedance and orbital capacity. Moreover, we mention a problem that we call “closeness to reflectionlessness”. The strictly isospectral effect [3] is graphically displayed using the language of impedances that may have some advantages not only in technological applications.

Recently, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended a reduction in the annual dose limit for occupational exposure for the <b>lens</b> of the <b>eye</b> from 150 to 20  mSv, averaged over a period of 5  years, with the dose in a single year not exceeding 50  mSv. This prospective study investigated <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dosimetry in anesthesiology practice during a routine year of professional activity. The radiation exposure measured represented the exposure in a normal working schedule of a random anesthesiologist during 1  month and this cumulative <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose was extrapolated to 1  year. Next, <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses were measured in anesthesiology during neuro-embolisation procedures, radiofrequency ablations or vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures. The <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses are measured in terms of the dose equivalent H p(3) with the Eye-D dosimeter (Radcard, Poland) close to the right eye (on the temple). In 16 anesthesiologists, the estimated annual <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses range from a minimum of 0. 4  mSv to a maximum of 3. 5  mSv with an average dose of 1. 33  mSv. Next, <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses were measured for nine neuro-embolisation procedures, ten radiofrequency ablations and six vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures. Average <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> doses of 77  ±  76  µSv for neuro-embolisations, 38  ±  34  µSv for cardiac ablations and 40  ±  44  µSv for vertebro-/kyphoplasty procedures were recorded. The maximum doses were respectively 264, 97 and 122  µSv. This study demonstrated that the estimated annual <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> dose is well below the revised ICRP's limit of 20  mSv/year. However, we demonstrated high maximum and average doses during neuro-embolisation, cardiac ablation and vertebro-/kyphoplasty procedures. With radiation induced cataract being explained as a possible stochastic effect, without a threshold dose, anesthesiologists who regularly work in a radiological environment should remain vigilant and maintain radiation safety standards at all times. This includes adequately protective equipment (protection shields, apron, thyroid shield and leaded eye wear), keeping distance, routine monitoring and appropriate education. status: publishe...|$|R
