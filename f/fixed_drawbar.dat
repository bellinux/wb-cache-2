50|$|In North America, {{the ball}} {{attaches}} to a ballmount. Receiver-type hitches use removable ball mounts, whereas the <b>fixed</b> <b>drawbar</b> type hitches have integrated ball mounts. The ball mount must match the SAE hitch class. The ballmount for a receiver-type hitch is a square bar that fits into a receiver {{attached to the}} vehicle. Removable ball mounts are offered with varying rise or drop to accommodate variations in {{the height of the}} vehicle and trailer to provide for level towing.|$|E
50|$|The Fast Hitch was IH's {{answer to}} the three-point hitch {{developed}} years earlier by Harry Ferguson, and featured on Ford-Ferguson tractors. The Fast Hitch was first offered as an option on the Super C. Fast Hitch was then an option on the 100, 200, 300, and 400 and some later models. However, even the Fast Hitch had three incompatible variants (100—single prong, 200—two small prongs, 300/400—two large prongs). IH discontinued the Fast Hitch in the 1960s after the three-point hitch was standardized and adopted by all manufacturers. There are kits available {{from a variety of}} sources that will either convert a Fast Hitch to a three-point, or add a three-point hitch to tractors that originally only had a <b>fixed</b> <b>drawbar.</b>|$|E
