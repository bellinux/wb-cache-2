For {{with the increase of}} business transactions in both time and space, the telling of the truth has become a financial necessity. Without <b>it,</b> <b>trade</b> would come to a standstill at once.

60|$|This American government--what is it but a tradition, {{though a}} recent one, endeavoring to {{transmit}} itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing {{some of its}} integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It {{is a sort of}} wooden gun to the people themselves. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by <b>it.</b> <b>Trade</b> and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.|$|E
