25|$|Sometimes in Plautus (but not in Terence) {{there can}} be a hiatus (i.e. no <b>elision)</b> between vowels at the break between the two halves of a verse, that is after the fifth element of a senarius or the 8th element of a septenarius. There can also be brevis in longo at this point. But {{frequently}} at the break there is no hiatus but an <b>elision.</b> <b>Elision</b> can also take place when there is a change of speaker {{in the middle of a}} line.|$|E
25|$|In Greek and Latin poetry, hiatus is {{generally}} avoided, {{though it does}} occur in many authors under certain rules {{with varying degrees of}} poetic licence. Hiatus may be avoided by <b>elision</b> of a final vowel, occasionally prodelision (<b>elision</b> of initial vowel) and synizesis (pronunciation of two vowels as one without change in writing).|$|E
25|$|Such <b>elision</b> is rare or {{sporadic}} in {{the other}} dialects.|$|E
50|$|Bridges {{notes that}} Milton allows himself {{a wider range}} of <b>elisions</b> in the later poems. In {{particular}} he finds one instance apiece of <b>elisions</b> through SH and ST which he states are 'abhorrent' to the prosody of Paradise Lost.|$|R
50|$|<b>Elisions</b> are {{relatively}} common.|$|R
50|$|There are {{strictly}} speaking no <b>elisions</b> of any kind.|$|R
25|$|In both {{words the}} medial velar -k- drops out via <b>elision.</b>|$|E
25|$|The prefixes /t-/, /y-/, /ni-/ have <b>elision</b> of /i/ {{following}} /ka-/ or /ɣa-/.|$|E
25|$|The prefixes ti-, yi-, ni- have <b>elision</b> of i {{following}} bi- or ḥa-.|$|E
50|$|The post-generator {{makes any}} {{necessary}} orthographic changes {{due to the}} contact of words (e.g. <b>elisions).</b>|$|R
50|$|The tables below {{summarize}} {{the forms of}} the definite article, its <b>elisions,</b> and its contractions.|$|R
5000|$|In French, <b>elisions</b> are {{mandatory}} in certain contexts, {{as in the}} clause [...] (elided from *).|$|R
25|$|In many languages, {{especially}} European languages, the apostrophe is used {{to indicate}} the <b>elision</b> {{of one or more}} sounds, as in English.|$|E
25|$|The {{apostrophe}} ’ indicates <b>elision,</b> and is {{not necessarily}} written. Those forms of lenited p that are pronounced f are written ph as mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|The prefixes ti-, yi-, ni- have <b>elision</b> of i {{following}} bi- or ḥa- (all verbs whose stem {{begins with}} a single consonant behave this way).|$|E
5000|$|Historically, medieval Catalan {{also used}} the symbol [...] as a marker for certain <b>elisions,</b> much like the modern {{apostrophe}} (see Occitan below), and hyphenations.|$|R
25|$|Note the <b>elisions</b> in mult(um) and ill(e) in {{the third}} line. For a fuller {{discussion}} of the prosodic features of this passage, see Dactylic hexameter.|$|R
5000|$|Neologisms - New word formations. These {{may also}} involve <b>elisions</b> of two {{words that are}} similar in meaning or in sound. e.g. [...] "I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the geshinker." ...|$|R
25|$|Names {{that are}} not {{strictly}} native to English sometimes have an apostrophe substituted to represent other characters (see also As a mark of <b>elision,</b> below).|$|E
25|$|French {{feminine}} singular possessive adjectives do not undergo <b>elision,</b> but {{change to}} the masculine form instead: ma preceding église becomes mon église ("my church").|$|E
25|$|Vowel <b>elision</b> can be {{syntactically}} conditioned. For example, in nominal {{compounds and}} noun phrases, all adjectival/nominal modifiers {{with three or}} more vowels in a modifier + nucleus NP lose their final vowel.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the example}} of Gratwick in his edition of the Menaechmi edition, and Barsby in his edition of Terence's Eunuchus, the {{position}} of the strong element in each foot in the iambo-trochaic metres is marked in this article, but with an accent rather than a sublinear dot. It is argued that this can help the reader with syllable division, the recognition of <b>elisions,</b> and division into feet. This is especially so in lines such as the following iambic septenarius (Terence Phormio 820), where the three <b>elisions</b> (s(um), ses(e), fratr(i)), the brevis brevians (utŭt), and the pronunciation of meae as one syllable by synizesis make the rhythm of the line difficult for the untrained reader unless the ictus is marked: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>ELISION's</b> {{activity}} in music theatre/opera production, most recently The Navigator (composer Liza Lim, director Barrie Kosky; Brisbane and Melbourne 2008, Moscow and Paris 2009), {{can be viewed}} as a continuation of an artistic relationship which began in 1993 with performances of The Oresteia(Melbourne 1993).|$|R
50|$|Methodologically, person-centered {{interviewing}} {{also depends}} on a fair degree of experience in self-monitoring for transference and countertransference phenomena, as well as attention to <b>elisions,</b> avoidances, and gaps in an interviewees' answers and attention to interviewees' emotional reactions during and outside the formal interview setting.|$|R
25|$|Vowel <b>elision</b> {{is allowed}} with the {{grammatical}} suffix -o of singular nominative nouns, and {{the a of}} the article la, though this rarely occurs outside of poetry: de l’ kor’ ('from the heart').|$|E
25|$|In Italian it is {{used for}} <b>elision</b> with pronouns, as in l’ha instead of la ha, articles, as in l’opera instead of la opera, and for truncation, as in po’ instead of poco.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} type of lenition, the {{articulation}} becomes more open with each step. Opening lenition involves several sound changes: shortening of double consonants, affrication of stops, spirantization of stops or affricates, debuccalization, and finally <b>elision.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some {{languages}} {{employing the}} Latin alphabet, such as English, the omitted letters in a contraction {{are replaced by}} an apostrophe (e.g., isn't for is not). Greek, which does not use the Latin alphabet but instead uses the Greek alphabet, marks <b>elisions</b> in the same way.|$|R
60|$|At Tetbury by noon.--I hope, {{after it}} is sent, {{there will be no}} more <b>elisions.</b> It is not now so long--73 lines--two less than allotted. I will alter all Committee objections, but I hope you won't permit Elliston to have any voice whatever,--except in {{speaking}} it.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflection}} of determinatives is complex, specially {{because of}} the high number of <b>elisions,</b> but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, like dels ("of + the plural"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).|$|R
25|$|In Plautus, {{there is}} usually a clean break between {{the two halves of}} the line, and this is often true of Terence too. However, {{sometimes}} Terence smooths over the break with an <b>elision,</b> or even omits the break altogether.|$|E
25|$|Modern Spanish {{no longer}} uses the {{apostrophe}} to indicate <b>elision</b> in standard writing, {{although it can}} sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose. Instead Spanish writes out the spoken <b>elision</b> in full (de enero, mi hijo) except for the contraction del for de + el, which uses no apostrophe. Spanish also switches to a form that {{is identical to the}} masculine article (but is actually a variant of the feminine article) immediately before a feminine noun beginning with a stressed a instead of writing (or saying) an elision: un águila blanca, el águila blanca, and el agua pura but una/la blanca águila and la pura agua. This reflects the origin of the Spanish definite articles from the Latin demonstratives ille/illa/illum.|$|E
25|$|In Irish, {{the past}} tense of verbs {{beginning}} with an F or vowel begins with d' (<b>elision</b> of do), for example do oscail becomes d’oscail ("opened") and do fhill becomes d’fhill ("returned"). The copula is is often elided to s, and do ("to"), mo ("my") etc. are elided before f and vowels.|$|E
5000|$|In Old Occitan, {{the symbol}} · was {{sometimes}} used to denote certain <b>elisions,</b> {{much like the}} modern apostrophe, the only difference being that the word that gets to be elided is always placed after the interpunct, the word before ending either in a vowel sound or the letter n: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{inflection}} of determinatives is complex, specially {{because of}} the high number of <b>elisions,</b> but is similar to the neighboring languages.
