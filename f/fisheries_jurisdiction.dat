40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The {{increased}} US {{domestic production}} of surimi from the US Pacific Coast after 1977 {{is a major}} consequence of the US's extended <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to 200 nautical miles. It is only one consequence, however, whose nature can best be understood by examining the surimi market {{in the context of}} what happened to fish production and marketing on a global basis, following the extended <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> worldwide. The objective of this thesis is to analyze what effect, if any, the global extension of <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> had on the production, prices and markets for fish, in which the surimi market is considered to be representative of what occurred globally. The analysis is a preliminary "case study" of the broader phenomenon in testing econometrically the hypothesis that Extended <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> (EFJ) increased the potential for new product forms from existing stocks, led to greater levels of global interdependence in seafood markets and, even with little or no change in total harvest, resulted in increased prices. In theory, price changed due to a change in the availability to the surimi markets of fish traditionally used in surimi production and the appearance of some value added products in the market. The results reported in this thesis show that there is not enough statistical evidence to make conclusions about the specific sources of changes in the surimi market prices, after the EFJ, but support the idea that the EFJ did have a significant and gradual impact on the Alaska pollock fishery...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of national <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to the two-hundred-mile limit enabled maritime nations to allocate increased {{shares of the}} fish catch off their shores to their own fishermen. The Atlantic groundfish catches of Canada and the United States are sold primarily on the American market. A Nerlovian inventory adjustment-price expectations model is estimated for the American demand for groundfish. Income and price elasticities are perverse. The ability of the American market to absorb the increased anticipated catches are therefore limited, and benefits of extended <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> will be lost unless marketing arrangements are substantially changed. Key words: demand functions, extended <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> fisheries. With the {{expansion of}} national fisheries juris-diction to the two-hundred-mile limit, maritime nations gained the ability to enforce regulations restricting operations of foreign fishing fleets in the expanded area under their control. Implicit in this control {{is the ability to}} capture a larger share of the harvest for the controlling nation. Foreign marketing prob-lems may arise if the expanded harvests ex-ceed domestic consumption. A fishery may be unable to reap the benefits of extended <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> (EFJ), how-ever, if the marketing structure is such that price and income elasticities are perverse. For example, if the supply of fish to the United States increases dramatically because of greater catches by American fleets as well as by fleets of countries which export fish to the United States; then, if price elasticities are low, extreme reductions in fish prices may be required to enable the American market to absorb the increased supply. With high in-COme elasticities for fish products in the United States, demand will be highly volatile, responding dramatically to cyclical behavior in the U. S. economy.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Bycatch {{mortality}} of Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis, in nontarget fisheries is composed primarily of immature fish, and substantial reductions in yield to directed halibut fisheries result from this bycatch. Distant-water bottomtrawl fleets operating off the North American coast, {{beginning in the}} mid 1960 ’s, experienced bycatch {{mortality of}} over 12, 000 t annually. Substantial progress on reducing this bycatch was not achieved until the of extension <b>fisheries</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> by the United States and Canada in 1977. Bycatch began to increase again during the expansion of domestic catching capacity for groundfish, and by the early 1990 ’s it had returned to levels seen {{during the period of}} foreign fishing. Collaborative action by Canada and the United States through the International Pacific Halibut Commission has resulted in substantial reductions in bycatch mortality in some areas. Methods of control have operated at global, fleet, and individual vessel levels. We evaluate the hierarchy of effectiveness for these control measures and identify regulatory needs for optimum effects. New monitoring technologies offer the promise of more cost-effective approaches to bycatch reduction...|$|R
40|$|Subsequent to {{extension}} of <b>fishery</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in 1977 it was Canadian policy to favour the inshore sector in {{rehabilitation of the}} Canadian groundfish fishery. Catch allocation, limited entry licensing and vessel replacement policies were implemented, which at first allowed and then increasingly attempted to limit inshore fleet expansion, which was being encouraged through financial assistance programmes. New regulatory authorities wer obtained {{to deal with the}} increasingly difficult task of limiting annual harvests to catch quota levels. A 1986 study concluded that the licensed capacity of the Nova Scotia inshore fleet was approximately four times that required to exploit the resource at target levels. As a result of a government task force report released in January 1990, substantial changes were made in the control of fishing by inshore fleets, including establishment of an individual boat catch quota system for some sectors. This article documents the regulatory actions taken to date to control inshore fleet development and annual fishing activities, and the responses of fishermen to these, as a possible guide to the implementation of new approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{enactment}} of the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA) of 1976 it was widely anticipated that extension of <b>fishery</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to 200 miles by the United States would result in substantial economic benefit to the domestic fishing industry. The traditional analyses of exploited fisheries show that {{in the absence of}} controls on entry into the domestic fishery, exclusion of foreign fleets will only yield temporary economic rents which will eventually be dissipated by additional domestic fishing effort. This paper examines post-MFCMA trends for the New England Otter Trawl fleet {{to determine the extent to}} which this hypothesis holds. By using a simulation program for this fishery, revenues and costs for representative vessels from four major New England ports from 1976 to 1982 were calculated and factor rents to owners, captains, and crew were estimated. For three of the four ports considered, the estimated real economic surplus for the typical vessel peaked in 1977 - 1978 and declined dramatically through 1982. While this finding indicates that some of the potential rents from the fishery may have been dissipated by a substantial increase in fleet size, other indicators show that this decline in economic surplus may have been due to exogenous factors and not rent dissipation as predicted by standard models.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we investigate}} rights based management. The transition from {{free access to}} regulated fisheries with tools like limited entry and quotas (of different degrees of transferability) meant an important evolution {{in the way of}} understanding fisheries problems and managing them efficiently. Extended <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> gave the coastal states property-rights and the potential of a sustainable management of their fisheries resources. For many fisheries economists it was a "promise of abundance". In practice, without a policy of overcapacity reduction, and in the presence of multiple social and political constraints, these conclusions were reserved. Also, the problems of "unfinished business" in the Law of the Sea (1982), namely imprecise definition of rights in the areas of High-Seas adjacent to the EEZs and the consequent difficulties in the management of straddling stocks, make it necessary to revisit the "Tragedy of the Commons" and the oldest issue: free access / excess of effort / overfishing.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 {{took effect}} on March 1, 1977. By this Act the United States {{extended}} its management over fisheries to 200 nautical miles from shore. Extended <b>fishery</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{was expected to}} promote industry development and expand {{the contribution of the}} fishing industry to the economies of the coastal regions. Benefits to the Pacific Coast groundfish industry have, however, been less than were expected when the Act was passed. A spatial equilibrium model was formulated for the broader United States interregional/international groundfish market. Two steps were involved: First, a system of simultaneous econometric equations was estimated {{for each of the three}} product forms—fresh and frozen cod, ocean perch, and flounder fillets. Second, regionalized forms of these equations were collapsed into simple equations and combined with transportation and storage costs in a larger mathematical programming model. The resulting quadratic programming (QP) problem was then solved (for each product) for the competitive equilibrium quantities demanded and supplied, prices, and product movements. Two objectives were achieved: A model was formulated that accounts for most of the relevant factors influencing the United States groundfish market; and the multiregional nature of this market was established. The estimated price and income elasticities were similar to those suggested by earlier studies, and the estimated product movements were consistent with survey data in the Pacific Northwest. The various policies evaluated in this study (using the spatial equilibrium model) suggest mixed blessings to the Pacific Coast groundfish industry. There is no evidence to suggest that harvesting some average quantities uniformly throughout the year would improve industry revenues. In general, increasing Pacific Coast landings by 30 percent (or more) would depress wholesale revenues but substantially increase fleet revenues. On the other hand, both wholesale and fleet revenues would increase if at least 80 percent of the increase in landings could be sold in markets outside the region. This suggests that an industry policy aimed at expanding landings on the Pacific Coast will improve revenues for all industry participants only if access to outside markets also takes place...|$|R

Both countries have gained substantial shares of the Japanese and European markets, but Canada's share of the U. S. market has declined due to increased competition from U. S. domestic producers.
