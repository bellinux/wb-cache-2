40|$|The {{activated}} leukocyte {{cell adhesion}} molecule (ALCAM) mediates dynamic homotypic and heterotypic cellular interactions. Whereas homotypic ALCAM-ALCAM interactions have been implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of tissue architecture and tumor progression, heterotypic ALCAM-CD 6 interactions act to initiate and stabilize T-cell-dendritic-cell interactions affecting T-cell activation. The ability to resist the forces acting on the individual bonds during these highly dynamic cellular contacts is thought to be crucial for the (patho) physiology of ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to characterize the relationship between affinity, avidity and the stability of ALCAM-mediated interactions under external loading, at the single-molecule level. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton resulted in enhanced ALCAM binding avidity, without affecting the tensile strength of the individual bonds. Force spectroscopy revealed that the ALCAM-CD 6 bond displayed a significantly higher tensile strength, a smaller reactive compliance and an up to 100 -fold lower dissociation rate in the physiological <b>force</b> <b>window</b> in comparison to the homotypic interaction. These results indicate that homotypic and heterotypic ALCAM-mediated adhesion are governed by significantly distinct kinetic and mechanical properties, providing novel insight into the role of ALCAM during highly dynamic cellular interactions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Compensation {{of brain}} injury in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) may in part work through mechanisms involving neuronal plasticity on local and interregional scales. Mechanisms limiting excessive neuronal activity may have special significance for retention and (re-) acquisition of lost motor skills in brain injury. However, previous neurophysiological studies of plasticity in MS have investigated only excitability enhancing plasticity and results from neuroimaging are ambiguous. Thus, {{the aim of}} this study was to probe long-term depression-like central motor plasticity utilizing continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive brain stimulation protocol. Because cTBS also may trigger behavioral effects through local interference with neuronal circuits, this approach also permitted investigating the functional role of the primary motor cortex (M 1) in force control in patients with MS. Methods We used cTBS and force recordings to examine long-term depression-like central motor plasticity and behavioral consequences of a M 1 lesion in 14 patients with stable mild-to-moderate MS (median EDSS 1. 5, range 0 to 3. 5) and 14 age-matched healthy controls. cTBS consisted of bursts (50 [*]Hz) of three subthreshold biphasic magnetic stimuli repeated at 5 [*]Hz for 40 [*]s over the hand area of the left M 1.

Corticospinal excitability was probed via motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle over M 1 before and after cTBS. Force production performance was assessed in an isometric right thumb abduction task by recording the number of hits into a predefined <b>force</b> <b>window.</b> Results: cTBS reduced MEP amplitudes in the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis muscle to a comparable extent in control subjects (69 ± 22 % of baseline amplitude, p < 0. 001) and in MS patients (69 ± 18 %, p < 0. 001). In contrast, postcTBS force production performance was only impaired in controls (2. 2 ± 2. 8, p = 0. 011), but not in MS patients (2. 0 ± 4. 4, p = 0. 108). The decline in force production performance following cTBS correlated with corticomuscular latencies (CML) in MS patients, but did not correlate with MEP amplitude reduction in patients or controls. Conclusions: Long-term depression-like plasticity remains largely intact in mild-to-moderate MS.

We propose documenting the concepts as a new architectural style. This paper initially describes the architectural properties, elements, views, and constraints of this style.

Russian commanders then ordered their forces to open fire on the village with mortars, howitzers and rocket launchers. American correspondent Michael Specter reported that the Russians were [...] "firing into Pervomaskoye {{at the rate of}} one a minute - the same Grad missiles they used to largely destroy the Chechen capital Grozny when the conflict began." [...] Specter noted: [...] "The Grads fell with monstrous concussive force throughout the day. In this town, about four miles away, where journalists have been herded by Russian <b>forces,</b> <b>windows</b> cracked at the force of the repeated blasts ... Mikhailov said today that he was adding up the Chechen casualties, not by number of corpses, 'but by the number of arms and legs.'" [...] Barsukov later joked that [...] "the usage of the Grad multiple rocket launchers was mainly psychological", and CNN reported that [...] "the general's answers were openly mocking." [...] Among Russian troops deployed to the village was an FSB agent from Nalchik, Alexander Litvinenko, whose ad-hoc squad came under friendly fire from Grad rockets. Heavy losses (including friendly-fire incidents) triggered a collapse in morale among the Russian forces. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer reported that [...] "based on information from observers and participants of the fighting, it can be concluded that Interior Ministry officers {{were on the verge of}} mutiny."
