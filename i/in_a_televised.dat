After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila.

The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré.

Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E
