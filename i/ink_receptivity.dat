40|$|Continuous tone printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a continuous tone step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A continuous tone step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment continuous tone step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of <b>ink</b> <b>receptivity)</b> corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{examined the}} printing {{characteristics of the}} association product plate, a continuous tone lithographic process which utilizes a synthetic, light-sensitive coating variably ink-receptive according {{to the degree of}} exposure it receives. The methodology was designed to determine (1) the printing range of the plate, (2) the effective sensitivity of the coating to varying amounts of exposure within this range, and (3) the degree to which adherence to ideal tone reproduction could be achieved through systematic variation of exposure. The plate is not commercially available, therefore it was necessary to consult patent literature and prior research to obtain details of the coating composition and plate manufacture. A number of pre-trial tests were conducted to optimize the manufacturing process and achieve a desirable balance of coating resiliency and printability. After optimizing plate manufacture, equal-interval continuous tone gray scales were printed on a conventional lithographic press to determine the printing characteristics of the plate. The characteristic curves which were generated by plotting printed densities against negative densities revealed low highlight contrast and high midtone and shadow contrast within a relatively narrow log exposure range of. 75 - 1. 10. Faulty tone reproduction can often be corrected by modifying the contrast gradients of the film negative(s) used for plate exposure. In halftone lithography, this procedure selectively alters dot area to achieve desired print reflectance. In the case of continuous tone processes, tone corrected negatives selectively modify the <b>ink</b> <b>receptivity</b> of the plate coating. VIII In order to test the effects of exposure modulation on the tone reproduction characteristics of the plate, an optical matrix was sensitometrically generated from continuous tone panchromatic film. Various film development techniques were used to alter negative contrast and obtain gray scales with diverse equal-interval log E increments within the response range of the plate. The matrix was used for exposing plates of similar manufacture to generate print data for analysis. Printed densities obtained from the matrix were used to construct conventional characteristic curves, as well as response profiles relating printed density differences to log exposure increments. A mathematical model of the Jones tone reproduction diagram was used to calculate tone correction factors in terms of relative log exposure and to reconstruct tone corrected negative scales. Printed densities obtained from the test matrix were used to gauge the effect of the corrected scales on tone reproduction. This method, in essence, emulated the Jones-type approach to tone correction in a single print run, thereby reducing manufacturing and printing variables. The data revealed a high degree of success in correcting mid-tone and shadow reproduction through exposure modification. Although some areas of non-linear plate response were persistent, these were primarily due to shortcomings in the methodology rather than plate failure. Optical tone correction of the low highlight contrast was significantly more problematic. Given the relatively short printing range of the plate, the required negative gradient eliminates many original tonal values. Other means physical and/or chemical are required to lengthen the tonal range and raise highlight contrast in order to improve overall plate performance...|$|E
