5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a <b>high-voltage</b> static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara <b>high-voltage</b> capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new <b>high-voltage</b> line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{is used in}} vacuum tubes, <b>high-voltage</b> indicators, {{lightning}} arresters, {{wave meter}} tubes, television tubes, and helium–neon lasers. Liquefied neon is commercially used as a cryogenic refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more extreme liquid helium refrigeration.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under <b>high-voltage</b> power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses a {{combination}} of double-circuit three-level pylons and single-circuit delta pylons to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages, such as 315kV. The ±450kV <b>high-voltage</b> direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, <b>high-voltage</b> transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, <b>high-voltage</b> discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the <b>high-voltage</b> batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1890s, Tesla {{would pursue}} his ideas for {{wireless}} lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his <b>high-voltage,</b> high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements {{on the possibility}} of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.|$|E
5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The <b>high-voltage</b> system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its <b>high-voltage</b> components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October 1944, Lent flew his Junkers Ju-88 from Stade to Paderborn. His crew {{included}} his long-time {{radio operator}} Walter Kubisch, {{the member of}} a Propagandakompanie (Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops) in the aerial gunner position, and a second radio operator. Lent {{was on his way}} to visit the Geschwaderkommodore of the Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, Hans-Joachim Jabs. During the landing approach, the left engine of the plane failed, causing the wing to dip. Lent was unable to keep the plane steady and it struck <b>high-voltage</b> cables and crashed. All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive. Three crew members succumbed to their injuries by the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using <b>high-voltage</b> electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of <b>high-voltage</b> equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} NY96 between exit29 and NY250 in Perinton {{serves as a}} major {{commercial}} strip, anchored {{by the presence of}} Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NY96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NY96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by <b>high-voltage</b> power lines and a large ditch.|$|E
5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using <b>high-voltage,</b> high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded homes. At {{the height of the}} storm, <b>high-voltage</b> electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of Tampico and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two more deaths were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through contaminated water. Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) of rain and claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings. Landslides left dozens of communities isolated, and more than 600residents fled from flooded areas, particularly in Ciudad Valles, Tamazunchale, El Naranjo, and Xilitla.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, <b>high-voltage</b> DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is <b>high-voltage</b> alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between <b>high-voltage</b> power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or <b>high-voltage</b> devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
25|$|<b>High-voltage</b> {{capacitors}} {{may benefit}} from a pre-charge to limit in-rush currents at power-up of high voltage direct current (HVDC) circuits. This extends {{the life of the}} component and may mitigate <b>high-voltage</b> hazards.|$|E

25|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} networks are protected {{and controlled by}} <b>high-voltage</b> breakers. The definition of high voltage varies but in {{power transmission}} work is usually thought to be 72.5kV or higher, {{according to a recent}} definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). <b>High-voltage</b> breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. In substations the protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.|$|E

The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information. Nissan also published a guide for first responders that details procedures for handling a damaged 2011 Leaf at the scene of an accident, including a manual <b>high-voltage</b> system shutdown, rather than the automatic process built-in the car's safety systems.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 1951, {{a grenade}} damaged a <b>high-voltage</b> cable outside Masouda Shem-Tov Synagogue. Three, or four Jews were killed, {{including}} a 12-year-old boy, and ten were wounded.|$|E
