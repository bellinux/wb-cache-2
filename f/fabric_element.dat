Foliation is separated into two groups: primary and secondary. Primary deals with igneous and sedimentary rocks while secondary deals with rocks that undergo metamorphism as a result of deformation.

40|$|Ductile sheared {{rocks of}} the Higher Himalayan Crystalline unit (HHC) in micro-scale reveal {{flanking}} microstructures defined by nucleated minerals (the cross-cutting elements, CEs), and deflected cleavages and grain margins (the host <b>Fabric</b> <b>elements,</b> HEs) of other minerals. Depending on different {{or the same}} senses of drag across the cross-cutting elements, the flanking microstructures are grouped into Type 1 or Type 2 varieties, respectively. Cross-cutting elements of Type 2 flanking microstructures connote post-tectonic directional growth. The cross-cutting elements of the Type I flanking microstructures consistently demonstrate top-to-SW non-coaxial shearing in the Higher Himalayan Crystalline unit. Here the external host <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> bounding the cross-cutting elements act as the C-planes. These cross-cutting element minerals are usually parallelogram-shaped, underwent crystal-plastic deformation and their nucleations are pre- or syntectonic. The facts that the host <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> are dragged even in absence of rheological softening at {{the boundaries of the}} cross-cutting elements, and that the cross-cutting elements are non-rigid, indicate strong bonds between the host <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> and the cross-cutting elements. Salient morphological variations in the flanking microstructures are: (1) variable intensity and senses of drag along the single and the opposite crosscutting element margins; (2) host <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> defined only at one side of the cross-cutting elements; and (3) presence of a thin hazy zone at the HE-CE contacts. The observed cross-cutting element minerals are either of nearly the same or of greater competency than the mineral grains which host them...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of fabric {{is of interest}} {{in a number of}} applications including those that manufacture or handle textiles, garments, and composite materials. There has also been considerable interest recently from the computer graphics industry where virtual environments, models and actors are widely used in clothing design, movies, and video games. Of particular interest in this thesis is the {{dynamics of}} fabric in rotating horizontal drums such as those found in clothes washers and dryers. ^ In order to provide a tool for designing more efficient methods of mixing fabric, several simplified discrete element computational models were developed for modeling fabric dynamics in a rotating horizontal drum. The geometry is essentially a horizontal ball mill, but with the media consisting of fabric rather than rigid particles. Because modeling the interactions between actual pieces of fabric is quite complex, three simplified models are proposed. The first model treats a <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> as being balled up {{so that it can be}} represented geometrically as a circular “bundle. ” The second model treats a <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> as being twisted so that it can be represented geometrically as a series of connected circular particles referred to here as a “fiber. ” The fiber model is further classified as being either a rigid fiber or a completely flexible fiber. The rigid fiber model is not considered to be an accurate representation of fabric behavior, but is included nevertheless in order to demonstrate the effects of fiber aspect ratio. The completely flexible fiber model incorporates large aspect ratio effects in addition to fabric flexibility. The models are used to perform a large number of parametric studies investigating the effects of bundle/fabric density, baffles, drum fill percentage, normal contact force models, coefficient of restitution, friction coefficient, bundle diameter, fiber thickness and length, and drum rotation speed and rotation profile. Measurements of the forces, power, and torque are reported to provide insight on fabric dynamics. ^ The simulation results indicate that fill percentage, rotation speed, rotation profile, and friction coefficient play significant roles in the bundle/fiber dynamics. Smaller fill percentages result in greater power dissipation per <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> due to increased relative movement between elements. Rotation speeds just below the centrifuging speed and rotation profiles with large accelerations also result in large specific powers. Friction coefficients that are sufficiently small result in rocking of the fabric load and very small normal to tangential power ratios. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|Crustal-scale tabular shear {{zones are}} common {{features}} of transpressional orogens and arcs. Though foliation development in shear zones is well understood, {{the development of}} another rock <b>fabric</b> <b>element,</b> lineation, is not. Computer modeling shows that monoclinic solutions for lineations are unstable; triclinic models better explain the variation of lineation in natural transpressional zones. This thesis investigates an example of natural lineation variation in three segments of the Sierra Crest shear zone system, Sierra Nevada, California. Field data collected during large-scale mapping indicate an early (Paleozoic?) generation of deformation overprinted by a Cretaceous, dextral, reverse (west-over east), steeply-dipping shear zone active for ~ 20 Ma. A third generation of deformation overprints previous fabrics. Estimates of shear zone volume reduction are correlated with volumetrically-complementary emplacement of the Sierra Nevada batholith across strike. Disagreement between single-domain model predictions and field observations is interpreted as being due to heterogeneous strain localization on many scales...|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{simulations}} {{have indicated}} optimum insulation thicknesses of walls’ insulation {{for a variety}} of cases. Simplified analytical relations have also been proposed to the same aim, allowing the extraction of more general results, with limited accuracy however, as imposed by mathematical simplicity requirements. In this sense, a variety of important parameters are ignored, such as: the existence of any glazing at the wall, the absorptance of the wall, the base temperature of the heated space which the referred to wall belongs to and its variation with insulation, the thermal characteristics (thermal capacitance, total heat losses coefficient) and the heat and solar gains of the heated space. An alternative analytical approach is consequently developed here, incorporating all above parameters and in this context accessing the wall as part of the whole heated space, instead of considering it solely as an isolated <b>fabric</b> <b>element.</b> The approach consists of a set of two implicit equations which are easily solved, and enables the investigation of the effects of all principal and secondary parameters on the optimum thickness.

40|$|Laser Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is particularly}} {{well suited for}} routine characterization of the crystalline and the better ordered paracrystalline silica phases occurring in silica sinters: opal-C, quartz and moganite. The non-crystalline and poorly ordered paracrystalline silica phases (opal-CT and opal-A) are identified with difficulty, {{partly as a result}} of the high level of fluorescence exhibited by the younger sinters that are dominated by these phases, and {{partly as a result of}} the ill-defined nature of the broad phonon scattering bands produced by them. Nonetheless, given the limited number of phases present and the high level of phonon scattering from the better ordered phases, judicious use of a Raman microprobe enables the character of most siliceous microtextural sinter components to be determined readily. Microprobe examination of a series of New Zealand sinters, ranging from Late Quaternary to Pliocene in age shows that a silica phase inhomogeneity that exists in some outcrops reflects an underlying phase heterogeneity obtaining in the microstructure of the sinter; it is a consequence of the phase transformation process. In the older sinters, quartz, moganite and opaline cristobalite may be present in a single <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> but in quite different proportions to their abundance in adjacent elements. Identification of opaline lepispheres partially pseudomorphed by quartz+moganite and the association of quartz+moganite in microcrystals exhibiting common quartz forms, cautions against the use of morphology as a means of identifying silica phases at the microstructural level...|$|E
40|$|Veins {{occurring}} {{at the edge}} of the dextral Indian Islands Fault (Newfoundland) are folded in response to a fault-parallel, ductile shear. The veins, which locally constitute a penetrative <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> at outcrop scale, are composed mainly of calcite and have a narrow rim of quartz and chlorite. Both the calcite and quartz are generally fibrous and lattice distortion in the calcite is not commensurate with the observed degree of fibre curvature. This observation supports the popular view that curved fibres grow curved as they track the vein opening vector. It is demonstrated, however, that the curvature in the material described here is due to deformation and that the lack of strong lattice distortion is due, in part, to polygonization and to recrystallization. All observations are consistent with both the calcite and the quartz fibres having grown perpendicular to the vein walls. The chlorite orientation is controlled by the orientation of mica grains in the country rock. In some veins, markers make it possible to define the net opening direction and, in all examples, it is demonstrated that the direction has not been tracked by the fibres. Since this conclusion may be more generally applicable. caution should be exercised in interpreting kinematics on the basis of fibre geometry. Where vein density is high, the veins and country rock screens separating them form a multilayer sequence that is folded into fairly harmonic folds. The folds appear to have a cleavage transected relationship to the regional cleavage, but the cleavage is shown to predate the folds...|$|E

30|$|Kang and Lee (2015) {{reported}} on the electrical heating property of a <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element</b> with CNF nanocomposite coated on nylon fabric. A <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element</b> with carbon nanofiber composite was prepared {{in the size of}} 12  ×  12  cm. The surface temperature indicated that the <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element</b> with 16 wt% CNFs/PVDF-HFP composite at 20  V was up to 89.1  °C, but fluctuations were present. Ilanchezhiyan et al. (2015) studied electrical heating properties with CNT coated cotton fabrics for flexible/wearable heating applications. CNT based cotton heaters were considered with short and long dimensions (1  ×  2 and 2  ×  4  cm). For the CNT based cotton heater with short dimensions, the steady-state temperature at 20  V reached 55.0  °C, and for the one with long dimensions it was up to 35  °C. In this study, when a voltage of 20  V was applied, the CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated on a cotton fabric with various circuit patterns showed a surface temperature of more than 60  °C. In particular, P 3 and 2 P 3 presented a uniform heating distribution of the surface temperature of 71.7  ±  9.0 and 75.7  ±  7.7  °C at an applied voltage of 20  V. Thus, it was confirmed that the CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated on a cotton fabric with decreasing conductive lines exhibited an excellent electrical heating property, and the use of a smaller amount of the CNF/PVDF-HFP composite than that of the plane <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element</b> can help achieve a reduction in cost.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Bibliography: leaves 107 - 111. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The origin of fault zone structure is not completely understood. On the basis of mechanistic models of faulting, {{the character}}istic internal structure of faults may largely be established early during growth of the fault, or it may develop throughout the faulting history as the result of wear during sliding along established fault surfaces. Microfractures are a common <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> in fault zones and form in particular orientations that are related to the stress state at the time of formation. Thus, microfracture fabric may be used to investigate the origin of the internal structure of fault zones. I have conducted a study of the microfracture fabric within the Punchbowl fault zone, an exhumed, large-displacement, strike-slip fault of the San Andreas system. Open, healed, and sealed microfractures were analyzed with respect to density and orientation as a function of distance from the fault. Microfracture density decreases with distance from the fault core to background levels at approximately 100 meters from the fault surface. Microfractures display preferred orientations within about 30 meters of the fault surface, and fairly random fabric at greater distances. Within a very narrow zone (2. 5 meters from the fault surface), microfractures occur in preferred orientations approximately parallel and perpendicular to the Punchbowl fault. Between approximately 2. 5 and 15 meters from the fault surface, microfractures are preferentially oriented perpendicular to the fault surface and to the slip vector of the fault. The fabrics of the open and healed microfractures are similar. These data are most consistent with progressive microfracture development associated with wear during Punchbowl fault movement, and further suggest that the average stress state was maintained throughout much of the faulting history...|$|E
40|$|The Niobrara Formation, Denver-Julesburg (DJ) and Piceance basins, Colorado, {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{unconventional}} petroleum plays in the United States. This study characterizes those pore systems in one well in the DJ Basin and two wells in the Piceance Basin in order to isolate the impact of lithologic variability on pore characteristics. This objective is accomplished through the combination of scanning electron microscopy of Ar-milled rock surfaces, image analysis with Avizio 9 software, and mineralogical characterization by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and electron microprobe mapping. The twenty-one imaged samples span the chalk to marly shale lithologies of the Niobrara Interval. This study focuses on the pre-hydrocarbon migration pore systems in order to minimize the influences of differential hydrocarbon saturations, surface wettability, and post-migration thermal maturation. The goal of this project is to understand the basic lithologic controls on the pore systems. Data on size, shape, and orientation of individual pores were collected and compared to lithology (weight percent calcium) and grouped by <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> to establish trends that can be related to well-scale observations. Total pre-migration porosity positively correlates to lithology (r = 0. 93) with a range of 3. 4 % to 11. 7 %, with the chalkiest samples showing the greatest porosity. Median pore size, width, anisotropy, and degree of horizontal orientation also all correlate, to varying degrees, with lithology. Overall, pores associated with peloids (always calcitic) and calcitic matrices (chalk and marly chalk) consistently display the largest sizes (medians of ~ 175 nm), most equant shapes, and smallest horizontal preference. In contrast, pores in clay-rich, calcite-poor matrices (marl and shaley marl) are the smallest (medians of ~ 150 nm), most elongate, and most horizontal. Petroleum explorationists should guide drilling toward zones of the highest calcite and peloid concentrations in order to find the largest and best connected pore systems. Pairing this information with an understanding of the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon saturations will help identify the most favorable petroleum resources in the Niobrara Formation...|$|E
40|$|Formation {{conditions}} of olivine microstructures are investigated in the Kittelfjäll spinel peridotite (KSP), {{a fragment of}} lithospheric mantle which occurs as an isolated body within high grade metamorphic crustal rocks of the Seve Nappe Complex (SNC), southern Västerbotten, central Sweden. The KSP is an orogenic peridotite containing a well developed penetrative compositional layering, defined by highly depleted dunite with olivine Mg# (100 × Mg/Mg + Fe) of 92. 0 – 93. 5 and harzburgite with lower Mg# (91. 0 – 92. 5). Dunite is characterized by three contrasting olivine microstructures formed in response to different tectonometamorphic events: Coarse-grained, highly strained olivine porphyroclasts (M 1) up to 20 cm long are surrounded by dynamically recrystallized olivine grains (M 2) defining a characteristic olivine “foam” microstructure (grain size: 200 – 2000 μm). An olivine “mortar” (M 3) microstructure (10 – 50 μm) forms a penetrative <b>fabric</b> <b>element</b> only in strongly localized, cm-to-m sized shear zones that crosscut earlier structures/foliations. Olivine fabric analysis in synergy, with mineralogical and chemical analyses, reveals that the KSP body represents old, possibly Archean, sub-continental lithospheric mantle that was crustally emplaced into the Caledonian tectonic edifice from the hanging wall mantle during exhumation of the subducted Seve Nappe Complex (Jämtlandian orogeny ~ 454 Ma). Olivine porphyroclasts (M 1) grew at high temperature during dominant isobaric cooling after extensive polybaric melt extraction (> 40 %) and subsequent refertilization. The onset of the early Caledonian deformation is interpreted {{to be related to}} the crustal emplacement of the KSP during eduction of the SNC. This phase is characterized by the development of the olivine M 2 foam microstructure, formed at 650 – 830 °C/ 1 – 2 GPa by dislocation creep processes producing an E-type CPO's by the operation of the [100](001) and subordinate [001](100) slip systems with operating flow stress levels around 8 – 48 MPa. In contrast the M 3 olivine “mortar” microstructure formed at 550 – 600 °C/ 0. 45 – 0. 6 GPa and represents deformation after the subducted slab had returned to shallow crustal levels. It is proposed here that the presence of a penetrative olivine M 2 “foam” microstructure can be used as an easy tool in the field to discriminate between mantle wedge (i. e. sub-continental affinity), ophiolite (i. e. sub-oceanic affinity), and/or hyper-extensional peridotite in the Scandinavian Caledonides. The latter two peridotite subtypes may have similar M 2 microstructures, but exclusively restricted to the structural base of the bodies. Alternatively in basal parts of ophiolites, M 3 microstructures directly overprint coarser grained proto-granular olivine microstructures...|$|E

40|$|A {{useful tool}} to {{document}} structural inversion inside a shear zone is {{the identification of}} overprinted structures, which can increase {{the complexity of the}} internal fabric of shear zones. In the case of thrust faults, shear zones can also be problematic due to the occurrence of structures connected to flexural slip along bedding in the recumbent forelimb. Therefore identification of superimposition among different structures can help to distinguish among these configurations inside a shear zone. In Central Apennines (Italy), favourable conditions along the outcrop of Mt. Tancia’s thrust allowed the discovery of two sets of superimposed <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> referring to two opposite senses of shear. The first is related to thrusting (top-to-E–NE), whereas the second is likely associated to reactivation in normal sense (top-to-W–SW). The <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> have been mapped and their distribution inside a semi-brittle shear zone has been defined. High angle extensional shear planes occurring only in the uppermost part of the shear zone (closest to the main thrust plane) have been interpreted as a new generation of C-planes, connected to negative reactivation, instead of Riedel shear planes. The overprinting relationship defined inside the shear zone helps in discriminating whether the observed structures developed in the footwall of the main thrust or on the recumbent limb of the hanging wall’s anticline. The deformation inside the shear zone can be described using a simple shear model at the outcrop scale, where reoccurrence of fibrous calcite on shear C-planes should control rotation of S-planes; these are dissolution planes parallel to the XY-plane of the local strain ellipsoid. At thin section scale, instead, veins maintaining the same orientation suggest a coaxial deformation due to repeated crystallization events controlled by fluid pressure and differential stress variation...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{collated}} from dierent {{parts of}} the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift (bar-ring the Charnockite Zone") indicates that this sector evolved {{through a series of}} com-pressive structures (F 1 to F 3), with prolic migmatization in quartzofeldspathic and metapelitic gneisses synchronous with F 1 shortening, as was the syn- F 1 emplacement of profuse megacrystic K-feldspar-bearing granitoid bodies. Thereafter, melt productivity of the rocks (synchronous with F 2 - F 3 folding) sharply decreased. Mineral parageneses stable in the S 1; S 2 and S 3 fabrics indicate persistence of granulite facies conditions. P-T estimates on orthopyroxene + garnet + plagioclase + quartz assemblages anchored to recrystallized mosaic that overgrow all penetrative <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> in mac granulites, granitoids and quartzofeldspathic gneisses are in the range of 900950 C and P = 89 kbar. This estimate is comparable to those retrieved from sapphirine-bearing paragen-esis in Mg-Al metapelites that appear to be diachronous in relation to the <b>fabric</b> <b>elements,</b> and arguably disrupt the granoblastic mosaic. These facets in the northern sector of the orogenic belt are compatible with either a single cycle of tectonic events (i. e., F 1; F 2 and F 3 in continuum), or temporally-separate thermo-tectonic events, with the peak of earlier metamorphism (pre- to syn-F 1) at lower temperature (in the granulite facies) in comparison to the record of high post-F 3 -Tmax values. It is suggested {{on the basis of the}} above evidence that the late Proterozoic/Pan-African granulites in the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift, are unlikely to be reworked equivalents of any older granulitic crust, such as the 1. 6 Ga granulites south of the rift. Instead, the temporally disparate sectors may represent dierent crustal segments with unconnected pre-amalgamation tectonic history. However, if the 1. 6 Ga granulites of the Western Charnockite Zone continue northwards across the rift, as suggested by recent isotope data, there are serious doubts as to the validity of a north-south division within the Eastern Ghats belt. 1...|$|R

P 0 was used as the referencesample. P 0 showed a surface resistance of 1.2  ×  103  Ω/sq at a current of 0.85  A and an electric heating temperature of 76.9  °C.

The sample code of P 0 designates a reference sample, while P 3, P 5 and P 7 were used when the number of horizontal lines was 3, 5, and 7, respectively; patterns in which a vertical line was added to the horizontal lines were named 2 P 3, 2 P 5, and 2 P 7, respectively. The surface resistivity values ranged from 1.01  ×  103 to 1.65  ×  103  Ω/sq, and it was thus confirmed that the samples with various circuit patterns exhibit excellent electrical characteristics. The resistances of P 3 and 2 P 3 were lower than those of fabric heaters with 5 and 7 lines, and it is thus presented that the effect of the resistance is less affected by the decrease in the number of lines. Comparing patterns, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed slightly lower resistances than 2 P 7, 2 P 5 and 2 P 3, indicating that the line in the vertical direction slightly increased the resistance. For electrical heating temperature, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed more uniform heating performance than P 0 and the circuit with the added vertical line had a higher surface temperature than P 7, P 5, and P 3 in terms of joule heating. 2 P 3 had the best heating performance, and the surface temperature was similar to P 0 at about 76  °C. In terms of mechanical properties and water repellency, it was confirmed that the coated fabrics had higher values compared to the uncoated fabric. Therefore, we confirmed that the electrical heating performance of the <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element</b> coated with carbon nanocomposite in three lines is improved compared to that of the plane <b>fabric</b> heating <b>element,</b> and it is also confirmed that it is more economical, flexible and lightweight than the conventional products because of its use of a smaller amount of carbon nanocomposite. Thus, it is suitable for use as a functional material for electric heating. <b>Fabric</b> heating <b>elements</b> that employ a CNF/PVDF-HFP composite with various circuit patterns have potential applicability in extreme work environments, for active winter sports, cold military training, and wet suits that must maintain body temperature in water.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{scientific}} discoveries {{are driven by}} analyses of massively distributed bulk data. This {{has led to the}} proliferation of high-end mass storage systems, storage area clusters and data centers as storage <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> for the Grid, offering excellent price/performance ratio and good storage speeds, but increasing maintenance and administrative costs. A promising alternative then, is to harness the collective storage potential of individual workstations much as we harness the idle CPU cycles due to the affordable economics in aggregating commodity storage and low usage to available space ratio. However, such aggregated commodity storage is prone to volatility, machine failures, performance concerns and trust issues. In this paper, we address several of the aforementioned issues and present our design on the construction of scalable aggregated commodity storage through scavenging; providing availability through aggressive replication; revering user autonomy and his authority to reclaim space; and enabling Grid access to such storage.

40|$|ArticleReproduced with {{permission}} of the publisher. Copyright © 2010 American Geophysical UnionA comparative study of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and K-feldspar phenocryst fabrics in the Land’s End Granite demonstrates that the AMS fabric predominantly reflects late magmatic deformation. Tensor analysis of the K-feldspar fabric shows a complex pattern, characterized by meter-scale variations in orientation, symmetry and intensity, mainly related to heterogeneous flow of the phenocryst-rich magma during emplacement. In contrast, the AMS fabric is predominantly homogenous, subhorizontal and oblate, and is stable at pluton scale. Quantitative microstructural analysis suggests that the AMS fabric is controlled by deformation of the partially crystallized matrix, resulting from the combined effects of late internal adjustment within the pluton and regional deformation. A general model of fabric development associated with a vertical pure-shear overprint on a variable vertical fabric is evaluated by numerical modeling. The study demonstrates how the memory of different <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> may be dependent upon their grain size, crystallization sequence and recorded previous strain...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} elements of the stadium is the external facade which consists of <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> resembling {{the trunk of a}} palm tree that also can be lighted by LED lights in 15 different content modes. On the top of the stadium roof, 200 floodlights are fixed to provide the illumination of after-dark soccer games. Due to the extreme temperatures during the hot summer months, the palm bowl shape of the roof also provides pleasant conditions for both the players and the fans. It is one of the stadium's unique features, which is designed in a way that matches can take place in the shadow after 5pm. On the inside, it reveals the complex geometry of its cantilevered steel trusses, which was achieved by using robotic cutting and welding technology. The stadium is the first stadium in the world to featuring a unique parasol roof designed specifically to fully shade all fans.|$|R
40|$|Possible genetic {{relationships}} between syn- and post-depositional processes and sediment microstructure were investigated. Samples from cores at Sites 646 and 647 of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 105 included examples of bottom current deposition (contourites), turbidity current deposition, consolidation, and diagenesis. Examination of nearly 200 micrographs of 14 samples from Site 646 and 13 samples from Site 647 {{leads to the}} conclusion that sedimentation processes do not appear to have an obvious influence on fabric. The effects of post-depositional processes, such as bioturbation, coring disturbance, and even remolding, appear to be less significant than one might expect {{as a result of the}} relatively coarse grain size of the sediments studied. Consolidation resulting from increased overburden stress results in increased particle alignment and compression of <b>fabric</b> <b>elements</b> with depth. The transition from open, random fabric in shallow samples to preferred orientation at depth represents the only change in these sediments that can be ascribed directly to a specific depositional or post-depositional process. Mineralogical variations, owing to changes in weathering processes and growth of authigenic/diagenetic minerals, also have a pronounced effect on sediment fabric...|$|R
