25|$|In 1977, {{a single}} {{standard}} BN-2 was re-engined with Dowty Rotol ducted fans. The <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion, some structural {{strengthening of the}} main wing spar at the root was required due to the extra weight. This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> {{as a means of}} reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{an unusual}} configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin, reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter, that provides 270° panoramic vision and almost vertical downward {{vision for the}} pilot and two passengers. The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a high-mounted tailplane. It {{is powered by a}} Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch <b>ducted</b> <b>fan.</b> Due to the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan,</b> the aircraft is exceptionally quiet. The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left. The wings are unswept and untapered. The aircraft is of fairly standard all-metal construction with stressed skin of aluminium.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, the Bell Rocketbelt was {{presented}} to the public. The jet of gas was provided by a hydrogen peroxide-powered rocket, but the jet could also be provided by a turbojet engine, a <b>ducted</b> <b>fan,</b> or other kinds of rockets powered by solid fuel, liquid fuel or compressed gas (usually nitrogen).|$|E
25|$|While early {{interest}} in the Fantrainer was limited, RFB concentrated on the light tourer, which was named the Fanliner, with the intention {{that it would be}} able to act as a testbed for <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> installations for the Fantrainer as well as a prospective production aircraft in its own right. RFB entered into a joint venture with Grumman American to develop the Fanliner, allowing the use of components from existing Grumman American light planes.|$|E
25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are wind-powered vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} shroud around them (<b>ducted</b> <b>fan)</b> or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} with airfoils that rotate around a vertical axis.|$|E

25|$|The Stipa-Caproni, also {{generally}} {{called the}} Caproni Stipa, was an experimental Italian aircraft designed in 1932 by Luigi Stipa (1900–1992) and built by Caproni. It featured a hollow, barrel-shaped fuselage {{with the engine}} and propeller completely enclosed by the fuselage—in essence, the whole fuselage was a single <b>ducted</b> <b>fan.</b> Although the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) {{was not interested in}} pursuing development of the Stipa-Caproni, its design was an important step in the development of jet propulsion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Hanno Fischer, Technical Director of Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB), {{developed}} {{an interest in}} aircraft powered by ducted fans integrated into the aircraft structure, flying two modified gliders as testbeds, a VFW-Fokker FK-3 fitted with an eight-bladed <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> in the rear fuselage, which flew as the Sirius I in 1969, and a Caproni Vizzola Calif A-21, which flew as the Sirius II on 16 December 1971. Based on the successful results of testing of these aircraft, RFB decided to start work on a two-seat ducted-fan military trainer, intended to offer jet-like handling at low cost, which became the RFB Fantrainer, while in 1972, RFB began studies on a two-seat light touring aircraft with side-by-side seating.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 and 1993, Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation {{included}} an entry on the 1910 aircraft, {{calling it the}} [...] "Coanda turbine" [...] and describing it as [...] "the world's first jet-propelled aircraft to fly". In 2003, Winter co-authored a book with fellow NASM curator F. Robert van der Linden: 100 Years of Flight: A Chronicle of Aerospace History, 1903–2003. In the book the Coandă-1910 is described as an unsuccessful <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> aircraft lacking documentation to substantiate any flight test.|$|E

500|$|Coandă's 1910s-era patents {{describe}} the inline piston engine's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers {{in contact with}} the central air flow, then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow. The turbo-propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating [...] of thrust. The powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms: a turbine without propellers, turbo-propulseur, <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> or a suction turbine.|$|E
500|$|The Coandă-1910, {{designed}} by Romanian inventor Henri Coandă, was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft {{powered by a}} <b>ducted</b> <b>fan.</b> Called the [...] "turbo-propulseur" [...] by Coandă, its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi-bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct. The unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a propeller, but the aircraft was not displayed afterwards and it fell from public awareness. Coandă used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sledge, {{but he did not}} develop it further for aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The Avro VZ-9 Avrocar was a [...] "dead end" [...] in VTOL design, {{according}} to Russell Lee, {{curator at the}} National Air and Space Museum, yet its technological innovations have intrigued other designers. One of the design elements it embodied, the use of ducted fans, led to other experimental programs. Dr. Paul Moller, a Canadian expatriate who had worked at Avro Canada as a young engineer, based an initial series of experimental VTOL vehicles on [...] "saucer" [...] technology utilizing the buried <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> à la-Avrocar. The XM-2, {{the first of the}} series looked remarkably like a miniature flying saucer. After successful tether tests, the saucer designs also at one time publicized as [...] "discojet" [...] were abandoned and their latest project, the Moller Skycar, has a flying-car appearance.|$|E

5000|$|A Skycar is not piloted like a {{traditional}} fixed wing airplane, and has limited pilot controls, which the pilot uses {{to inform the}} computer control system of the desired flight maneuvers. [...] The Skycar's <b>ducted</b> <b>fans</b> deflect air vertically for takeoff and horizontally for forward flight. The <b>ducted</b> <b>fans</b> encase the propellers and engines, which prevents bystanders from being exposed to moving blades as well as improving aerodynamic efficiency at low speeds and generating lift in forward flight.|$|R
500|$|A {{symposium}} titled [...] "Supersonic-Transport Implications" [...] was {{hosted by}} the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines. Boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone but Dr. Seddon of the RAE saw [...] "a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes" [...] in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines [...] situated behind a single intake. An intake failure {{could lead to a}} double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag. At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.|$|E
500|$|Michelson {{directed}} various efforts {{pertaining to}} future transportation. His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research {{began to focus}} almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those {{with the power of}} flight. [...] He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS). [...] One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system. [...] It also could be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use. [...] Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of global positioning system (GPS) reference signals. [...] Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a micro air vehicle (MAV) known as the entomopter. [...] The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for slow flight in Mars' lower atmosphere.|$|E
