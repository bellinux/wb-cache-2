40|$|The conference {{committee}} for the {{annual conference of the}} Australian Teacher Education Association (ATEA) facilitates the review of all papers for admission to the conference. Abstracts for all papers presented are reviewed by the organising committee as to suitability for presentation as research at the annual conference, but full paper refereeing is optional. Only papers actually presented at the conference are published on the ATEA website. Refereed papers were subject to a thorough and anonymous peer review process that involved a blind review of the research publication in its entirety by <b>independent</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>experts</b> from the field of teacher education. Provisionally accepted papers were returned to the author/s for revision before inclusion in the conference proceedings. The refereeing system was administered by the ATEA Conference Convenor and committee, and conducted independent of the ATEA Executive Committee, which does not influence the selection of peers. The results of the peer review process are reported directly to the authors and recorded by the Conference Convenor. Papers are identified as referred or non-refereed by an against the relevant category unde...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of social work supervision in non-governmental non-profit organizations. Supervision is a staff support tool, a form of learning; it ensures the quality of provided services and is also a very important measure against burnout syndrome. The theoretical part focuses on the definition of supervision, its origin and development. The implementation of supervision to organizations is influenced by various factors, which are addressed in this thesis. Supervision is one of the ways for promoting an <b>independent</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>expert</b> for social workers, as imposed by the Social Service Quality Standards. The aim of this thesis is to determine what entails the implementation of social work supervision to non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services in the district of Chrudim. The practical part presents results of qualitative research. Hypotheses are defined in the conclusion. The research questions are: - What are the obstacles to the implementation of supervision to non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services? How is supervision accepted by workers of non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services? How is supervision accepted by directors/managers of non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services? The research was carried out in the form of interviews, using the technique of semi-standardized interview with directors and workers of selected organizations. The section Results shows results of the interviews with directors and workers. In the discussion I deal with the results and focus on the areas I wanted to explore in particular?that is, I am looking for answers to the research questions. The answer to the first question is that the obstacle to the implementation of supervision to non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services is represented by the lack of financial resources. The answer to the second and third questions is that the staff as well as the directors of non-governmental non-profit organizations providing social services accept supervision positively. At the end of the discussion, I provide three hypotheses based on the answers to the research questions...|$|R

40|$|Three major Federal {{legislative}} enactments seek {{to enable}} overseas and military voters to cast valid ballots securely in Federal elections. The most recent legislation includes federal mandates and preemptive provisions that require State and local election administration officials {{to offer their}} overseas voters the ability to transmit materials electronically, such as remote voter registration forms and absentee ballot applications. This paper contends that our current knowledge of the technical and security infrastructure that exists at the State and local election administrative offices is insufficient to enable the UOCAVA and MOVE Acts to be fully realized while concomitantly protecting the integrity of Federal elections. Topical areas for <b>independent</b> research by <b>qualified</b> <b>experts</b> include voter information privacy protections and defense-in-depth security policies and practices [...] the latter of which relates closely to achieving system and service reliability and data integrity and accuracy. The paper contends that if electronic "best practices," technical and security standards, and other Federal election policies are promulgated without sound baseline knowledge of existing conditions, serious but avoidable problems are likely to arise. These include (1) Phase–In Planning Omissions arising from potentially false assumptions regarding the technical infrastructural status quo; (2) Insufficient Budgets for ongoing technical and security management that may undermine election success and MOVE Act implementation; and (3) Voter Privacy, Security, and Reliability Objectives that may be undermined with significant new yet avoidable risks {{that may not be}} manageable within the current infrastructure, and thus not effectively remedied. Thus, policymakers and standards-setting agencies cannot meet the larger public interest and MOVE Act objectives without sound data (which can be anonymized to exclude names of the jurisdictions) and expert evaluations of the existing technical infrastructure within which local and State election administrators must function...|$|R
