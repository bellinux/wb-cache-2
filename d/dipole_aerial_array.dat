The model representations of the radiation generation mechanisms on cyclotron frequencies and processes of interacting particles with aerial surface have been developed.

40|$|The complex {{electrodynamic}} analysis holding for <b>dipole</b> <b>aerials</b> in a {{wide range}} of the modification of inpur parameters, in that number parameters of excitation sources, on the base of the solution of integral equations with singular nuclei is the aim of the paper. As a result the new high effective munerical-analytical method for the solution of integral equations of <b>dipole</b> <b>aerials</b> has been suggested. The structure of exact integral equations of cylindrical, belt vibrators and also a belt vibrator near a screen has been investigated. The integral equations obtained have been reduced to infinite systems of algebraic equations of the second kind. The numerical-analytical method has been suggested for the solution of these equations. The system of integral-differential equations has been obtained. Singular operators of the non-axially symmetric excitation have been investigated. Algorithms and programs have been developed on the base of the base of the numerical-analytical method suggested.

The single mast sloping <b>dipole</b> log periodic <b>aerial</b> is given particular attention. Computer programmes and approximate formulae are developed for both free-space and above-ground designs. The far field of these aerials is shown to be predictable from near field data.

40|$|The aim is {{to create}} the new methods for design and {{construction}} of the small-size <b>dipole</b> <b>aerials,</b> mainly, on base of the symmetric dipoles. It has been proved that the integral equation of the impedance dipole is the second-order Fredholm equation in the Hilbert space and has only the single generalized solution. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution decomposition coefficient according to the basis has been studied. The numerical-analytical method for solution of the integral equation has been constructed, and the efficiency of this method for solution of the concrete problem has been investigated. The high-effective algorithms and programs for complex electrodynamic analysis of the small-size impedance <b>dipole</b> <b>aerials</b> with distributed impedance and concentrated load operating steadly at change of the input dipole parameters and load parameters have been developed on base of the numerical-analytical method.

Once more avery long <b>aerial</b> <b>array</b> 48 metres long and about 8 metres high was used, employing a cylindrical paraboloid.

50|$|Jagdwagen: Jagdwagen was {{designed}} as a mobile Panoramic radar to control fighters at close ranges immediately behind the front. It was a project of the firm of Lorenz. The aerials were considerably smaller than the Jagdhütte, the array being only 8 metres long. The <b>aerial</b> <b>array</b> was to be mounted on the Kumbach stand as used in the Egerland Flak set.

2500|$|Antenna gain is {{sometimes}} measured as decibels {{relative to a}} half-wave dipole, {{which means that the}} antenna in question is being compared to a dipole, and has a certain amount of gain relative to a dipole antenna tuned to the same operating frequency. In this case, one says the antenna has a gain of [...] "x dBd" [...] (see decibel). More often, gains are expressed relative to an isotropic radiator, which is an imaginary antenna that radiates equally in all directions. In this case one uses dBi instead of dBd (see decibel). As it is impossible to build an isotropic radiator, gain measurements expressed relative to a dipole are more practical when a reference <b>dipole</b> <b>aerial</b> is used for experimental measurements. 0 dBd is often considered equal to 2.15 dBi.|$|R

A distinctive diamond-shaped DF aerial was fitted on the cabin roof, replacing the loop antenna. Other Australian improvements included fully enclosed landing gear and Browning M2 [...]5 in machine guns in the wings.

In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate new half wave dipole antenna for GSM Applications. A dipole antenna approximately onehalf wavelength long is the half wave dipole antenna. The antenna is made to resonate at the 1. 995 GHz frequency. CST MWS Software is used for the simulation and design calculations of the half wave dipole antennas. The return loss, VSWR, Directivity, gain, radiation pattern are evaluated. Using CST MWS simulation software proposed antenna is designed/simulated and optimized.

A directional <b>aerial</b> <b>array</b> was used to avoid wasting power over the English Channel and to enhance the signal {{to the east and}} west.

A comprehensive aerial system was installed consisting of 29 arrays supported between 15 masts of heights varying between l00 ft and 325 ft. Full world coverage was given by this aerial system, although the transmissions were primarily intended for areas outside Europe.
