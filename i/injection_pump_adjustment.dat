50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed under Hans Scherenberg’s leadership, and was introduced by Goliath and Gutbrod in 1952 to power some of their two-stroke cars. This system made by Bosch was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an intake throttle valve set up. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) It used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The two-stroke vehicles showed very good performance and up to 30% less fuel consumption over the carburetor version, primarily under low engine loads. The cars enjoyed an extra benefit as the injection system also metered lubricant into the engine from a dedicated oil tank, obviating the need for owners to mix their own two-stroke fuel blend. A portion of the oil was combined with fuel in the <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> to lubricate the cylinders and piston rings, the rest was ported to the air intake to lubricate the crankcase. But the cars were expensive and difficult to start when the engine was warm due to vapor locks. Also, very few people knew about direct injection, and the <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> needed frequent <b>adjustment.</b> Branded repair shops and Bosch services became overloaded, and many cars were converted to carburetor. These two-stroke engines were soon superseded by four-strokes.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor <b>Injection</b> <b>pump</b> at low pressure. The distributor <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|R
40|$|The Baccalaureate Thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} tool for fixing of thrust rings in flanges of high {{pressure}} fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pumps.</b> The theoretical part of the final project summarizes both theory-based and cold metal and alloy working-based knowledge.

The high pressure fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> flange is made of AlSilMgMn aluminium alloy. The thrust ring is made by C 75 sheet steel stamping according to DIN 17222 (ČSN 12081). The tool drawing was made on the basis of the best-fit technology repair option. Stamping tools are made of 19 452 steel and hardened to HRC 60 - 4. The assumed yearly output amounts to 7000 pieces.

40|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>pumps</b> {{constitute}} {{an essential component}} for many industrial applications. The main focus {{of this study is}} to predict the effect of the size of the pipeline on the cross flow injection process. A test-rig was designed, built and equipped with three different pipelines, 1 ½", ¾" and ½" diameters. Comparison was made under constant line pressure of 40 -bar and line flow rate of 5 liter/min, with a fixed <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed of 100 rpm. The main parameter tested was the injection dose capacity at different pump displacements. Cross flow mixing process is also theoretically studied using 3 D-CFD analysis to show the injection cross flow behavior for the same geometry and parameters used for experimental test. Results show that increasing the size of the pipeline increases <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> doses ability. This effect is insignificant at lower <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> displacements, while the effect of the size of the pipeline becomes dominant when increasing the displacement. By changing the size of the pipeline from ½" to 1 ½" diameter <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> dose capacity increases by 3. 24 % at 100 % pump displacement. Selecting larger pipe sizes for injection ports is recommended whenever possible...|$|R

The PMD contains two power transistors that should be cooled by proper contact with the <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> body. If the pump is not precisely machined to make complete contact with the transistors via the silicone thermal gasket and paste, the PMD is improperly installed without the gasket or paste, the PMD is installed off center with the pump body, or corrosion develops on the mounting surface the PMD will overheat. Several companies manufacture an extension harness and heat-sink kits.
