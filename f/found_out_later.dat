25|$|A {{man came}} in before I left, who I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with}} a drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Avery {{asserted}} {{that this was}} the film he wanted to make due to the new information he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> and due to the funding and distribution he was offered; in addition, with many firefighters, survivors and witnesses going to him about events of that day, he felt it was necessary to update the film. David Ray Griffin was a script consultant and radio host Alex Jones was associated with the production of this film as well. This was over two hours long, had a new musical score, and included additional interviews and new information that was not available in the prior versions.|$|E
500|$|As the 1876 Republican {{convention}} approached {{during the}} U.S. Presidential Election, President Grant, unknown to Fish, {{had written a}} letter to Republican leaders to nominate Fish for the Presidential ticket. The letter was never read at the convention and Fish was never nominated. President Grant believed that Fish was a good compromise choice between the rival factions of James G. Blaine and Roscoe Conkling. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a caricature of Fish and Rutherford B. Hayes as the Republican Party ticket. [...] Fish, who was ready to retire to private life, did not desire to run for President and was content at returning to private life. [...] Fish <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> President Grant had written {{the letter to the}} convention.|$|E

His fiancée, controversial actress Raffaella Ponzo, <b>found</b> <b>out</b> days <b>later</b> {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. She gave birth to his son on 19 May 2008.|$|R
50|$|Clark was {{apparently}} aware that Pete and Erin had been dating {{before anyone else}} in the office. He appeared somewhat amused at Pete's awkwardness around Andy before Andy <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> and <b>later</b> <b>found</b> it funny when Andy later hired Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice to work with him to get back at him.|$|R
500|$|The script sold in April 1973. It was Weinstein's first {{professional}} sale and credit as a writer. He <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that year {{that it would}} be used as the opening episode of the second season. Weinstein organized a get together in his dormitory to watch the episode when it aired, which some thirty people and a dog attended. After the script was used, Weinstein found that it enabled him to write the Star Trek novel The Covenant of the Crown for Pocket Books; he said in a later interview that it gave him [...] "instant credibility" [...] with the company. He also began to appear at science fiction conventions and later wrote several further Star Trek books and comic books. Weinstein received a [...] "Thank You" [...] credit on [...] after introducing that film's director, Leonard Nimoy, to the idea of including whales in the film.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, Wigram was {{involved}} in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. He was shot in the back, but was not aware of it at the time. He only <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> when he opened his backpack to find a bullet embedded in his soap-dish.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said before, I didn't {{understand}} their plot at first. They {{said it was}} only a schoolboy trick. But it was not,--as I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later.</b> It was a villainous plan to get you into serious trouble." ...|$|E
60|$|Rose looked {{worthy of}} her name as she stood smiling to herself over a happier secret than any Phebe had a secret which {{she did not know}} herself till she <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> some years <b>later,</b> the magic of good health.|$|R
50|$|Zoey {{does her}} best to explain and she manages {{to get them to}} listen until Erik shows up and reveals her {{infidelity}} and her relationship with Loren. This shatters Damien and the Twins' last bit of faith in her. On the way back she is seized by a series of spasms, and <b>founds</b> <b>out</b> much <b>later</b> that they came from her Imprint with Loren breaking as he died.|$|R
5000|$|While McGrath {{was working}} for the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee, the group was charged with being a Communist-front organization, and the FBI {{conducted}} surveillance of its members. McGrath later recalled, [...] "The FBI would come to neighbors asking questions. I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> much <b>later</b> through the Freedom of Information Act that committee's file was filled with lies. I was much more concerned in those days because they could take anybody and put them away." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> on {{that she}} must have lowered him in the very dust, for the lie was {{originally}} the father's not the daughter's, and she thus obliged to persevere {{in it for the}} man's reputation. But at the time I was ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her destitution and the perils in which she must have fallen, had ruffled me almost beyond reason.|$|E
60|$|Well, my {{life was}} saved--saved by that accident. I don't know what the bird thought about that {{interposition}} of Providence, but I felt very, very comfortable over it--satisfied and content. Now, we <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>later,</b> that Laird had hit his mark four times out of six, right along. If the duel had come off, he would have so filled my skin with bullet-holes that it wouldn't have held my principles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never seed his beat fer wisdom, Mister Vigo," [...] said Bill Cowan, now in {{good humor}} once {{more at the}} {{prospect}} of rum and tobacco.

Hain't we a-goin' on to St. Vincent because he seen the Ha'r Buyer sculped on the Ohio?" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1960, Obama met Stanley Ann Dunham in a basic Russian {{language}} {{course at the}} University of Hawaii and they started dating. After becoming pregnant, Dunham {{dropped out of the}} University of Hawaii after the fall 1960 semester, while Obama continued his education. Obama married Dunham in Wailuku on the Hawaiian island of Maui on 2 February 1961. He eventually told Dunham about his previous marriage in Kenya, but said he was divorced—which she <b>found</b> <b>out</b> years <b>later</b> was not true.|$|R
50|$|The {{first part}} was about Taylor's friend Suzanne, who died while Taylor was in London {{working on his}} first album after being signed to Apple Records.

5000|$|David Fincher {{neglected}} to inform me that Woodruff and Gillis were also contracted {{to take care}} of the redesign of the Alien - I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> much <b>later...</b> I thought I had the job and that Woodruff and Gillis would work from my plans. On their side, they were convinced that it was their job and accepted my 'suggestions' with pleasure. They believed that all my effort was based on a huge love for the matter, because I worked hard even after my contract was over.|$|R
60|$|She {{had half}} {{expected}} the Metis to grumble, {{but they did}} not. It looked as if Thirlwell had carefully chosen his men, and she <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that no fatigue she could bear troubled them. After a time, the wind dropped as they ran round a bend, and getting close to the high bank, they began to pole. At dusk they ran the canoe aground on a sheltered beach, and Agatha landed, feeling very tired and cold. When supper was over and they sat by the fire {{she did not want}} to talk, and, going to her tent, soon fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|I {{should have}} got better prices if I worked my things on wool or {{scratched}} them on camel-bone {{instead of using}} mere {{black and white and}} colour. Verily, they are a queer gang, these people. Limited isn't the word to describe 'em. I met a fellow the other day who {{told me that it was}} impossible that shadows on white sand should be blue,--ultramarine,--as they are. I <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>later,</b> that the man had been as far as Brighton beach; but he knew all about Art, confound him. He gave me a lecture on it, and recommended me to go to school to learn technique. I wonder what old Kami would have said to that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have always}} been together. He trusted me, and I trusted him, and we saw things through together. When I was ill, he used to sit up all night with me, night after night. Once--I'd only got a little fever, really, but I thought I was terribly bad--I heard him come in late, and called out to him, and he came {{straight}} in, and sat and held my hand all through the night; {{and it was only}} by accident I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that it had been raining and that he was soaked through. It might have killed him. We were partners, Jimmy, dear. I couldn't do anything to hurt him now, could I? It wouldn't be square." ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{produced}} by Harry Alan Towers for Udastex Films. It starred Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu, Richard Greene as Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, and Howard Marion-Crawford as Dr. Petrie. The movie was filmed in Spain and Brazil. Shirley Eaton appears in a scene she claimed she was never paid for; apparently the director Jesus Franco inserted some footage of her from another of her films (The Girl from Rio, 1968) into the Fu Manchu movie without telling her. She only <b>found</b> <b>out</b> years <b>later</b> {{that she was in}} a Fu Manchu film.|$|R
5000|$|Brahms's {{first known}} {{use of the}} title Ein deutsches Requiem was in an 1865 letter to Clara Schumann in which he wrote that he {{intended}} the piece to be [...] "eine Art deutsches Requiem" [...] (a sort of German Requiem). Brahms was quite moved when he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> years <b>later</b> that Robert Schumann had planned a work of the same name. German refers primarily to the language rather than the intended audience. Brahms told Carl Martin Reinthaler, director of music at the Bremen Cathedral, {{that he would have}} gladly called the work [...] "Ein menschliches Requiem" [...] (A human Requiem).|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{said there}} was a survey of the whole {{orchestra}} and more than 80 percent of the orchestra was against me. I asked the management 'was that true?' and was told, ‘Yes, it's true.' It was not true at all. As I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> a little <b>later,</b> this survey never happened ... All of the musicians regretted very, very much that it was reported like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. I sold every {{shred of}} canvas I wanted to; and, on my word, I {{believe it was}} because they {{believed}} I was a self-taught flagstone artist.

60|$|Then Jerry, {{whose name}} is Geraldine only in the family Bible, talked to her about the weather. Jerry can talk {{interestingly}} about anything. In five minutes she had performed a miracle--she had made Miss Ponsonby laugh. In five minutes more she was leaning half {{out of the window}} showing Miss Ponsonby a new, white, fluffy, frivolous, chiffony waist of hers, and Miss Ponsonby was leaning halfway out of hers looking at it eagerly. At the end of {{a quarter of an hour}} they were exchanging confidences about their favourite books. Jerry was a confirmed Kiplingomaniac, but Miss Ponsonby adored Laura Jean Libbey. She said sorrowfully she supposed she ought not to read novels at all since her father disapproved. We <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> on that Mr. Ponsonby's way of expressing disapproval was to burn any he got hold of, and storm at his daughter about them like the confirmed old crank he was. Poor Miss Ponsonby had to keep her Laura Jeans locked up in her trunk, and it wasn't often she got a new one.|$|E
60|$|My way {{lay over}} Mouter's Hill, and through {{an end of}} a clachan on the braeside among fields. There was a whir of looms in it went from house to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the {{neighbours}} that I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that this was Picardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen Company. Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a little beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains. They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them, the chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried. The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my fears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort. And as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what should I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it, and nodded, and talked aloud to herself, with becks and courtesies.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1999 {{interview}} at Diné College {{with a staff}} writer with the Indian Country Today, Sainte-Marie said [...] "I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> 10 years <b>later,</b> in the 1980s, that President Lyndon B.

50|$|As {{explained}} on her 2008 summer {{tour with}} John Mayer, {{there is a}} story behind this song. Caillat, Jason Reeves, and his roommate were a close group of three friends.

60|$|So {{much for}} that; and {{now about the}} kite. The letter Father had just {{received}} was from his sister, our Aunt Esther {{and the mother of}} Dick and Mimi. She was living at a place hundreds of miles inland. Her husband was dead and, as we <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later,</b> although she did not say a word about it in the letter, she was very poor. One day when Dick and Mimi were out in the woods looking for botany specimens they saw something funny in the top of a tree. Dick climbed up and got it. It was a big red kite with a patch on each side and names written on it. They carried it home to their mother. Dick has since told us that she turned as pale as the dead when she saw our names on it. You see, Philippa was her mother's name and Claude was her father's. And when she read the letter that was pasted over the hole in the kite she knew who we must be, for it was the very letter she had written to her brother so long ago. So she sat right down and wrote again, and this was the letter Jake Wiggins brought to the Big Half Moon. It was a beautiful letter. I loved Aunt Esther before I ever saw her, just from that letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "We girls," [...] she continued, [...] "went back to school, {{and just}} at that time Louise's brother came over to Brussels. I think that I have already told you that the {{supervision}} over us was far from strict. There was nothing to prevent Captain Fitzmaurice being a good deal with us. We had picnics, tennis parties, rides! Long before the six months were up I understood how foolish I had been. I wrote to Prince Frederick and begged him to release me from our uncompleted engagement. His answer was to appear in person. He made a scene. My {{mother and father were}} now wholly on his side. Within a few weeks he had lost both a cousin and a brother. His succession to the throne was almost a certainty. His own people were just as anxious to have him married. I did not know why then, but I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> on. They had their way. I believe that things are different in an English home. In mine, I can assure you that I never had any chance. I entered upon my married life without the least possibility of happiness. Needless to say, I never realized any! For the last four years my husband has been trying for a divorce! Very soon it is possible that he will succeed." ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{antagonist}} of the story, {{though it}} is <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>later</b> in the series. Aoi strives to destroy all of the trio's efforts, relishing the power of destroying someone's life and making others miserable. Because Kotani considers Aoi to be her first friend, nobody suspected her intentions until Kiritani <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> <b>Later</b> on, Aoi learns an important lesson about friendship and redemption, and is {{given a chance to}} turn over a new leaf at Kotani's grace.|$|E
5000|$|Though she was {{prominently}} featured, {{usually in}} a positive light, in the Laredo Morning Times, she once disputed two articles in the paper and withheld two city advertisements to make her point to newspaper executives.

50|$|On September 27, 1994, one of Quinn's doubles talks {{back at the}} boss, Mr. Hurley, {{and gets}} Quinn fired. He also kisses Wade. Hurley and Wade don't {{know that this was}} a double and thought it was the same Quinn they knew. Wade <b>found</b> this <b>out</b> <b>later</b> that day when Quinn invited both her and Professor Maximillian Arturo to his house to show them the sliding {{technology}} (technology to travel between parallel universes). Quinn, Wade, and Arturo all went sliding, and Rembrandt Brown, who happened to be traveling in the area was accidentally pulled into the vortex. For years, the Sliders continued to slide to different dimensions trying to find their way home..|$|R
25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained {{at home with their}} parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only <b>found</b> <b>out</b> much <b>later</b> in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This makes it difficult for older care leavers to find out why and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|R
