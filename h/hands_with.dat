Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
5|$|In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted part of {{the island}} to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the {{remainder}} being owned by the monks of Paisley.

This prize was by no means without its hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.|$|E
5000|$|Each player uses {{both hands}} to play the game, the number of digits {{extended}} on a hand showing the number of points that the hand has. Both start <b>with</b> each <b>hand</b> having one point [...] - [...] one finger extended on each hand. The goal {{of the game is}} for a player to force their opponent to extend all of their fingers and thumbs on both <b>hands.</b> A <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> all fingers and its thumb extended is called a dead hand and is taken out of play. (In another variation, the score has to be exactly five, and if the resulting number is more than five, five is subtracted from it, and the resulting number is displayed on the hand. For example, if a <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> 4 points is tapped by a <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> 2 points, the <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> 4 points becomes a <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> 1 point. This rule is called a 'roll over'.) ...|$|R

Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E

5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E

25|$|A solid bullet {{represents}} flexing {{the middle}} joint of a finger or fingers, and a hollow bullet represents straightening a flexed finger.

If the fingers are already flexed, then a solid bullet shows that they squeeze. For example, a square (closed fist, 'S' <b>hand)</b> <b>with</b> double solid bullets is the sign for 'milk' (iconically squeezing an udder).|$|R
