5000|$|One study, using {{relevant}} {{life history}} {{data from the}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes) predicts that a transgene introduced into a natural population by {{a small number of}} transgenic fish will spread as a result of enhanced mating advantage, but the reduced viability of offspring will cause eventual local extinction of both populations. GM coho salmon show greater risk-taking behaviour and better use of limited food than wild-type fish. Transgenic coho salmon have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in a considerably larger body size (>7-fold) compared to non-transgenic salmon. When transgenic and non-transgenic salmon in the same enclosure compete for different levels of food, transgenic individuals consistently outgrow non-transgenic individuals. When food abundance is low, dominant individuals emerge, invariably transgenic, that show strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominate the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability is low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experience population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only non-transgenic salmon have good (72%) survival rates. [...] This has led to the suggestion that these GM fish will survive better than the wild-type when conditions are very poor.|$|E

Growth, gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), reproductive success, induction potency of vitellogenin (VTG) in male fish and that of 7 -ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity (EROD) in male fish liver were used as test endpoints. The growth suppression of fish was observed in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in significant differences in both body length and body weight of medaka above 5 % effluent. This effluent can inhibit the growth of gonad of medakas and are more sensitive to male than to female. At exposure concentration of 40 % and higher, there was an unexpected decrease of HSI values, which may be resulted from sub-lethal toxicity of effluent to fish liver. VTG of plasma in males were induced in all exposure concentration levels, but not in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of 5 % effluent would be the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) affecting reproductive success when examining fertile individuals, fecundity and fertilization rate.

The <b>Japanese</b> rice fish, <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes), was used as the experimental model in which individual eggs were exposed via microinjection to various known concentrations of PbTx- 3 dissolved in an oil vehicle. Embryos injected with doses exceeding 1. 0 ng/egg displayed tachycardia, hyperkinetic twitches in the form of sustained convulsions, spinal curvature, clumping of the erythrocytes, and decreased hatching success. Furthermore, fish dosed with toxin were often unable to hatch in the classic tail-first fashion and emerged head first, which resulted in partial hatches and death. We determined that the LD 50 (dose that is lethal to 50 % of the fish) for an injected dose of PbTx- 3 is 4. 0 ng/egg. The results of this study complement previous studies of the developmental toxicity of the type A brevetoxin brevetoxin- 1 (PbTx- 1), by illustrating in vivo the differing affinities of the two congeners for cardiac sodium channels.

This procedure was undertaken with an artificial sediment in order to limit natural sediment variability. A suitable sediment composition might be then validated for zebrafish and proposed in a new OECD guideline for chemicals testing. Second, a comparative study of toxicity responses from this exposure protocol was then performed using another OECD species, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka.</b> The potential toxicity of both PAHs was assessed through lethal (e. g., survival, hatching success) and sublethal endpoints (e. g., abnormalities, PMR, and EROD) measured at different developmental stages, adapted to the embryonic development time of both species. Regarding effects observed for both species, a suitable artificial sediment composition for PAH toxicity testing was set at 92. 5 % dry weight (dw) silica of 0. 2 - 0. 5 -mm grain size, 5 % dw kaolin clay without organic matter for zebrafish, and 2. 5 % dw blond peat in more only for <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka.</b> PAH bioavailability and toxicity were highly dependent on the fraction of organic matter in sediment and of the K (ow) coefficients of the tested compounds. The biological responses observed were also dependent of the species under consideration. <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> embryos appeared more robust than zebrafish embryos for understanding the toxicity of PAHs following a sediment contact test, due to the longer exposure duration and lower sensitivity of sediment physical properties...|$|E

Upon comparing the early embryonic stages of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-recommended species, such as the fathead minnow and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka,</b> zebrafish appeared to be the best model for routine embryo toxicity testing, and the zebrafish embryo assay is a promising tool to replace the acute fish toxicity test [26, 27].|$|E

We also need animal experiments that can apply to human models and help prevent or solve the health issues we face in space travel. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes) is a suitable model fish for studying space adaptation as evidenced by adults of the species having mated successfully in space during 15 days of flight during the second Inter-national Microgravity Laboratory mission in 1994. The eggs laid by the fish developed nor-mally and hatched as juveniles in space. In 2012, another space experiment (“Medaka Osteoclast”) was conducted. Six-week-old male and female <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Cab strain osteoblast transgenic fish) were maintained in the Aquatic Habitat system for two months in the ISS.

40|$|In {{the genus}} Oryzias, the morphologies of the dorsal and anal fins are typical {{secondary}} sex characters. In the <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes) and Thai medaka (Oryzias minutillus), androgen receptor (AR) expression {{levels in the}} dorsal, anal, and pectoral fins were higher in males than in females. Conversely, in both species estrogen receptor (ER) β expression levels in the dorsal and anal fins were higher in females than in males. AR and ERβ expression levels in the dorsal and anal fins of sex-undeterminable individuals of Thai medaka were intermediate between those in normal male and female Thai medaka. There {{was no difference in}} the bone morphogenic protein (Bmp) 2 b expression level between male and female <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka.</b> In contrast, the Bmp 2 b expression level in the dorsal fin of sex-undeterminable individuals was lower than in normal male and female Thai medaka. It is thus clear that androgen and estrogen regulate the sex-dependent characters of fin morphology in both Oryzias species. In sex-undeterminable individuals of Thai medaka, the low levels of Bmp 2 b expression in the dorsal fin are evidence that androgen and estrogen are necessary for adequate expression of Bmp 2 b in the normal development of at least the dorsal fin. © 2009 Zoological Society of Japan. 全文公開 20100...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the accuracy of}} fuzzy habitat preference models (FHPMs) and habitat preference curves (HPCs) obtained from the FHPMs {{in order to assess}} the effect of two types of data [log-transformed fish population density (LOG) and presence-absence (P/A) data] on the habitat preference evaluation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes). Three independent data sets were prepared for each type of data. The results differed according to the data sets and the types of data used. The HPCs showed a similar trend, whilst the degrees of preference were different. The model accuracy also differed according to the data sets used. Although almost no statistical difference was observed, on average, the P/A-based models showed a better performance according to the threshold-independent performance measures, whilst the LOG-based models showed better performance in predicting absence of the fish. These results can be explained partly from the different shapes of HPCs. This case study of <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> demonstrated the effect of different types of data on habitat preference evaluation. Further studies should build on the present finding and evaluate the effects of data characteristics such as the size of data sets and the prevalence for better understanding and reliable assessment of the habitat for target species...|$|E
40|$|The oil sands, {{located in}} {{north-eastern}} Alberta, {{are one of}} the largest deposits of oil worldwide. Because the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act prohibits the release of oil sands process-affected material into the environment, industry is storing vast quantities of tailings on mine lease sites. The oil sands industry is currently accumulating tailings waste at a rate of > 105 m 3 /day, for which reclamation strategies are being investigated. Naphthenic acids (NAs) have been identified as the most toxic component of oil sands tailings as they are considered acutely toxic to a variety of biota, and are therefore a target contaminant for tailings pond reclamation strategies. Current literature based on Microtox® assays (marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri) suggests that lower molecular weight NAs are more toxic than higher molecular weight NAs. The following thesis involves the utilization of NA fractions and their relative toxicities to determine if NA toxicity is related to NA molecular weight. A previous study generated an oil sands-derived naphthenic acid extract (NAE), which was fractionated by distillation at stepped temperatures, yielding five fractions with increasing median molecular weights (Daltons). In the present study, the same extract and five fractions were utilized. To expand on the earlier characterization which involved a low resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), the whole extract and five fractions were analysed using electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS). Mean molecular weights were generated for each fraction, and an increase in molecular weight with increasing fraction number was confirmed. Respective mean Daltons and relative proportions for each fraction are as follows: 237 and 11. 9 % (fraction 1), 240 and 32. 3 % (fraction 2), 257 and 33. 4 % (fraction 3), 308 and 16. 8 % (fraction 4), and 355 and 5. 6 % (fraction 5). When chemical analyses of fractions were compared, it was determined that structures contributing to increased molecular weight included increased cyclic structures (up to 7 -ring structures), aromaticity (mono- and diaromatics), nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen heteroatoms, and dihydroxy/dicarboxy compounds. In addition, characterization data suggested the presence of NAs exhibiting estrogenic structures. 	Following chemical characterization, NA fractions were subject to embryo/larval bioassays using two fish species: Oryzias latipes (<b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka)</b> and Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow). Endpoints evaluated were mortality, time to hatch, hatch length, and abnormalities. Results suggest that relative NA fraction toxicity is not related to molecular weight, as no trend relating mean Dalton weight to toxicity was observed for any endpoint in both species. Acute toxicity data indicated differences between fractions as high as 2 -fold, although results were species-dependent. Fraction 1 displayed the lowest potency (highest LC 50) for both <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (0. 291 mM) and fathead minnow (0. 159 mM). Fractions 3 and 2 for <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (0. 149 and 0. 157 mM, respectively), and fractions 5 and 2 for fathead minnow (0. 061 and 0. 080 mM, respectively) displayed the greatest potencies for mortality (lowest LC 50). When fraction LC 50 s for <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> were compared to the whole NAE (0. 143 mM), the mid molecular weight fractions (fractions 2 and 3) appeared most similar to the whole NA.. In terms of relative toxicity and proportion, constituents in the mid molecular range fractions (2 and 3) likely represent greater risk compared to other fractions, and further chemical and toxicological characterization of constituents within these fractions is warranted particularly for long-chained, monocarboxylic acids, with low aromaticity. 	 	<b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> and fathead minnow varied in their sensitivity and their relative response to different fractions. In general, fathead minnow were more sensitive than <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> based on lower estimates of LC 50 and threshold (growth) values in addition to the presence of developmental abnormalities (predominately yolk sac edema) associated with a few of the fractions. Compared to differences in toxicity between fractions for a given species (> 2 -fold for fathead minnow), there was more variability between species for a given fraction (> 3 -fold for fraction 5). Also, the relative toxicity of fractions as indicated in the present study is contrary to the results generated using Vibrio fischeri for the same fractions. Thus, {{there is a need for}} multi- endpoint and species toxicity evaluations to assess the efficacy of remediation and reclamation options for reducing toxicity of oil sands tailings...|$|E

40|$|In aquatic environments, {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) mostly occur as complex mixtures, for which risk assessment remains problematic. To better understand the effects of PAH mixture toxicity on fish early life stages, this study compared the developmental toxicity of three PAH complex mixtures. These mixtures were extracted from a PAH-contaminated sediment (Seine estuary, France) and two oils (Arabian Light and Erika). For each fraction, artificial sediment was spiked at three different environmental concentrations roughly equivalent to 0. 5, 4, and 10 μg total PAH g− 1 dw. <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> embryos were incubated on these PAH-spiked sediments throughout their development, right up until hatching. Several endpoints were recorded at different developmental stages, including acute endpoints, morphological abnormalities, larvae locomotion, and genotoxicity (comet and micronucleus assays). The three PAH fractions delayed hatching, induced developmental abnormalities, disrupted larvae swimming activity, and damaged DNA at environmental concentrations. Differences in toxicity levels, likely related to differences in PAH proportions, were highlighted between fractions. The Arabian Light and Erika petrogenic fractions, containing {{a high proportion of}} alkylated PAHs and low molecular weight PAHs, were more toxic to <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> early life stages than the pyrolytic fraction. This was not supported by the toxic equivalency approach, which appeared unsuitable for assessing the toxicity of the three PAH fractions to fish early life stages.

40|$|In this study, the {{biologic}} {{effects of}} DES {{on the early}} life and adult life stages of <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes) were evaluated. At the early life stage, the fertilized eggs were exposed to 1 - 1000 ng/L diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 15 days and the hatched larvae were continually exposed to the same concentrations for an additional 25 days. Significant adverse effects on hatchability, time to hatching and mortality rate occurred at DES concentrations of 100 and 1000 ng/L, while the abnormality (scoliosis and abdominal swelling) rate was significantly increased at 10 ng/L and above. After exposure, the fish were maintained in charcoal-dechlorinated tap water for a further 30 days. Only the male gonadosomatic index (GSI) at 1000 ng/L was significantly increased. At concentrations greater than 1 ng/L, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) mRNA in both sexes and vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) mRNA in males were significantly down-regulated; while Vtg-I mRNA in females was significantly up-regulated. When sexually mature medaka were exposed to 10 and 1000 ng/L DES for 21 days, only the GSI in females was significantly decreased at 1000 ng/L. At 10 and 1000 ng/L, ER alpha mRNA in both sexes was significantly down-regulated, while Vtg-I mRNA in males was significantly up-regulated. These findings showed that DES at the environmental concentration of 10 ng/L can affect the early life stage development of medaka and alter liver ER alpha and Vtg-I gene expression. Therefore, if we only focused on these sensitive toxicity endpoints such as ER alpha and Vtg-I mRNA expression, DES has a strong estrogenic effect on <b>Japanese</b> <b>medaka...</b>|$|E
