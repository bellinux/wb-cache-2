5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for <b>exchange</b> rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed <b>exchange</b> rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the <b>Exchange</b> Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing <b>exchange</b> rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an <b>exchange</b> rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign <b>exchange</b> market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the <b>exchange</b> rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for <b>exchange</b> rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central <b>exchange</b> rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign <b>exchange</b> market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the <b>exchange</b> rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign <b>exchange</b> risk (unanticipated changes in <b>exchange</b> rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) <b>exchange</b> rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future <b>exchange</b> rates: the forward <b>exchange</b> rate and the future spot <b>exchange</b> rate.|$|E

5|$|The forward <b>exchange</b> rate (also {{referred}} to as forward rate or forward price) is the <b>exchange</b> rate at which a bank agrees to <b>exchange</b> one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The forward <b>exchange</b> rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot <b>exchange</b> rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign <b>exchange</b> market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward <b>exchange</b> rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot <b>exchange</b> rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

5|$|The forward <b>exchange</b> rate is {{the rate}} at which a {{commercial}} bank is willing to commit to <b>exchange</b> one currency for another at some specified future date. The forward <b>exchange</b> rate is a type of forward price. It is the <b>exchange</b> rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign <b>exchange</b> risk by using a forward contract to lock in a forward <b>exchange</b> rate. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an <b>exchange.</b> Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{the implications of}} demutualization of financial <b>exchanges</b> for their roles as self-regulatory organizations. Many regulators and <b>exchanges</b> believe that conflicts of interest increase when <b>exchanges</b> convert to for-profit businesses. Demutualization also changes the nature of an <b>exchange's</b> regulatory role as broker-dealers'ownership interests are reduced. These factors are leading to reduced regulatory roles for <b>exchanges</b> in many jurisdictions. The resulting changes have significant implications for regulation of financial markets, especially as <b>exchanges</b> are the only self-regulating organizations (SROs) in most countries. Major changes {{in the role of}} <b>exchanges</b> require a rethinking of the allocation of regulatory functions and the role of self-regulation, as well as stronger mechanisms to mitigate conflicts of interest. Carson looks at the views of both <b>exchanges</b> and regulators on these issues in Asian, European, and North American jurisdictions where major <b>exchanges</b> have converted to for-profit businesses. He finds that views on the conflicts of interest faced by demutualized <b>exchanges</b> vary widely. In addition, the tools and processes used by <b>exchanges</b> and regulators to manage conflicts also differ significantly across jurisdictions. The author concludes that new and greater conflicts result from demutualization and canvasses the regulatory responses in the jurisdictions examined.
