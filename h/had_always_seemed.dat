60|$|The {{battle of}} the clans on the North Inch of Perth <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to him a master-stroke of diplomacy.|$|E
60|$|James {{was sitting}} next to Mrs. Clibborn, and {{presently}} she looked at him with the melancholy smile which <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to her so effective.|$|E
60|$|Until tonight, therefore, as I say, I {{had never}} {{questioned}} {{the accuracy of}} the statement. Scorned women first and the rest nowhere, was how it <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me.|$|E
60|$|A silly {{process it}} <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me, though many find it diverting.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me," [...] muttered the hunter, {{as well as}} a large {{mouthful of}} the prairie hen would permit--for he was fond of muttering his {{thoughts}} when alone; it felt more sociable, you see, than merely thinking them--"It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that contentment is a grand thing for the human race. Pity we hasn't all got it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{watching}} me, and often {{there was such a}} wistful look in them--it reminded me of the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara looked up. [...] "Oh yes," [...] {{she said}} vaguely. [...] "Alessi. I know." [...] Alessi: Aleppo--where a {{malignant}} and a turbaned Turk. And a turbaned; that <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to her very funny.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} {{replaced}} the chair. And suddenly {{a wave of}} pity passed over her for the dead woman, who <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> so lonely in the great stiffly-furnished house, and the tears came.|$|E
60|$|This was surprising, for Belforest <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> as free as the turnpike-road, and River Hollow was {{apparently}} {{part of the}} estate, {{but there was an}} air of discouraging questions, so Carey suspected quarrels and asked none.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{surprise}} me," [...] said Mr. Brinsmade. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> inoffensive, and I {{believe he}} is a prominent {{member of one of}} our churches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, cousin. The {{blood and}} name of Wallingford are very {{near and dear to}} me, and Clawbonny <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> {{a sort of}} home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Countess {{is a very}} charming, a very beautiful, and a most {{attractive}} woman," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Her marriage <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me a matter of certainty." ...|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{observed}} that the countenance of her husband grew grave, at these allusions to an event he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to wish forgotten; and she interposed {{with a view to}} lead the minds of those who listened, back to matter more fitting to be discussed.|$|E
60|$|I grinned; but Perry {{was quite}} serious about it. It <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> rather {{more or less}} of a joke to me that I should be {{addressed}} as majesty {{and all the rest}} of it. Yet my imperial power and dignity had been a very real thing during my brief reign.|$|E
6000|$|Jessie had not {{grown so}} wise {{as not to}} be nettled at this silly impertinent speech, but she was much more vexed to see that Florence was {{teaching}} Amy her own follies--Amy, who <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> like a pure little innocent wild rose-bud in its modest green leaves. So she answered, rather shortly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] remarked Ned, as they {{resumed their}} journey {{at a slow}} pace, [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that cities are unnatural monstrosities, and {{that there should be}} no such things!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To me her eyes, Lieutenant Muir, <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> {{winning and}} soft, though I will {{acknowledge}} that they sometimes laugh; yes, I have known them to laugh, and that right heartily, and with downright goodwill." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{did not see}} the Bible, I dreamed it. Ever {{since early}} childhood, I have been captivated by the Bible. It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me and still seems today the {{greatest}} source of poetry of all time.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the grey}} trouble passed from his mind; {{he saw the}} world full of colour again. He saw the scene he desired bright and clear, saw Ethel no longer bitter and weeping, but glad as once she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> glad. His heart-beats quickened. It was giving had been needed, and he would give.|$|E
6000|$|Paul saw {{the smoke}} of Mrs. King's chimney. That <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> like a friend to him, but it came across him that they too thought him a runaway from prison, and {{he felt as if}} his only bond of {{fellowship}} was gone. But there was something else, too; and he made answer, 'I'll bide for the Confirmation.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had always}} lived alone with Hester. I did not {{remember}} our parents, {{who had died in}} my babyhood. Hester was fifteen years older than I, and she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> more like a mother than a sister. She had been very good to me and had never denied me anything I wanted, save the one thing that mattered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I?" [...] said Susan. [...] "I {{think of}} it very often. It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> much more like home to me than our house in New York, and I love it better than any spot I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But they surely {{could never}} be so wicked as that, papa. They <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to like me--not very much, you know, because they thought I wasn't quiet and ladylike enough. Still I don't think they really disliked me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} that noble ladies are not {{suffered}} to see those to whom {{they are to be}} wedded, Signora, if that is what your eccellenza means, and, to me, the custom <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> unjust, if not cruel." ...|$|R
60|$|However much he had {{secretly}} disapproved of {{her from the}} beginning, because she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to him such an uncomfortable and tantalising person, Stephen was impressed that night by the haunting unhappiness of Bianca's face; {{as if it had}} been suddenly disclosed to him that she could not help herself. This was disconcerting, being, in a sense, a disorderly way of seeing things.|$|E
60|$|Shefford, {{even in his}} agitation, {{felt the}} Mormon's silence to be a consent that need not have been asked. And Shefford had a passionate gratefulness toward his comrade. That stultifying and {{blinding}} prejudice which <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to remove a Mormon outside the pale of certain virtue suffered final eclipse; and Joe Lake stood out a man, strange and crude, but with a heart and a soul.|$|E
60|$|And {{now through}} waters so brightly blue and {{transparent}} that they aroused the girls' wonder and admiration, the good ship plowed her {{way toward the}} port of Naples, passing {{to the east of}} Sardinia and Corsica, which they viewed with eager interest because these places <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> so far away to them, and had now suddenly appeared as if by magic directly before their eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "To me it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> strange, Bourdon, {{that one}} of your kind {{feelings}} should ever wish to live alone, at all; yet I have heard you say that a love of solitude first drew you to your trade." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I have {{to admit}} that, among the {{conservative}} figures I monitor professionally, you <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> something of an anomaly {{to the extent that}} you seem genuinely considerate and interested in dialogue with those with whom you disagree,” Mantyla recently wrote to the pastor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm more {{surprised}} at Mr. Sinclair {{than at the}} elders," [...] said Mrs. Abner Keech, fanning herself vigorously. [...] "Elders are subject to queer spells periodically. They think they assert their authority that way. But Mr. Sinclair <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> so liberal and broad-minded." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{have never}} felt {{anything}} of this nature about Tuppy and Angela. Tuppy, when not making an ass of himself, is a soundish sort of egg. So is Angela a soundish sort of egg. And, {{as far as being}} in love was concerned, it <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that you wouldn't have been far out in describing them as two hearts that beat as one.|$|E
60|$|Malloring got up {{from the}} sill. This was 'laisser-faire' with a vengeance! Such {{philosophy}} <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to him to savor dangerously of anarchism. And yet twenty years' experience as a neighbor had shown him that Tod was in himself perhaps the most harmless person in Worcestershire, and held in a curious esteem by most of the people about. He was puzzled, and sat down again.|$|E
60|$|The {{world of}} art seemed so secure and reposeful, {{so filled with}} splendor of human endeavor. She drew her breath in a mighty inspiration, and {{resolved}} {{to be a part}} of it. Art <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to her so far off, something European, and now she seemed to be in immediate contact with it, and soared into exultation for a day, falling soon into dreary doubt.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me," [...] said Meta, [...] "that few lives {{could come}} up to Dr. May's. Think of going about, always watched for with hope, often {{bringing}} gladness and relief; if nothing else, comfort and kindness, his whole business doing good." ...|$|R
5000|$|The play, {{prior to}} the squeeze card, of the winner that blocks South's threat is called the Vienna coup. The term has long been {{regarded}} as unduly connoting brilliance: [...] "In short, the aura of glamor which <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to surround this play is wholly fictitious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} you have done right?" [...] she asked. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me from what I know and have heard of you that you were made for {{positions}} of trust. You {{would have been a}} better governor than the man they have nominated." ...|$|R
