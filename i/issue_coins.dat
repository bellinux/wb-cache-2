Over 7000 inscriptions (Shilashasana) including 300 copper plate inscriptions (Tamarashasana) have been recovered, almost half {{of which are in}} Kannada, the remaining in Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit. Bilingual inscriptions had lost favour by the 14th century. The empire minted coins at Hampi, Penugonda and Tirupati with Nagari, Kannada and Telugu legends usually carrying the name of the ruler. Gold, silver and copper were used to <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> called Gadyana, Varaha, Pon, Pagoda, Pratapa, Pana, Kasu and Jital. The coins contained the images of various gods including Balakrishna (infant Krishna), Venkateshwara (the presiding deity of the temple at Tirupati), goddesses such as Bhudevi and Sridevi, divine couples, animals such as bulls and elephants and birds. The earliest coins feature Hanuman and Garuda (divine eagle), the vehicle of Lord Vishnu.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Coinage Act 1926, the Finance Minister was {{authorised}} to <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> of silver, nickel, and bronze of the same denominations as the British coins already in circulation – however the Irish silver coins were to contain 75% silver as compared to the 50% silver coins issued by Britain at the time.

25|$|According to Suetonius, Britannicus {{was good}} friends with the future Emperor Titus, whose father Vespasian had {{commanded}} legions in Britain. As part of the Flavians' attempts to link themselves with the Julio-Claudians, Titus claimed {{that he had been}} seated with Britannicus on the night he was killed. He even claimed to have tasted the poison, which resulted in a serious and long illness. Titus would go on to erect a gold statue of his friend, and <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> in his memory.|$|E
25|$|In 262, {{the mint}} in Alexandria started to again <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> for Gallienus, demonstrating that Egypt had {{returned}} to his control after suppressing the revolt of the Macriani. In spring of 262, the city was wrenched by civil unrest {{as a result of}} a new revolt. The rebel this time was the prefect of Egypt, Lucius Mussius Aemilianus, who had already given support to the revolt of the Macriani. The correspondence of bishop Dionysius of Alexandria provides a commentary on the background of invasion, civil war, plague, and famine that characterized this age.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} {{of being a}} small population and with Belgian coins so abundantly circulating in Luxembourg meant it was seldom necessary for Luxembourg to issue coinage on a year by year basis, especially in later years during design changes when large numbers of coins were minted in Brussels to supply the small country for many years at a time. As a result, some dates appear in mint sets only while many other dates saw no standard <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> minted at all. Many earlier dates changed frequently with larger denominations often being single year designs.|$|E

Being {{the father of the}} monarch, Brajanath Gohain exercised the virtual powers of a sovereign. He appointed himself as Charing Raja and Juvaraj or heir apparent. He also issued coins and grants lands to Brahmins in his own name, though it was the privilege of the king who could <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> in his own name and also perform land grants to Brahmins.|$|E
25|$|The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh {{as well as}} Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The {{territory}} of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline. They {{are known for their}} patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India. They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect a huge part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.|$|E
25|$|Its {{early history}} {{reveals that the}} {{maritime}} importance of the island dates back to pre-Dorian times. It is usually stated on the authority of Ephorus, that Pheidon of Argos established a mint in Aegina, the first city-state to <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> in Europe, the Aeginetic stater. One stamped stater (having the mark of some authority {{in the form of}} a picture or words) can be seen in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris. It is an electrum stater of a turtle, an animal sacred to Aphrodite, struck at Aegina that dates from 700 BC. Therefore, it is thought that the Aeginetes, within 30 or 40years of the invention of coinage in Asia Minor by the Ionian Greeks or the Lydians (c. 630 BC), might have been the ones to introduce coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island. The Aeginetic weight standard of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic stater was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the Peloponnesian War, 404 BC, it was replaced by the land tortoise.|$|E

500|$|In 1638, {{the reins}} of power fell {{into the hands of}} the 23-year-old Kanthirava Narasaraja I, who, a few months earlier, had been adopted by the widow of Raja I. Kanthirava was the first wodeyar of Mysore to create the symbols of royalty, such as a royal mint, and went on to <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> named Kanthiraya (corrupted to [...] "Canteroy") after himself. These {{remained}} a part of Mysore's [...] "current national money" [...] well into the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|In East Anglia, Beonna {{probably}} became king {{in about}} 758. Beonna's first coinage predates Offa's own, and implies independence from Mercia. Subsequent East Anglian history is quite obscure, but in 779 Æthelberht II became king, and was independent {{long enough to}} <b>issue</b> <b>coins</b> of his own. In 794, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, [...] "King Offa ordered King Æthelberht's head to be struck off". Offa minted pennies in East Anglia in the early 790s, so {{it is likely that}} Æthelberht rebelled against Offa and was beheaded as a result. Accounts of the event have survived in which Aethelberht is killed through the machinations of Offa's wife Cynethryth, but the earliest manuscripts in which these possibly legendary accounts are found date from the 11th and 12th centuries, and recent historians do not regard them with confidence. The legend also claims that Æthelberht was killed at Sutton St. Michael and buried four miles (6km) to the south at Hereford, where his cult flourished, becoming at one time second only to Canterbury as a pilgrimage destination.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Aksum's minting of currency, the state already had a long trade history with Greece, Rome, the Persian Empire, and India. That coinage began so late {{is in fact a}} little surprising. The late use of coinage may be {{attributed}} to the lack of a developed economy, required for coinage to be accepted. Most Aksumite coins were found in the large trade centres with very few in remote villages, where trade would be more through barter and not coinage based. In fact, the motivation for Aksum's initial minting of coins was for foreign trade and markets, as evidenced by the use of Greek on most of its coins. Moreover, gold coins seem to have been intended primarily for external trade, while copper and silver coins probably mainly circulated within the Aksumite empire, as the gold issues generally specified [...] "king of the Aksumites" [...] as title of the Aksumite king, whereas the title of silver and copper issues generally only read [...] "king." [...] International use of Aksumite coins seems to have begun early on, as coins of King Ezana and even of King Aphilas (the second Aksumite ruler to <b>issue</b> <b>coins)</b> have been found in India.|$|E
