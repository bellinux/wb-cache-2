5|$|Dielectric barrier <b>discharge</b> (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal <b>discharge</b> {{generated}} by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma <b>discharge</b> into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' <b>discharge</b> in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the <b>discharge</b> to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier <b>discharge</b> {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of peripheral and central synaptic input to non-spontaneous, irregular <b>discharging</b> and regular <b>discharging</b> neurones in the inferior mesenteric ganglion {{of the cat}} were studied in vitro using intracellular recording techniques. All three types of neurones in rostral and caudal lobes received central synaptic input primarily from L 3 and L 4 spinal cord segments. Since irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones received synaptic input from intraganglionic regular <b>discharging</b> neurones, some of the central input to irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones may have been relayed through the regular <b>discharging</b> neurones. In the rostral lobes of the ganglion, more than 70 % of the non-spontaneous and irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones tested received peripheral synaptic input from the lumbar colonic, intermesenteric and left and right hypogastric nerves. Most of the regular <b>discharging</b> neurones tested received synaptic input from the intermesenteric and lumbar colonic nerves; none of the regular <b>discharging</b> neurones received synaptic input from the hypogastric nerves. Some of the peripheral synaptic input from the lumbar colonic and intermesenteric nerves to irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones may have been relayed through the regular <b>discharging</b> neurones. Axons of non-spontaneous and irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones located in the rostral lobes travelled to the periphery exclusively in the lumbar colonic nerves. Antidromic responses were not observed in regular <b>discharging</b> neurones during stimulation {{of any of the}} major peripheral nerve trunks. This suggests these neurones were intraganglionic. In the caudal lobes, irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones received a similar pattern of peripheral synaptic input as did irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones located in the rostral lobes. The majority of irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones in the caudal lobes projected their axons to the periphery through the lumbar colonic nerves. Non-spontaneous neurones in the caudal lobes, in contrast to those located in the rostral lobes, received peripheral synaptic input primarily from the hypogastric nerves. Axons of the majority of non-spontaneous neurones located in the caudal lobes travelled to the periphery through hypogastric nerves. The results suggest that non-spontaneous neurones and irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones in the rostral lobes and the majority of irregular <b>discharging</b> neurones in the caudal lobes transact and integrate neural commands destined for abdominal viscera supplied by the lumbar colonic nerves.

50|$|Most commonly, <b>discharging</b> {{is applied}} to planar graphs.Initially, a charge is {{assigned}} to each face and each vertex of the graph.The charges are assigned so that they sum to a small positive number. During the <b>Discharging</b> Phase the charge at each face or vertex may be redistributed to nearby faces and vertices, as required {{by a set of}} <b>discharging</b> rules. However, each <b>discharging</b> rule maintains the sum of the charges. The rules are designed so that after the <b>discharging</b> phase each face or vertex with positive charge lies in one of the desired subgraphs. Since the sum of the charges is positive, some face or vertex must have a positive charge.
