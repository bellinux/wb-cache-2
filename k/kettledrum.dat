The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed on top of a <b>kettledrum.</b> Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E
25|$|Each item of kleinody {{was granted}} to a clearly {{assigned}} member of cossack starshina (officership). For example, in Zaporizhian Host bulawa {{was given to}} the otaman; khoruhva - to the whole host although carried by a khorunzhy; bunchuk also was given to otaman, but carried by a bunchuzhny or bunchuk comrade; the seal was preserved by a military judge, while seals of kurin - to kurin otaman and seals of palanka - to colonel of a certain palanka; kettledrums were in possession of a dovbysh (drummer); staffs - to a military osavul; badges were given to all 38 kurins in possession to the assigned badge comrades. All items of kleinody except of <b>kettledrum</b> sticks were stored in the Sich's Pokrova church treasury and were taking out only on a special order of kish otaman. The <b>kettledrum</b> sticks were kept in the kurin with the assigned dovbysh. Sometimes part of kleidony was considered a great silver inkwell (kalamar), an attribute of a military scribe (pysar) of the Zaporizhian Host. Similar kleinods had the officership of the Cossack Hetmanate, cossacks of Kuban, Danube, and other cossack societies.|$|E

For example, Rui de Pina refers to one instance in which King John II himself played the part of The Knight of the Swan in a production which included a scene constructed of fabric waves. During the action, a fleet of carracks with a crew of spectacularly dressed actors entered the room accompanied by the sound of minstrels, trumpets, <b>kettledrum,</b> and artillery.|$|E

500|$|... "Whipping Post" [...] (opening in 11/4 time, unusual {{territory}} for a rock band) {{by this point}} {{had become one of}} the longest jams in the band's set; the original album version runs five minutes, while the At Fillmore East version exceeds 23. Aside from the opening bassline and lyrics, the two versions are completely unalike. Again, Betts and Allman trade long guitar solos, with one of Betts' solos quoting what would later become the main theme for the song [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] as featured on the band's 1972 album Eat a Peach. [...] The song closes with [...] "long, sustained notes" [...] from Allman opposite Trucks' <b>kettledrum.</b> Applause concludes the album and the song fades out.

[...] Later in the Baroque era, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a secular cantata titled [...] "Tönet, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!", which translates roughly to [...] "Sound off, ye timpani!

Bach reworked this movement in part 1 of the Christmas Oratorio.|$|E

2500|$|The {{setting for}} the {{approximately}} 400 megalithic monuments convey {{the feeling of a}} ghost town. Their structures are varied in shape and size. There are clusters of dolmens, three sided chambers with capstones forming the roof. The small dolmens are , while the larger ones measure up to [...] height. The buried and semi-buried dolmens are categorized as cists and dolmenoid cists, and are arranged in circular layouts. [...] Most of them have collapsed. The dolmens with round portholes give the appearance of dwellings with windows but they are funerary structures. These dolmens flank both sides of the main street. Pit circles and oblong chambers covered with gable stone roofs have also been found. The dolmenoid cists are in several shapes and sizes. Those in an oblong shape are discerned to have been built with packing of rubble stones at the ground level. A circular enclosure is noted. Around these structures there is a pit filled with layers of earth. In rock shelters, there are paintings of people dancing, hunting, and holding weapons. There are also geometric and mystic designs of deer, peacocks, antelopes, humped bulls, horses and cows. An unusual find is a stone <b>kettledrum</b> on a [...] high boulder. The boulder is hemispherical in shape with a diameter of [...] and standing [...] in height. The boulder, when struck with a wooden hammer, produces sounds which are heard up to [...] away. In this area, the caves were either residences or places of worship; they contained cave paintings in red ocher colour which corroborates the existences of the funerary structures nearby.|$|E

60|$|The {{good woman}} {{was just going}} to make her tea. Viola insisted on showing the use of her cozy, and making {{everybody}} stay to nurse's impromptu <b>kettledrum,</b> and herself put in the pinches of tea. Dermot chaffed all and sundry; Viola bustled about; Harold sat on the dresser, with his blue eyes gleaming in the firelight with silent amusement and perfect satisfaction, the cat sitting on his shoulder; and nurse, who was firmly persuaded that he had rescued her dear Master Dermot from the fangs of the lion, was delighted to do her best for his entertainment. Viola insisted on displaying all the curiosities--the puzzle-cup that could not be used, the horrid frog that sprang to your lips in the tankard, the rolling-pin covered with sentimental poetry, and her extraordinary French pictures on the walls. Dermot kept us full of merriment, and we laughed on till the sound of the dressing-bell sent us racing up to the castle in joyous guilt.

60|$|It was kindled {{on a wide}} level plot in the {{outskirts}} of the settlement, around which the trees spread their sheltering arms. On a plank raised on two casks sat the blacksmith with his fiddle. The carpenter sat beside him with a <b>kettledrum,</b> more literally a <b>kettledrum</b> even than the real thing, for that drum was a kettle! On a little mound that rose in the centre of the plot sat, in state, Dick and Mary, March and the vision in leather, their respective thrones being empty flour-casks. Around them danced the youth and beauty of the settlement. These were enclosed by a dense circle, composed of patriarchal, middle-aged, and extremely juvenile admirers. The background of the picture was filled up with the monstrous fire which saturated that spot in the forest with light--bright as the broadest day. The extreme foreground was composed of the trunk of a fallen tree, on which sat our friend the artist, delineating the whole with the eagerness of an enthusiast who had at last fallen upon a scene truly worthy of his genius.|$|E

60|$|One cheerful {{evidence}} of the decivilization of the Anglo-Saxon race is the late tendency to return to first principles in art, as manifested in substituting noise for music. Herein we detect symptoms of a rapid relapse into original barbarism. The savage who beats his gong or <b>kettledrum</b> until his face is of a delicate blue, and his eyes assert themselves like those of an unterrified snail, believes that musical skill is a mere question of brawn-a matter of muscle. If not wholly ignorant of technical gymnastics, he has a theory that a deftness at dumb-bells is a prime requisite in a finished artist. The advance-in a circle-of civilization has only partially unsettled this belief in the human mind, and we are constantly though unconsciously reverting to it.|$|E
