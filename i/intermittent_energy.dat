40|$|Increase of {{the global}} energy demand and {{environmental}} problems relating to fossil energy utilization request the new energy sources to replace the traditional fossil fuels. With respect to energy production, most of the islands in European Union {{and in the other}} parts of the world, depend on importation, mainly from oil and its related products. The global development of renewable energy technologies can assure sustainable supply of power for islands. To overcome the limitation of the sources of renewable energy, hydrogen is utilized as a storage medium integrated with <b>intermittent</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources such as wind and solar.

25|$|Throughout the 1970s, the United States {{underwent}} a wrenching period of low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>energy</b> crises. By October 1978, Iran—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a major uprising that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil. In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country, Iranian opposition figure Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended his 14-year exile in France {{and returned to}} Iran to establish an Islamic Republic, largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country.

25|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} energy contend that nuclear power is a {{sustainable}} energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources. Proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gases and smog, {{in contrast to the}} chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Nuclear power can produce base-load power unlike many renewables which are <b>intermittent</b> <b>energy</b> sources lacking large-scale and cheap ways of storing energy. M. King Hubbert saw oil as a resource that would run out, and proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source. Proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} use for pumped storage {{has traditionally been}} to balance baseload powerplants, but may {{also be used to}} abate the fluctuating output of <b>intermittent</b> <b>energy</b> sources. Pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity. In certain jurisdictions, electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it; although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone, increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences. It is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation. Increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources. [...] The high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions [...] supplies 40% of annual output, but 60% may be reached before additional storage is necessary.|$|E
