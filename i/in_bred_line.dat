40|$|The {{acidification}} of oceans {{is predicted}} to fundamentally alter marine ecosystems. Previous {{studies have found that}} elevated CO 2 has an effect on adult calcification, fertilisation and larval development, perhaps because of the organisms' inability to regulate acid-base status, but {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that underlie such responses. This study investigated the growth response of larvae of a wild and selectively <b>bred</b> <b>line</b> of the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, to elevated CO 2 and measured the pattern of expression of proteins. Overall exposure to elevated CO 2 caused a significant reduction in the shell length of D-veliger larvae of the wild, but not <b>in</b> the selectively <b>bred</b> <b>line.</b> Prior to this study, differences in growth between selectively bred and wild oysters have only been found following settlement Proteome analysis of D-veliger larvae using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis detected a significantly greater number of protein spots <b>in</b> selectively <b>bred</b> compared to wild oyster lines. In addition, a comparison of the proteins expressed between selectively bred and wild larvae exposed to elevated CO 2 and ambient conditions showed that a number of proteins were up- or down-regulated and in some cases, switched on at elevated CO 2 <b>in</b> selectively <b>bred</b> <b>lines,</b> but not found in the wild lines.

We used experimental evolution to test for morphological adaptations associated with high voluntary wheel running <b>in</b> selectively <b>bred</b> <b>lines</b> of mice. Surprisingly, the classical indicators of cursoriality had not evolved in concert with high activity levels.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} changes in genetic {{diversity}} using two different methods <b>in</b> eight captive <b>bred</b> <b>lines</b> of banana shrimp (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) that had been mass selected for length for up to 14 generations. Specifically, mitochondrial D-loop DNA sequencing and genotyping using five DNA microsatellite loci were used to document changes in haplotype diversity and allelic diversity numbers at several time points during and up to 14 generations of captive <b>bred</b> <b>lines,</b> typically maintained without intercrossing among lines. Data from eight of the lines were compared {{with each other and}} to a reference sample of wild caught animals. As each wild animal had a unique mtDNA haplotype, we estimate there were 20 different mtDNA haplotypes in each of the two different founding stocks. The average number of haplotypes was 1. 8 after 11 or more generations of captive breeding. Similarly, whereas the wild reference stock had an average number of more than 13 microsatellite alleles per locus, the descendent lines had an average of 5. 6 per locus after 11 or more generations. These declines were evident despite strategies that had been put in place to maintain genetic variation, including the use of up to 1000 brood stock per generation. The loss of genetic variation was unequivocal being evident for both DNA methods and in all the different lines. Effective population size (Ne), as derived from linkage disequilibrium, was estimated to average about nine after 11 - 13 generations <b>in</b> the captively <b>bred</b> <b>lines,</b> compared with 263 estimated in the wild samples. This corresponds to a rate of inbreeding of about 4 % per generation for the captively <b>bred</b> <b>lines.</b> Additive genetic variance of the captively <b>bred</b> <b>lines,</b> estimated under the assumption of neutrality, ranged from about 75 % to 25 % that in the wild samples. We therefore conclude that mass selection, even when using a relatively large number of broodstock, still results in substantial loss of allelic diversity within lines over generations, and a reduction of effective population size and genetic variance, to the degree that productivity could have been compromised compared with similarly selected but outbred stocks. Loss occurred relatively consistently among the different lines. It was common for different microsatellite alleles or mtDNA haplotypes to have persisted in the different lines, such that the total number of haplotypes and allele types among all lines was much greater than that within given single lines, and the number of alleles among lines approximated that found in the wild. This observation, evident because many different lines were monitored, suggests that under certain circumstances (fixation and selection), more net genetic variability can be maintained over many generations of selection by keeping multiple different and independent lines rather than one large single line. Accordingly, if multiple lines are maintained, there could be some practical options to reconstitute allelic and haplotype variation without new introductions of genetically unimproved stock from the wild...|$|R

40|$|Rats {{selectively}} bred {{for their}} tendency to drink large or small quantities of alcohol are a useful model for investigators examining the possible neurobiological processes underlying alcoholism. Studies with the alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) and the high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) pairs of rat lines developed at Indiana University have illustrated differences in several behavioral and neurobiological characteristics associated with alcohol consumption. Specifically, compared with alcohol-avoiding rats, rats with an affinity for alcohol have a greater sensitivity to the stimulatory effects of low to moderate doses and a reduced sensitivity to {{the negative effects of}} high doses. Rats that voluntarily drink large quantities of alcohol also acquire tolerance to alcohol’s aversive effects. In addition, these rats differ from their alcohol-avoiding counterparts in the levels of several chemical mediators (i. e., neurotrans-mitters) found in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the endogenous opioids. KEY WORDS: animal strains; selective breeding; AOD preference; amount of AOD use; AOD tolerance; neurotransmitters; reinforcement; drug therapy; literature review Animal models have been critical to many areas ofresearch, including the investigation of the behavioraland neurobiological processes that may underlie alcohol abuse and alcoholism. The use of animals, rather than humans, in research has two advantages: (1) animal models allow a high degree of experimental control not possible with human subjects (i. e., scientists can focus solely on alcohol’s effects without the interference of confounding factors that may accompany alcoholism in humans, such as liver damage, poor nutrition, or psychiatric disturbances) and (2) animal models permit the use of invasive procedures. This article describes the findings of studies on rats that have been spe-cially bred for their tendencies to drink either large or small quantities of alcohol. In particular, the article focuses on characteristics associated with high and low levels of alcohol drinking that have been investigated <b>in</b> the specially <b>bred</b> <b>lines</b> of rats developed at Indiana University...|$|R

Our first objective {{was to determine the}} patterns of pathogenic variation found among isolates of Phaeoisariopsis griseola (PG), the fungus that causes angular leaf spot (ALS) in common bean. We characterized 433 PG isolates from 11 Latin American and 10 African countries, using differential cultivars, isozymes, and/or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. We also systematically screened, for ALS resistance, common bean accessions from the world collection held at CIAT, and assessed the progress so far made in breeding for resistance to ALS. Despite their great diversity within and between countries on both continents, the PG isolates were classified into two major groups: Andean, and Middle American. Although each group had internal differences for virulence, and biochemical and molecular characteristics, the Andean PG isolates were more virulent on common beans of Andean origin, than on those of Middle American origin, thus, suggesting a host-pathogen co-evolution. The Middle American PG isolates, although more virulent on common beans from Middle America, also attacked Andean beans, thus, exhibiting a much broader virulence spectrum. To find sources of resistance, we tested 22, 832 common bean accessions against naturally occurring PG isolates in the field at CIAT's Experiment Station, Quilichao, Colombia, between 1985 and 1992. The resulting 123 intermediate (scores of 4 to 6) and resistant (scores of 1 to 3) accessions were then tested in the greenhouse against selected 14 PG isolates of diverse origins. Nineteen accessions were intermediate or resistant to at least 13 of 14 PG isolates.
