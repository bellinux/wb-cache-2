5|$|On July 20, 2013, Webb {{announced}} that Hans Zimmer would be composing {{the music for}} the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. On October 25, 2013, Pharrell Williams revealed to Billboard that he would co-compose the score with Zimmer. Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel.

The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans Zimmer described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first heard on the website.|$|E

25|$|Before Vollmer died, Burroughs {{had largely}} {{completed}} his first novel, <b>Junkie,</b> {{which was written}} {{at the urging of}} Allen Ginsberg, who was instrumental in getting the work published, even as a cheap mass-market paperback. Ace Books published the novel in 1953 as part of an Ace Double under the pen name William Lee, retitling it Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict (it was later republished as <b>Junkie,</b> then in 1977 as Junky, and finally in 2003 as Junky: the definitive text of 'Junk, edited by Oliver Harris').|$|E

25|$|In May 1991, {{rather than}} {{attempting}} a straight adaptation, Canadian director David Cronenberg {{took a few}} elements from the book and combined them with elements of Burroughs' life, creating a hybrid film about {{the writing of the}} book rather than the book itself. Peter Weller starred as William Lee, the pseudonym Burroughs used when he wrote <b>Junkie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Naked Lunch (sometimes The Naked Lunch) is a {{novel by}} American writer William S. Burroughs, {{originally}} published in 1959.

25|$|After {{his career}} in music, Brood turned to {{painting}} and became a well-known character in Amsterdam art circles. His art is best described as pop-art, often very colorful and graffiti-inspired screen prints, and he achieved some commercial success and notoriety by, for instance, creating murals in various public spaces in and around Amsterdam.

25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual <b>junkie</b> {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

By 1983, however, Tony becomes {{unsatisfied}} with his lifestyle and cocaine addiction. His money launderer demands a greater percentage, while Manny resents Tony's growing paranoia and abusive treatment of Elvira. A sting by federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax evasion, with an inevitable prison sentence.

The two are immediately attracted to each other, and learn that they are both HIV positive.

Mark goes looking for Collins ("Tune Up #3"), while Roger wishes to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory").

60|$|Now, George Dally, being gifted with a {{reckless}} {{as well as}} humorous disposition, suddenly conceived the idea of perpetrating a practical joke. Perhaps <b>Junkie's</b> performances on the previous evening suggested it.

50|$|They stop {{to look at}} a map. <b>Junkie's</b> arm, {{which was}} seriously injured in the fight, is torn off by a passing semi-truck.
