Wernher von Braun was at Kummersdorf from 1932 and developed a liquid fuel rocket in which the propellant was a high percentage of alcohol and liquid oxygen. He used this in his first experimental firing. In 1934 he fired successfully his second rocket, the A2, from the Frisian island of Borkum.

50|$|The Integral Coach Factory {{consists}} of two main divisions - shell division and furnishing division. The shell division manufactures the skeleton of the rail coach, while the furnishing division {{is concerned with the}} coach interiors and amenities. An ancillary unit to the Integral Coach Factory is being built in Haldia, West Bengal for furnishing diesel multiple units. ICF manufactures more than 170 varieties of coach including first and second class coaches, pantry and kitchen cars, luggage and brake vans, self-propelled coaches, electric (EMU), diesel (DMU) and mainline electric multiple units (MEMU), metro coaches and diesel electric tower cars, accident relief medical vans (ARMV), inspection cars (RA), <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> cars, track recording cars and luxury coaches. The plant employs about 13,000 people and manufactures about 1500 coaches per year. ICF churned out 1,503 coaches in 2010 and in August 2011, ICF was sanctioned a project for manufacturing stainless steel shells and high speed bogies and an increase in capacity from 1,500 to 1,700 coaches. In 2013-14, it built 25 LHB Coaches, 248 air-conditioned and 1185 non-ac coaches. It plans to increase its manufacturing capacity of LHB coaches. It has set a target to manufacture 300 LHB coaches in 2014-15 and reach a capacity of 1000 LHB coaches by 2016-17. A total of 50,000 coaches had been produced till 18 Aug 2015 by ICF since its inception.|$|E

40|$|In 2004, WSF {{canceled}} a biodiesel <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> because of “product quality issues” {{that caused the}} fuel purifiers to clog. The cancelation of this test and the poor results negatively impacted the use of biodiesel in marine application in the Pacific Northwest. In 2006, The U. S. Department of Energy awarded the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency a grant to manage a scientific study investigating appropriate fuel specifications for biodiesel, fuel handling procedures and to conduct a <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> using biodiesel fuels in WSF operations. The Agency put together a project team comprised of experts in fields of biodiesel research and analysis, biodiesel production, marine engineering and WSF personnel. The team reviewed biodiesel technical papers, reviewed the 2004 <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> results, designed a <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> plan and provided technical assistance during the test. The research reviewed the available information on the 2004 <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> and conducted mock laboratory experiments, but {{was not able to}} determine why the fuel filters clogged. The team then conducted a literature review and designed a <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> plan. The team implemented a controlled introduction of biodiesel fuels to the test vessels while monitoring the environmental conditions on the vessels and checking fuel quality throughout the fuel distribution system. The <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> was conducted on the same three vessels that participated in the canceled 2004 test using the same ferry routes. Each vessel used biodiesel produced from a different feedstock (i. e. soy, canola and yellow grease). The vessels all ran on ultra low sulfur diesel blended with biodiesel. The percentage of biodiesel was incrementally raised form from 5 to 20 percent. Once the vessels reached the 20 percent level, they continued at this blend ratio {{for the remainder of the}} test. Fuel samples were taken from the fuel manufacturer, during fueling operations and at several points onboard each vessel. WSF Engineers monitored the performance of the fuel systems and engines. Each test vessel did experience a microbial growth bloom that produced a build up of material in the fuel purifiers similar to material witnessed in the 2004 <b>fuel</b> <b>test.</b> A biocide was added with each fuel shipment and the problem subsided. In January of 2009, the WSF successfully completed an eleven month biodiesel <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> using approximately 1, 395, 000 gallons of biodiesel blended fuels. The project demonstrated that biodiesel can be used successfully in marine vessels and that current ASTM specifications are satisfactory for marine vessels. Microbial growth in biodiesel diesel interface should be monitored. An inspection of the engines showed no signs of being negatively impacted by the test...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe objectives {{of this research}} were to show {{the relative importance of}} the transverse shearing forces, the bending meoments, and the tensile forces produced by hydraulic ram loading on military aircraft fuel tank joint designs for composite materials, and to present fuel tank test section designs. With the use of a finite element analysis, it was shown that the transverse shearing force may be major cause of attachment failure of composites, primarily by an unzipping or pull out mode of failure. It was also shown that failure criteria for transverse shearing stresses in composites are lacking. By comparing several specific aircraft design concepts, designs for a wing <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> tank and a fuselage <b>fuel</b> <b>test</b> tank were selected.

40|$|Abstract. HANARO {{has been}} used for {{radioisotope}} production, material and <b>fuel</b> irradiation <b>tests,</b> beam application research and neutron activation analysis. In the initial stage of a normal operation, the usage time of the irradiation holes located in the core was less than 40 % of the reactor operation day. To raise the number of users and utilization areas of the irradiation holes, equipments and facilities have been developed such as various capsules. Starting with the capsule containing MoO 3 in 1999, the development of the capsule for an Ir- 192 production contributed to the utilization of the irradiation holes in the core. Another area for increasing the utilization of HANARO was the <b>fuel</b> irradiation <b>tests</b> to develop new <b>fuels.</b> Various <b>fuel</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed. The major <b>fuel</b> <b>tests</b> were U 3 Si fuel produced by an atomization process, a rod type U-Mo fuel for a new research reactor fuel, U-Zr fuel, a large grained UO 2 pellet developed for a high burn-up in KAERI.
