2500|$|The Chesapeake {{economy was}} {{centered}} around tobacco, grown within the English mercantile system for export to markets in Britain and Europe. Randolph {{appears to have}} arrived in the province with little capital and few transatlantic connections. One historian suggests that he started off in the colony as an [...] "undertaker" [...] building houses, {{but there is no}} evidence for it. By 1674 he had acquired enough money to <b>import</b> 12 <b>persons</b> into the colony and thereby earned his first of many land patents (between 1674 and 1697 he imported 72 servants and 69 slaves for which he collected patents for more than 7000 acres).

He established several of his sons as merchants and ship captains.|$|R
40|$|The Florida spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, is an {{important}} item in Florida fisheries, rating high among fishery products. The fishery is centered in south Florida and the Florida Keys but the commercial range may extend into other areas as more exploratory research is done. The majority of the catch is made using wooden traps and discarded ice cans, but large numbers are taken at certain {{times of the year}} in bully nets, shrimp trawls, and by hand. The catch is sold alive. The U. S. catches cannot satisfy the demand for this tasty product and each year millions of pounds are imported from South America, Africa, Australia, and other countries. Because of the fairly high market price placed on this animal and because of the large number <b>imported,</b> several <b>persons</b> have become interested in the artificial propagation of the spiny lobster and have requested information on the commercial feasibility of lobster farming.

40|$|In Galdós 2 ̆ 7 time, the {{tensions}} between such diverse phenomena as coins and credit, free trade and protectionist tariffs, factory work and domestic economy, masculine and feminine, and private and public exacerbated friction among peoples—those of 2 ̆ 2 pueblo 2 ̆ 2 and rural origins, whose voices rasped and whose bright colors raked the eye, and a nascent, insecure bourgeosie who, fearful of the masses, strove to imitate the aristocracy. Old and new converged also {{with the question of}} suffrage and citizenship to aggravate social malaise and political upheavals—Carlist wars, palace intrigues, the Revolution of 1868 and overthrow of Queen Isabel, the brief reign of Amadeo of Savoy, the aborted First Republic and the Bourbon Restoration (1875 - 1885), which reached Spain from England in the <b>imported</b> <b>person</b> of Alfonso XII. These turbulent events undergird the cultural, historical, and political events of the novels by Benito Pérez Galdós (1843 – 1920) to be discussed in this chapter. Galdós is the author of seventy-seven novels, twenty-six original plays, and numerous occasional pieces, written between 1867 and 1920. These divide into two main categories: the historical and the contemporary social novels, now more appropriately described as 2 ̆ 2 novels of modernity 2 ̆ 2 The forty-six historical novels, called 2 ̆ 2 Episodios nacionales, 2 ̆ 2 make up five series, each consisting of ten interconnected novels, except the fifth series, left unfinished. The thirty-one 2 ̆ 2 novels of modernity, 2 ̆ 2 published between 1870 and 1915, also divide into two groups: 2 ̆ 2 Novelas de la primera época 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 Novels of the Early Period, 2 ̆ 2 1870 – 1879) and 2 ̆ 2 Las novelas de la serie contemporánea 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 The Contemporary Social Novels, 2 ̆ 2 1881 – 1915). The novels of the early period comprise Galdós 2 ̆ 7 first attempts at novel writing, as well as four so-called 2 ̆ 2 thesis novels 2 ̆ 2 : Doña Perfecta (1876), the sequel Gloria (1876 – 1877), Marianela (1878), and La familia de León Roch (2 ̆ 2 The Family of León Roch, 2 ̆ 2 1878 – 1879). The next group of novels represents what Galdós called his 2 ̆ 2 segunda manera 2 ̆ 2 —his 2 ̆ 2 second style, 2 ̆ 2 a 2 ̆ 2 different kind of writing [...] . a more sophisticated and varied mode of narrative presentation. 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|In a Wistar rat model, {{prolonged}} supplementation {{of mustard}} seed (MS) to the diet significantly ameliorates the induction of colorectal carcinomas by 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine (DMH). The {{expression of the}} splenocyte major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) was found significantly enhanced, whereas that of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) was significantly decreased. Compared to that of control animals, the proportion of spleenic B- and dendritic cells (DC) was amplified in the MS group. The expressions of MHCI, {{as well as that}} of MHCII, were increased in DC cells; whereas in B cells, MHCI expression was augmented but that of MHCII moderately decreased. The percentages of CD 8 +CD 28 + and CD 4 +CD 28 + cells were increased in the MS group, while the CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + subset was depressed. Plasma analysis showed that DMH-exposure induced amplified amounts of interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, and transforming growth factor-beta, whereas MS feeding counteracted this effect but enhanced IL- 2,IL 12 p 70,IL 21, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma. In the SW 480 colon adenocarcinoma cell-line, the cytotoxicity of spleenic T-cells from MS-fed animals was significantly increased. In the DMH-exposed rats, the expression of perforin in the spleenic T-cells was dramatically decreased, whereas MS abolished this depression. In summary, dietary MS suppresses DMH-induced immuno-imbalance as well as colon carcinogenesis in rats.

50|$|If a food is adulterated, FDA and FSIS have a {{broad array}} of {{enforcement}} tools.They are of various types. These include seizing and condemning the product, detaining <b>imported</b> product, enjoining <b>persons</b> from manufacturing or distributing the product, or requesting a recall of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the adulterated product. In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of infant formula, neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an adulterated food product. However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.|$|R
6000|$|Now that we {{have brought}} {{mandragora}} and moly into connection with the ordinary magical superstitions of savage peoples, let us see what is made of the subject by another method. Mr. R. Brown, the learned and industrious author of 'The Great Dionysiak Myth,' has investigated the traditions about the Homeric moly. He first {151} 'turns to Aryan philology.' Many guesses at the etymology of 'moly' have been made. Curtius suggests [Greek], akin to [Greek], 'soft.' This does not suit Mr. Brown, who, to begin with, is persuaded that the herb is not a magical herb, sans phrase, like those which the Hottentots use, but that {{the basis of the}} myth 'is simply the effect of night upon the world of day.' Now, as moly is a name in use among the gods, Mr. Brown thinks 'we may fairly examine the hypothesis of a foreign origin of the term.' Anyone who holds that certain Greek gods were borrowed from abroad, may be allowed to believe that the gods used foreign words, and, as Mr. Brown points out, there are foreign elements in various Homeric names of <b>imported</b> articles, peoples, <b>persons,</b> and so forth. Where, then, is a foreign word like moly, which might have reached Homer? By a long process of research, Mr. Brown finds his word in ancient 'Akkadian.' From Professor Sayce he borrows a reference to Apuleius Barbarus, about whose life nothing is known, and whose date is vague. Apuleius Barbarus may have lived about four centuries after our era, and he says that 'wild rue was called moly by the Cappadocians.' Rue, like rosemary, and indeed like most herbs, has its magical repute, and if we supposed that Homer's moly was rue, there would be some interest in the knowledge. Rue was called 'herb of grace' in English, holy water was sprinkled with it, and the name is a translation of Homer's [Greek]. Perhaps rue was used in sprinkling, because in pre-Christian times rue had, by itself, power against sprites and powers of evil. Our ancestors may have thought it as well to combine the old charm of rue and the new Christian potency of holy water. Thus there would be a distinct analogy between Homeric moly and English 'herb of grace.' ...|$|R
