25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{scientific}} revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately no {{material}} {{is available for}} investigating the vital genital anatomy. Incidentally, the animal of the type is still present withdrawn in the shell. This implies that, {{after more than a}} century, at least studies of a molecular nature and of the radula are still feasible. However, the latter can only be done after destroying the shell which for a holotype of a presumably rare species <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> advisable. At the moment no suggestion as to generic classification of ‘Achatina’ vassei can be made.|$|E

25|$|A heavy-ion {{collision}} is {{in neither}} the thermodynamic limit of large volumes nor long times. Putting aside questions {{of whether it}} is sufficiently equilibrated for thermodynamics to be applicable, there <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> enough time for weak interactions to occur, so flavor is conserved, and there are independent chemical potentials for all six quark flavors. The initial conditions (the impact parameter of the collision, the number of up and down quarks in the colliding nuclei, {{and the fact that}} they contain no quarks of other flavors) determine the chemical potentials. (Reference for this section:,).|$|E
25|$|For example, for the Tschirnhausen cubic, {{there are}} two {{infinite}} arcs having the origin (0,0) as end point. This point is the only singular point of the curve. There are also two arcs having this singular point as one end point and having a second end point with a horizontal tangent. Finally, {{there are two}} other arcs each having one of these points with horizontal tangent as the first end point and having the unique point with vertical tangent as the second end point. In contrast, the sinusoid <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> an algebraic curve, having an infinite number of monotone arcs.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly {{before the turn of the}} century; it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control.|$|E
50|$|As in The Flintstones, anachronisms are common. Altamiro himself {{develops}} several inventions that <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> prehistoric.|$|R

25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K. Balagopal, Kashmiris have a {{distinct}} sense of identity and this identity <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> irreligious, as Islam {{is very much a}} part of the identity that Kashmiris feel strongly for. He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, because there is no national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both can guarantee existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|That Boniface {{would have}} carried a {{collection}} of books with him on his journeys is without doubt. Whether the Ragyndrudis Codex {{was one of those}} books is not—its contents appear unrelated to any missionary work, and it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> a gospel. Still, it is possible {{that it was one of}} the books that were found afterward in Friesland and brought back to Utrecht, whence they traveled up the Rhine to Mainz and then Fulda. Marco Mostert considers it possible, even likely, that Radbod's recension of the vita made its way to Fulda, where the legend became attached to the damaged books that could have been Boniface's, and that by the tenth century the status of these books had been elevated to that of contact relics.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> the case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E

25|$|However, this <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> entirely true. Gerard cannot {{have spent}} much, if {{any time in}} prison, as he was {{appointed}} permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, it is certainly true that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society we are in a permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever wants more - on the job, from the partner, from the children, from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, that <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E
500|$|The crux of {{the episode}} relied {{on the idea that}} Geschwind syndrome—the ability to recall every memory of one's younger life—could be {{incurred}} via a combination of technology and drugs, a situation that <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> supported by modern medicine. Goodwin, however, himself admitted that this was completely a creative license he took with the disorder. In addition, he also based a majority of Dr. Goldstein's equipment on various New Age equipment, including a [...] "brain stimulator".|$|E

500|$|In an October 2012 interview, Hawke {{said that}} he prefers great art over politics, {{explaining}} that his preference shows [...] "how little" [...] he cares about the latter; [...] "I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, and I find that really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> my man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{view that}} Larkin {{is not a}} nihilist or pessimist, but {{actually}} displays optimism in his works, <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's lengthy study suggests {{the degree to which}} old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is Bryan Appleyard's judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who [...] "have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man". Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.|$|E
500|$|Neval later {{explained}} [...] "My {{initial reaction}} to the part was surprise as Neighbours {{have never had a}} gay character. But the nature of the character never really bothered me. My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> the only interesting thing about her." [...] Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.|$|E

500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has been}} a well known and highly sought after species {{for over a century}} and, as a result, there are many stories woven around this plant. One such example is the famous legend that N. rajah grows {{exclusively}} in the spray zones of waterfalls, on ultramafic soils. Although the latter is true, N. rajah <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> found solely in the spray zones of waterfalls and this statement seems to have little basis in fact. It is likely this misconception was popularised by Shigeo Kurata's 1976 book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, in which he states that [...] "N. rajah is rather fond of wet places like swamps or the surroundings of a waterfall".|$|E
500|$|On 8 May, it was {{reported}} that dumped ballots from the Lynnwood voting district in Pretoria had been found. According to reports, a majority of the dumped votes were for the Democratic Alliance. Helen Zille expressed her concerns over the incident to reporters at the IEC national operations centre, saying, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> conducive to public confidence in a free and fair election." [...] However, DA party agents from the voting station confirmed that the votes had already been counted. Party agent for the DA, Jordan Griffith tweeted, “I was the party agent there, those votes were counted and recorded[...]signed off. The IEC in their laziness dumped them" [...] The IEC stated that it was looking into the incident.|$|E
500|$|Rehman {{signed a}} two-year deal with Bradford City on 19 June, saying of the move, [...] "My gut feeling {{told me to}} sign for Bradford and I've {{absolutely}} no regrets. From day one I felt at home here. I'm {{fortunate enough to have}} played in all the divisions and I see this as the next step of my journey." [...] The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, [...] "Zesh <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success here, and it will be great to have him on board." [...] He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Barnet on 19 September 2009.|$|E
