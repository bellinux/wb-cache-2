5|$|During the season, Woodfull's {{physical}} courage, stoic {{and dignified}} leadership won him many admirers. He <b>flatly</b> refused to employ retaliatory tactics {{and did not}} publicly complain even though {{he and his men}} were repeatedly hit.|$|E
5|$|Slade {{tells the}} Kid that Shooter will {{continue}} to cheat for him and confronts him with a menacing thug, but the Kid <b>flatly</b> refuses. Back at the game, The Kid maneuvers to have Shooter replaced by Lady Fingers, lying that Shooter is ill. He then wins several major pots from Howard, who is visibly losing confidence.|$|E
5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) {{officials said they were}} present at what they called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari <b>flatly</b> denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen <b>flatly</b> refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be <b>flatly</b> accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|France's {{claim to}} Madagascar as its {{protectorate}} was officially recognized by Britain in the Anglo-French agreement of 1890. Between 1890 and 1894, the French sought to aggressively claim {{what they believed}} to be the territorial rights established by the treaty. However, these French land claims and settlements were perceived by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony as an unjustifiable encroachment upon Malagasy sovereignty. Ultimately Charles Le Myre de Vilers was sent to persuade the queen and her prime minister to submit to the French interpretation of the treaty with the intent to launch a war and take the island by force if an agreement was not reached. The French offer was <b>flatly</b> refused and diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar were broken off in November 1894.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} could join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty was compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra <b>flatly</b> refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry a man who was more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E
5|$|Otto Warmbier, an American student {{held captive}} in North Korea for 17 months, was {{released}} to U.S. officials {{the same day}} as Rodman's visit to North Korea. Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all <b>flatly</b> denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman's visit and the U.S. government. The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier was negotiated and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department's special envoy on North Korea. Warmbier who was in a nonresponsive coma throughout much of his imprisonment in North Korea, died days after being returned to his family in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Wayne {{originally}} intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, {{but by the time}} he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan <b>flatly</b> refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was <b>flatly</b> refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) <b>flatly</b> refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are {{the winged}} orders of insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold <b>flatly</b> over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera {{have turned out to be}} more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Malta {{returned}} {{control of the}} central Mediterranean to Britain and was {{an important step in}} the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger <b>flatly</b> refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this clause of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons {{appointed}} Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home {{for the rest of their}} lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either <b>flatly</b> declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to <b>flatly</b> admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria <b>flatly</b> declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E
5|$|The Puranas {{introduce}} {{themes that}} are echoed in later works, including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate {{to have sex}} {{at the cost of}} neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra's deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram. A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana. At times, Indra {{takes the form of a}} cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ahalya comes to bathe in the Svarnadi (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama's form, Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is <b>flatly</b> refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} {{supported}} by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish. Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish. On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain. James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's Rhineland home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. James <b>flatly</b> told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment, which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Assad reported by SANA on 24 August 2006, Assad <b>flatly</b> refused demarcation of the Syrian/Lebanese border near Shebaa Farms before a withdrawal of Israeli troops.|$|E
25|$|Levin {{repeated}} the term on NPR. The term describes {{a strategy of}} <b>flatly</b> denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence against the defendant, no matter how overwhelming. R. Kelly was ultimately found not guilty on all charges.|$|E
25|$|Though it {{was often}} rumored during his Hüsker Dü days that he and bandmate Mould were an item (Hart was openly bisexual, Mould is openly gay, and both {{acknowledge}} taking partners on tour), both have <b>flatly</b> denied ever having been romantically involved.|$|E
25|$|The band is also remembered internationally for {{rumors that}} they were the Beatles {{recording}} under a pseudonym. Klaatu themselves did not start these rumors and always <b>flatly</b> denied them, and indeed no Beatle was ever involved in the writing, recording or production of any Klaatu material.|$|E
25|$|As {{for public}} schooling, no states during {{this era of}} Reconstruction {{actually}} required separate schools for blacks. However, some states (e.g. New York) gave local districts discretion to set up schools that were deemed separate but equal. In contrast, Iowa and Massachusetts <b>flatly</b> prohibited segregated schools ever since the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{campaign}} that what Lenihan had told friends and insiders in private <b>flatly</b> contradicted his public statements on a controversial effort in 1982 by the then opposition Fianna Fáil to pressure President Hillery into refusing a parliamentary dissolution to then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald; Hillery had resolutely rejected the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, in September 2011, Netflix {{announced}} that it would spin off its popular DVD business under a new brand name, Qwikster, leading to customer and market confusion. Netflix reversed the decision less than a month later. During this time, the company's stock value plummeted and Hastings was asked about resigning, but he <b>flatly</b> rejected the idea.|$|E
25|$|He criticizes Secretary of State Colin Powell for {{promoting}} the decision taken by President George H. W. Bush not to remove Saddam Hussein from power after the 1991 Gulf War. He <b>flatly</b> takes the opposite view. Rumsfeld additionally describes Powell as {{the representative of}} State Department views to Bush {{rather than the other}} way around.|$|E
25|$|Questioned by police, Collins <b>flatly</b> denied {{even knowing}} Schell, and insisted {{he had spent}} the weekend of June 29–30 with his mother at her house in the Detroit suburb of Center Line, and had not {{returned}} to Ypsilanti until the morning of July 1. Initially, police took him at his word, and did not seek to verify his alibi.|$|E
25|$|In the United States v. Nicholson, the {{defendant}} moved to suppress all evidence gathered under a FISA order. 955 F.Supp. 588 (Va. 1997). The court affirmed {{the denial of}} the motion. There the court <b>flatly</b> rejected claims that FISA violated Due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, Equal protection, Separation of powers, nor the Right to counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|The paper <b>flatly</b> {{ridiculed}} AI research, {{comparing it}} to alchemy: a misguided attempt to change metals to gold based on a theoretical foundation that {{was no more than}} mythology and wishful thinking. It ridiculed the grandiose predictions of leading AI researchers, predicting that there were limits beyond which AI would not progress and intimating that those limits would be reached soon.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex {{is often}} {{regarded}} as taboo, but most countries {{do not have}} laws which ban the practice. Commonly, people do not regard oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary. People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving oral sex, or may <b>flatly</b> refuse {{to engage in the}} practice.|$|E
25|$|Every {{planar graph}} has a flat and linkless {{embedding}}: simply embed the graph into {{a plane and}} embed the plane into space. If a graph is planar, {{this is the only}} way to embed it <b>flatly</b> and linklessly into space: every flat embedding can be continuously deformed to lie on a flat plane. And conversely, every nonplanar linkless graph has multiple linkless embeddings.|$|E
25|$|Orlok {{objects to}} this, insisting that no trial is {{necessary}} as Dredd's guilt is indisputable, {{but he is}} overruled, and to punish his insubordination he is ordered to act as Dredd's defence counsel. When the prosecution finishes their case, Orlok calls Dredd as a witness, but Dredd <b>flatly</b> refuses to participate, denouncing the trial as a farce. Unable to bring himself to speak on Dredd's behalf, Orlok simply rests his case.|$|E
25|$|In France, lacking {{an answer}} to his {{question}} or satisfactory settlement of his truce, Philip VI openly assembled an army of 6,000 soldier to send to support the Scottish troops, to whom he had also been sending supplies since February of that year. Notice was sent to Edward III, informing {{him that if he}} did not submit the dispute to the arbitration of France and the Pope, the French soldiers would be deployed. Edward III <b>flatly</b> refused the demand.|$|E
25|$|A second {{marriage}} ceremony {{appears to have}} taken place a few months before his death in 1735. By his second wife, he appears to have had no issue. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica (1911), {{it was only a few}} months before his death that Anastasia died; however, this is <b>flatly</b> contradicted by the evidence that Anastasia, Countess of Peterborough and Monmouth, survived until 1755 and that the purported {{second marriage}} ceremony never took place in 1735.|$|E
25|$|After Foote had <b>flatly</b> {{rejected}} Pope's {{request that}} gunboats run past Island No. 10, someone on Pope's staff suggested that perhaps a canal {{could be cut}} to enable Union vessels to bypass the batteries. The canal was completed in two weeks, {{but it was not}} deep enough to provide passage for the gunboats. It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and supply vessels could use it, so that Pope did not have to depend on land communications.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} method, {{developed by}} Joseph Greenberg, is mass comparison. The method, which disavows any ability to date developments, aims simply to show which languages {{are more and}} less close to each other. Greenberg suggested that the method is useful for preliminary grouping of languages known to be related {{as a first step}} toward more in-depth comparative analysis. However, since mass comparison eschews the establishment of regular changes, it is <b>flatly</b> rejected by the majority of historical linguists.|$|E
