For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E

After Spinetta's death, President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said: [...] "That record of the teardrop, when we would call albums long plays, and [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> them." [...] Charly García, also on the occasion of Spinetta's death, stated: [...] "I can not describe the shock that Almendra's first album caused me.

The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and John's son, Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia {{had been part of}} the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it [...] "a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life." [...] Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: [...] "I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ...

Robertson himself said: [...] "I think he was wrong and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> it."

It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra noted that his education had come from [...] "the school of hard knocks" [...] and was suitably touched by the award. He went on to describe that [...] "this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> what you have done for me today".

500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms {{when he first saw}} her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E

Speaking at the Annual Ripken Fan Club Banquet, {{general manager}} Roland Hemond said, [...] " [...] {{was a tough}} year for the Orioles, a tough year for me, and a tough year for the Ripken family. There {{was a lot of}} trauma, and I {{respected}} them for the way they handled it. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> it." [...] Brady Anderson, who would play for the Orioles from 1988 through 2001 and hit 50 home runs in 1996, credited Ripken for helping him make it with the Orioles: [...] "I'll never forget earlier in my career how Cal Sr. stayed with me, trying to help me become a better player when it might not have been the fashionable thing to do within the organization." [...] Ripken remained with the team until after the 1992 season, when he was removed from third-base coach duties as the Orioles wished to give younger coaches opportunities. The Orioles offered him the brand new position of coordinator of minor league field operations, but he declined, disappointed at being removed from third base. Ripken maintained that he was not retired, but he would never coach professionally again.|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> {{for the rest of}} my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, [...] "Sweetest Thing", as its single.

Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E
