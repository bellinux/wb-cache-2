2500|$|In the United Kingdom, two {{grades of}} heating oil are defined. BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, wick heaters, and mixed with {{gasoline}} in some vintage combustion engines {{as a substitute}} for tractor vaporising oil. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>oil.</b> Premium kerosene is usually sold in 5 or 20 liter containers from hardware, camping and garden stores and is often dyed purple. [...] Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is undyed.|$|E

50|$|In 1971 S&D {{supplied}} some TN 1,200 gallon tankers to BP {{for delivering}} <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> fuel <b>oil</b> in London. With its 6 ft. 6 ins. width and high manouvrability the tanker was ideal for this purpose.

50|$|The {{rising cost}} of <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> gas <b>oil</b> has reawakened a desire for {{alternative}} fuel sources and burning wood is carbon neutral.

40|$|The {{economical}} {{crisis that}} hit Greece after 2009, significantly affected its energy consumption profile {{due to the}} increased price of <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and gasoline. The specific study aims at the quantification of the carbon dioxide emissions in municipal level due to energy and fuel consumption. Three different municipalities in North Greece (Kavala, Alexandroupolis and Drama) were assessed with the application of three different carbon footprint estimation approaches in each one of them, including two life cycle assessment methods. Results ranged from 511, 799 to 571, 000, 435, 250 to 489, 000 and 355, 207 to 398, 000 tons CO 2 and tons CO 2 -eq. for Kavala, Alexandroupolis and Drama respectively. The analysis per energy type indicated the electrical energy consumption as the key factor affecting the results due to the relatively high CO 2 emission coefficient of the electricity produced in Greece. The analysis per sector indicated that a percentage of nearly 75...|$|E
5000|$|As a {{substitute}} for petrol, TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly used as a <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a low octane rating and would damage an engine built for petrol. The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from what is now sold as <b>heating</b> <b>oil.</b> These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back {{in a controlled manner}} into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70.|$|R

40|$|Solar {{collectors}} offer considerable {{potential for}} reducing the energy supplied from fossil-fuel sources for <b>domestic</b> water <b>heating.</b> Solar <b>domestic</b> hot water plants are usually arranged with a large collector area so that they provide a large fraction of the energy required. However, using a smaller collectro area, just to preheat the water, results in much lower costs. This project provides perheated water for the heating system for 200 occupants of a housing estate and conserves the equivalent of 9, 000 litres of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> per year...|$|R

50|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>oil</b> is {{used for}} home heating in England, Scotland and Wales, {{typically}} in premises away from mains gas. There are around 1.5 million people in Great Britain using <b>oil</b> for home <b>heating.</b> Great Britain has many suppliers of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> ranging from large companies such as BP and Crown Oil to local oil suppliers covering very small areas. Many villages may use buying groups to order <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> at the same time, thereby accessing lower costs. Many <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> suppliers will choose to list their prices on independent <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> price comparison websites.

In the UK and Northern Ireland, it is possible to search for prices by town name, county and postcode prefix.|$|R

At a July 2008 price of $4.64 a gallon that amounts to $4,100 per Maine household. The Task Force concluded that wood-to-energy can lower the cost of home heating approximately 25 to 50% of the cost of No. 2 <b>heating</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R

Unlike other petroleum products, <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> is primarily distributed to consumers through family-owned small businesses, rather than the large oil companies. Although United States distributors provide the Department of Energy the average price per gallon for their users, they typically do not list their prices on comparison websites, instead preferring to provide quotes which best match the property.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of {{temperature}} shock on both near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns by extending the weather and storage models of the previous study. Several notable findings from the empirical studies are presented. First, the expected temperature shock significantly and positively affects both the near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns. Next, significant temperature shock has effect on both the conditional mean and volatility of natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> prices. The results indicate that expected inventory surprises significantly and negatively affects the far-month natural gas futures returns. Moreover, volatility of natural gas futures returns is higher on Thursdays and that of near-month <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns is higher on Wednesdays than other days. Finally, it is found that storage announcement for natural gas significantly affects near-month and far-month natural gas futures returns. Furthermore, both natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns are affected more by the weighted average temperature reported by multiple weather reporting stations than that reported by a single weather reporting station...|$|R
