5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany.

Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} accounts <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> a year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E
