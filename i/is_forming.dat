5|$|In males, the semen <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the penis. The penis {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That {{is to say that}} when a liquid <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E
25|$|Multidirectional Forging <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> of a {{work piece}} in a single step in several directions. The multidirectional forming takes place through {{constructive}} measures of the tool. The vertical movement of the press ram is redirected using wedges which distributes and redirects {{the force of the}} forging press in horizontal directions.|$|E

25|$|Dilaceration is an {{abnormal}} bend {{found on a}} tooth, and is nearly always associated with trauma that moves the developing tooth bud. As a tooth <b>is</b> <b>forming,</b> a force can move the tooth from its original position, leaving {{the rest of the}} tooth to form at {{an abnormal}} angle. Cysts or tumors adjacent to a tooth bud are forces known to cause dilaceration, as are primary (baby) teeth pushed upward by trauma into the gingiva where it moves the tooth bud of the permanent tooth.|$|E
25|$|Zone {{distillation}} is a {{distillation process}} in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is {{moving from the}} top {{to the bottom of}} the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution <b>is</b> <b>forming.</b> Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.|$|E
5|$|While {{all four}} boroughs <b>were</b> <b>formed</b> after Sullivan County was established, {{seven of the}} nine townships <b>were</b> <b>formed</b> while still part of Lycoming County. The first of these was Shrewsbury Township, which {{encompassed}} all of modern Sullivan County when it <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> in 1803. Elkland Township <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> from Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833). Plunketts Creek Township <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> from Franklin and Davidson Townships in 1838, and Fox Township <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> from Elkland in 1839. When Sullivan County <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> in 1847, both Shrewsbury and Plunketts Creek Townships were split, with each county having a township of that name. Plunketts Creek Township in Sullivan County {{changed its name to}} Hillsgrove Township in 1856. Sullivan County has no former townships, and no counties have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> from it.|$|R

25|$|As {{with other}} regions, tubule {{cells in the}} distal {{convoluted}} tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine <b>is</b> <b>forming)</b> into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, {{as well as the}} sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{chose to}} {{illustrate}} Gray's words literally, creating {{what has been}} described as [...] "a poetic romance". Youth and Pleasure depicts a small gilded boat. Above the boat, a nude figure representing Zephyr blows on the sails. Another nude representing Pleasure lies on a large bouquet of flowers, loosely holding the helm of the boat and allowing Zephyr's breeze to guide it. A nude child blows bubbles, which another nude on the prow of the ship, representing Youth, reaches to catch. Naiads, again nude, swim around and clamber on the boat. Although the seas are calm, a [...] "sweeping whirlwind" [...] <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> on the horizon, with a demonic figure within the storm clouds. (Deterioration and restoration means this demonic figure is now barely visible.) The intertwined limbs of the participants were intended to evoke the sensation of transient and passing pleasure, and to express the themes of female sexual appetites entrapping innocent youth, and the sexual power women hold over men.|$|E
500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bailey {{described}} {{a concept of}} racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a [...] "ladder of evolution". These '"races" [...] do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the Aryan root race (or '5th race'), is an [...] "emerging new race" [...] and so a relative new evolutionary phenomena. [...] The term [...] "Aryan" [...] as used by her has a different meaning than a separative or racist use of the word. She stated that this newer type <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> in every land but primarily in lands where Caucasian peoples are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. Bailey considered the Aryan race {{to be determined by}} a state of consciousness rather than by genetic or racial traits. [...] She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness.

2500|$|The National Science Foundation funded {{researcher}} David Berube {{to study}} the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz. [...] This study concludes {{that much of what}} is sold as “nanotechnology” is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a “nanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like” which will “end up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." [...] Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a [...] "nano bubble" [...] will form, or <b>is</b> <b>forming</b> already, from {{the use of the term}} by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.|$|E
