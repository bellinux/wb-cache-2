40|$|Feelings <b>of</b> <b>incompetence</b> are {{an ongoing}} {{part of the}} private {{experience}} of being a therapist. Although normative, they are often linked to therapist stress, distress, and to negative therapeutic processes and outcomes. Yet systematic inquiries into the subjective judgment of oneself as inadequate and incompetent {{in the role of}} therapist are virtually nonexistent and even more rare for experienced therapists. A qualitative approach was used in this study to obtain rich descriptions of therapists' encounters with feelings <b>of</b> <b>incompetence.</b> Eight therapists with ten years of experience or more were recruited for the study. Guided by a semi-structured interview protocol, they were interviewed for ninety minutes. The resulting transcripts were analysed with procedures based on grounded theory methodology (Strauss & Corbin, 1992). Results indicated that feelings <b>of</b> <b>incompetence</b> existed on a spectrum of intensity and that the experience was multiply determined. A dynamic, pan-theoretical, and multidimensional theory <b>of</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>incompetence</b> is presented. The substantive theory summarises the relationship between the main categories of nature and depth of self-doubt, sources, consequences, and mediating factors. These categories are organised around the core category of intensity...|$|R

Consistent with predictions, fewer incompetent behaviors were recorded in the formal log than in informal notes for White male trainees.

40|$|The {{adaptation}} {{process of}} a species to a new environment is a significant area of study in biology. As part of natural selection, adaptation is a mutation process which improves survival skills and reproductive functions of species. Here, we investigate this process by combining the idea <b>of</b> <b>incompetence</b> with evolutionary game theory. In the sense <b>of</b> evolution, <b>incompetence</b> and training {{can be interpreted as}} a special learning process. With focus on the social side of the problem, we analyze the influence <b>of</b> <b>incompetence</b> on behavior <b>of</b> species. We introduce an incompetence parameter into a learning function in a single-population game and analyze its effect on the outcome of the replicator dynamics. Incompetence can change the outcome of the game and its dynamics, indicating its significance within what are inherently imperfect natural systems. Comment: 17 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the recent}} surge of {{activity}} on the subject, we present a brief non-technical survey of numerous classical and new results in discrepancy theory related to Roth’s orthogonal function method. The goal {{of this paper is}} to survey the use of Roth’s orthogonal function method in the theory <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution, which, in a broad sense, means applications of orthogonal function decompositions to proving discrepancy estimates. The idea originated in a seminal paper of Klaus Roth [61, 1954] that, according to his own words “started a new theory ” [26]. Since then and up to today this approach has been widely exploited to produce new important results in the the area. In the present expository article we trace the method from its origins to recent results (to which the author has made some contribution). It is our intention to keep the exposition concise, simple, and unobscured by the technicalities. We shall concentrate on the heuristics and intuition behind the underlying ideas, introduce classical and novel points of view on the method, as well as connections to other areas of mathematics. Before we proceed to the main part of the discussion, I would like to emphasize the tremendous influence that the aforementioned paper of Roth [61], entitled “On <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution”, has had on the development of the field. Even the number of papers with identical or similar titles, that appeared in the subsequent years, attests to its importance: 4 papers by Roth himself (On <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution. I-IV, [61 – 64]), one by H. Davenport (Note on <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution, [33]), 10 by W. M. Schmidt (<b>Irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution. I-IX, [65 – 74]), 2 by J. Beck (Note on <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution. I-II, [5, 6]), 4 by W. W. L. Chen (On <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution. I-IV, [21 – 24]), at least 2 by Beck and Chen (Note on <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> distribution. I-II, [3, 8] and several others with similar, but more specific names), as well as the fundamental monograph on the subject by Beck and Chen, “Irregularities of distribution”, [4]...|$|R

40|$|Albertson [3] {{has defined}} the <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> a simple undirected graph G = (V, E) as irr(G) = (formula presented), where dc(u) denotes {{the degree of}} a vertex u ϵ V. Recently, this graph {{invariant}} gained interest in the chemical graph theory, where it occured in some bounds on {{the first and the}} second Zagreb index, and was named the third Zagreb index [12]. For general graphs with n vertices, Albertson has obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound on the <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> 4 n 3 / 27. Here, by exploiting a different approach than in [3], we show that for general graphs with n vertices the upper bound (formula presented) is sharp. We also present lower bounds on the maximal <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> graphs with fixed minimal and/or maximal vertex degrees, and consider an approximate computation <b>of</b> the <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> a graph.
