5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and {{war broke out}} between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in <b>his</b> <b>capacity</b> of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E
