5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does <b>he</b> <b>say</b> anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81â€“91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but {{it never occurred to me}} that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did <b>he</b> <b>say?!</b> Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E

On the April 7 episode of SmackDown!, authority figure Theodore Long, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, scheduled a series of number one contenders matches, after JBL, Eddie Guerrero, (Rey Mysterio), The Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle all demanded a WWE Championship match.

After the match ended in a double disqualification, Long booked JBL, Angle, Booker T, and Big Show in a standard wrestling match involving four wrestlers, dubbed as a Fatal Four-Way match, for the following week.

[...] and [...] "Then shall <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, ye cursedâ€¦'" [...] Similarly the location of the caryatid-like figures from the Old Testament also emphasizes who the lord of the manor sees as his peers: the lawmaker, the military leader and the prophet are at his level at to his right.|$|E

This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made.
