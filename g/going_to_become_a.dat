25|$|The Kriegsmarine—Luftwaffe {{conflict}} continued {{along the}} same lines as before over the course of 1937 and 1938. Göring did not openly reject the claims of the navy, nor did he deny the importance of air power in sea warfare, which gave him plenty of latitude in discussions. Göring continued to show willingness to cooperate, but only in matters that the Luftwaffe could profit from the suggestions and research of the Kriegsmarine. He ordered the dismemberment of naval–air activities and organisations at his own discretion and according to his own plans. The position of the navy became weaker. Göring had been named Hitler's deputy for the Four Year Plan and he was now in a position to govern all policy concerning the allocation of aerial resources. Under those circumstances it appears Raeder and the navy accepted that a naval air arm was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> reality. The final confirmation of how the air and sea arms were to interact was decided at a conference on 27 February 1939 and ratified by a memorandum drawn up by Karl Bodenschatz (adjutant to Göring) signed by Göring and Raeder. The former would retain all control over naval air units and operational control would be exercised by a Luftwaffe officer assigned to the Kriegsmarine.|$|E

He {{felt that the}} show was a cross between Fringe and Heroes with {{elements}} of The X-Files included. He {{thought that there was}} a potential for the series to be a success and thought that it would attract both Marvel fans and new viewers alike. Dave Bradley gave the episode four and a half out of five for SFX magazine, saying that the show was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon alongside Doctor Who, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. He felt that using the Skye character to introduce the viewer to the series was cheesy, but effective. He praised J August Richards' performance but did not enjoy some of the characterizations of the main characters, which made him think the team was similar to that seen in Torchwood.|$|E
500|$|Madero also [...] {{earned the}} great displeasure of other revolutionaries, including, Pascual Orozco. Madero's first act after the treaty was signed was {{a gesture of}} {{reconciliation}} with the Díaz regime. As {{a result of the}} treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la Barra cabinet. He chose mostly upper class Maderistas, including his wife for the post in the treasury. He also maintained the existing federal system, by keeping the sitting judges of the Supreme Court, the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies. Venustiano Carranza, who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of Mexico, stated that, after the treaty, Madero had [...] "deliver(ed) to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again". Díaz, after leaving for exile in France, observed that [...] "Madero has unleashed a tiger, let us see if he can control him".|$|E

[...] He {{grew up listening to}} the forró music of his native northeast, and took an {{interest in}} the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil's mother was the [...] "chief supporter" [...] in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga [...] "because he sang about the world around , the world that [...] encountered." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but {{it never occurred to me}} that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E

He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have been times since his death when the information they need inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel room, and he is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks right at him, and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} despite [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope" [...] not being [...] "strong" [...] {{as the last}} episode it had [...] "many funny moments scattered throughout" [...] that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E
