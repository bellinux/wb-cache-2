40|$|In {{the early}} days of programming, when {{machines}} were hard-wired and every byte of storage was precious, subroutines were invented to conserve memory. Their function was to allow programmers to execute code segments more than once, and under different (parameterized) circumstances, without having to duplicate that code in each physical location where it was needed. Software reuse was born. However, this was a different breed of reuse than we know today: This was reuse to serve the machine, to conserve mechanical resources. Reuse to save human resources was yet to come. Soon, programmers observed that they could <b>insert</b> <b>subroutines</b> extracted from their previous programs, or even written by other programmers, and take advantage of the functionality without having to concern themselves with the details of coding. Generally-useful subroutines were collected into libraries, and soon very few people would ever again have to worry about how to implement, for example, a numerically-well-behaved double-precision cosine routine. This phenomenon represented a powerful and fundamental paradigm shift in how we regarded software. Invoking a subroutine from a library became indistinguishable fro...|$|R

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} plays {{a critical}} role in maintaining genetic diversity as well as genome stability. Interesting examples implying hyper-recombination are found in nature. In chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) genome, DNA sequences flanked by inverted repeats undergo inversion very frequently, suggesting hyper-recombinational events. However, mechanisms responsible for these events remain unknown. We previously observed very frequent inversion in a designed amplification system based on double rolling circle replication (DRCR). Here, utilizing the yeast 2 -μm plasmid and an amplification system, we show that DRCR is closely related to hyper-recombinational events. Inverted repeats or <b>direct</b> repeats <b>inserted</b> into these systems frequently caused inversion or deletion/duplication, respectively, in a DRCR-dependent manner. Based on these observations, we suggest that DRCR might be also involved in naturally occurring chromosome rearrangement associated with gene amplification and the replication of cpDNA and HSV genomes.

40|$|The NEMO {{model is}} a {{state-of-the-art}} ocean circulation model. For data assimilation applications with ensemble Kalman filters like the SEEK filter, e. g. for operational ocean forecasting, NEMO is typically run separately from the assimilation algorithm. This procedure generates a set of restart files on disks that hold the ensemble of model forecasts providing the error covariance matrix information for the ensemble Kalman filter. These files need to be read by a separate assimilation program that computes the analysis step of the filter algorithm and generates new restart files for NEMO. This scheme requires {{a large amount of}} disk storage as well as time to read and write restart files and to perform the model restarts.

The frequency of deletions (selected as Ampr revertants) was stimulated by palindromy only at lengths greater than 26 bp. The 4 -bp direct repeats, one component of which {{is located in the}} palindromic insert, were used preferentially as deletion endpoints with palindromes of at least 18 bp but not of 16 or 10 bp. We interpret these results with a model of slippage during DNA replication. Because deletion frequency and deletion endpoint location depend differently on palindrome length, we propose that different factors commit a molecule to undergo deletion and determine exactly where deletion endpoints will be. Short repeated sequences are commonplace in bacterial DNAs. They specify important structural features in rRNAs and tRNAs, often serve as sites of regulation of gene expression, and may also help maintain the overall organi-zation of DNA domains in the bacterial nucleoid (8, 9, 12, 18).
