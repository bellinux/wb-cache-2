5|$|More than 99 {{percent of}} all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are {{estimated}} to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> database to date, leaving at least 80 percent not yet described.|$|E
5|$|Born in Isleworth, Greater London, Mousinho {{was signed}} by then Brentford manager Martin Allen during the 2005–06 season, after {{returning}} from the United States where he was studying and playing at the University of Notre Dame. He was recommended to Brentford by Martin Allen's son, having previously been on the books at Chesham United. He made his Brentford debut in October 2005 in a 1–1 against Oxford United in the Football League Trophy; playing the whole match. He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4–1 away win over Tranmere Rovers, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. Initially he acted as cover for regular right-back Kevin O'Connor, but was then played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> midfield role. He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006, when Clark Masters was sent-off, {{and there was not}} a substitute goalkeeper available; the game ended 2–2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, Müller {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Bayern Munich through 2013. During {{the second half of}} the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter, usually playing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04, and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career, in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern. The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC, a match which Müller started.|$|E

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Ngoia Pollard {{began her}} {{contemporary}} artistic career by assisting her husband, who painted with Papunya Tula artists {{for several years}} prior to his death. In 1997, Ngoia Pollard began painting independently, and in 2004 won the first prize <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> Australian painting competition supported by the region's major newspaper, the Centralian Advocate. In 2006, Ngoia Pollard won the painting prize in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, with her work Swamps west of Nyirripi. Another of her works painted in the same year, and carrying the same title, was acquired by the Art Gallery of South Australia. 2006 was also marked by an artist's residency in Copenhagen, shared with fellow Indigenous artist Lilly Kelly Napangardi, whom she had known since they attended school together in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|SMS Hansa {{was built}} in 1868–1875, the first ironclad built in Germany; all {{previous}} German ironclads had been built in foreign shipyards. This resulted in a much longer period of construction, however, as she was built by the relatively inexperienced Royal Dockyard in Danzig. She was named after the Hanseatic League, known in Germany simply as Hanse, Latinized Hansa. The ship was launched in October 1872 and commissioned into the Imperial Navy in May 1875. Designed for overseas service, Hansa was classed as an armored corvette and armed with eight 21cm guns <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> battery.|$|E

5|$|SMS Oldenburg {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin in 1883, launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended {{to have been a}} fifth member of the Sachsen class, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ships of the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24cm guns amidships, six <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel.|$|E
5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series to feature the {{character}} of Worf, who had previously been a character on , <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> storyline. Due to time restraints in filming, there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously. The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, including the use of Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the processes by which living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bloody}} setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took {{six weeks to}} {{carefully}} plan another crossing of the Danube. He launched this operation late on 4 July and, by {{the early hours of}} the next day, he had managed to get a substantial force across the river. Nansouty's division did not see any action during the first day of the Battle at Wagram and at night they camped behind the Imperial Guard. The next day, 6 July, Nansouty was at first directed to support Davout, on the French right, but when it became clear that the latter's sector was not threatened by the arrival of enemy reinforcements, they were ordered back into reserve <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> position on the battlefield, not far from the village of Aderklaa. Then, as the situation on the French left rapidly deteriorated, they were called into action, when Napoleon ordered Marshal Bessières, commander of the Cavalry Reserve, to launch his men in a charge against the Austrians menacing his left. With time at the essence, Bessières opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and, with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of the battlefield, he decided to lead forward only Nansouty's men. This division was indeed very strong: 24 squadrons, more than 4,000 men, including Brigadier General Defrance's 1st and 2nd carabiniers-à-cheval, Brigadier General Doumerc's 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and Brigadier General Berckheim's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers.|$|E

5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central,</b> balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
