2500|$|In his summing up, the coroner, H.R. Oswald, {{stated that}} Kempton {{was in a}} {{depressed}} state and short of money, [...] "Her life was precarious, and {{she was one of}} those who tried to turn night into day". He doubted the evidence of Chang which contradicted that of Heinberg but thought there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against Chang. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, at which, according to the News of the World, [...] "Chang smiled broadly and quickly left the court. As he passed out, several well-dressed girls patted his shoulder, while one ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair".|$|E
2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking {{the ball into the}} end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, importantâ€”like a league game or something." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{raised his}} hat, {{and ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "In great pain," [...] replied Mr. Lavender faintly, [...] "in great pain." [...] And, indeed, he was; for {{the nervous}} crisis {{from which he}} was {{suffering}} had settled in the tooth, on which he still pressed a <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> cheek.|$|R
60|$|She {{extended}} the unkissed hand. Jeff took it, but presently let the limp <b>fingers</b> fall <b>through</b> <b>his</b> own.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} Mr. Tiernan stood silent before her, his legs apart, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> running <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bristly hair.|$|R
60|$|He started, {{and ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> rough hair in an overwrought manner.|$|E
60|$|Morris ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> untidy {{hair and}} opened his lips to answer.|$|E
60|$|And Adolph {{tossed his}} head, and passed his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> scented hair, with a grace.|$|E
60|$|As she talked, she {{continued}} to pass her <b>fingers</b> caressingly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, sorrowful for the pain that she was inflicting.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do spoil me," [...] she said, {{running her}} <b>fingers</b> affectionately <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, {{while he was}} on his knees unbuttoning her boots.|$|R
6000|$|Beginning, {{from the}} mere force of habit, some half-delirious {{reference}} to the weather, Edwin suddenly stopped, passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> wildly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, and again said, with deep earnestness,--"Emma." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor old Corky ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{hair in a}} temperamental sort of way. He groaned.|$|E
60|$|He stooped {{down and}} threw the wrap over her shoulders. Then he drew her {{reluctant}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Perkins, slowly {{dragging}} his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard, {{looked at him}} thoughtfully. He seemed to speak almost to himself.|$|E
60|$|Ruth's <b>fingers</b> wandered idly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. She did {{not speak}} for some moments.|$|R
60|$|Removing his hat, Julian Jones guided my <b>finger</b> tips <b>through</b> <b>his</b> thatch {{of sandy}} hair until they sank into an indentation. It was fully three inches long, {{and went into}} the bone itself of the skull.|$|R
60|$|Philip did not answer. Mr. Perkins, holding himself oddly as {{he always}} did, like a figure in one of Perugino's pictures, drew <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> thoughtfully <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard. He looked at Philip {{as though he were}} trying to {{understand}} and then abruptly told him he might go.|$|R
60|$|The German seemed bewildered; {{he ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bushy hair as {{if trying}} to {{remember}} what he had said.|$|E
60|$|The young pugilist, {{who had a}} curious, lanky figure, and a craggy, bony face, {{passed his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{close-cropped}} hair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-evening, sir,' said Mr Folair, {{taking off}} the tall hat, and running his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. 'I bring a communication. Hem!' ...|$|E
60|$|Spike sat up, groaning. Equipped {{though he}} was by nature with a skull of the purest and most solid ivory, the fall had disconcerted him. His eyes, like those of Shakespeare's poet, rolling in a fine frenzy, did glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. He passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> tenderly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{vermilion}} hair.|$|R
60|$|Good by! Are {{you alive}} or dead? {{and what are}} you about? Still {{scribbling}} for the Democratic? And do those infernal compositors and proof-readers misprint your unfortunate productions as vilely as ever? It is too bad. Let every man manufacture his own nonsense, say I. Expect me home soon, and--to whisper you a secret--in company with the poet Campbell, who purposes to visit Wyoming and enjoy the shadow of the laurels that he planted there. Campbell is now an old man. He calls himself well, better than ever in his life, but looks strangely pale, and so shadow-like that one might almost poke a <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> densest material. I tell him, by way of joke, that he is as dim and forlorn as Memory, though as unsubstantial as Hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only last night," [...] {{continued}} Queeker to himself, {{still standing}} bolt upright {{in a frenzy}} of inspiration, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> fiercely <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, so as to make it stand bolt upright too--"only last night I heard old Durant say he could not make up his mind where to go to spend the autumn this year. Why not Ramsgate? why not Ramsgate? ...|$|R
6000|$|Cecily. You dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, {{she puts}} her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it? ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Mr. Kipps rubbed his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair with an {{expression}} of some perplexity {{and went back to the}} beginning.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, {{and ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, in all directions; his {{features}} fidgetting and distorting themselves ominously, while he looked at me.|$|E
60|$|In Sibyl's {{own room}} they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's heart, and a fierce, murderous {{hatred of the}} {{stranger}} who, as it seemed to him, had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her <b>fingers</b> strayed <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, he softened, and kissed her with real affection. There were {{tears in his eyes}} as he went downstairs.|$|R
60|$|The sun was {{beginning}} to send dwarf shadows toward the east {{when he reached the}} Gulch. Here a new trepidation seized him. How would his partners receive the news of his utter failure? HE was happy, for he had gained Kitty through it. But they? For a moment {{it seemed to him that}} he had purchased <b>his</b> happiness <b>through</b> their loss. He stopped, took off his hat, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> remorsefully <b>through</b> <b>his</b> damp curls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor, dear head." [...] She {{reached up}} a hand and passed the <b>fingers</b> soothingly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. [...] "Let it go around no more. Let us begin anew, now. I loved you all the time. I know that I was weak in {{yielding}} to my mother's will. I should not have done so. Yet I have heard you speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind. Extend that charity to me. I acted mistakenly. Forgive me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} said that other was the road to Butterfield," [...] said he, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> shaggy {{whiskers}} in a puzzled way.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hay Denver ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> grizzled hair. [...] "It {{was when}} you came back in the Antelope, just before you got your step." ...|$|E
60|$|Philip waited. Mr. Perkins ran his lean <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{beard and}} looked at Philip. He seemed to be {{thinking}} over {{what he wanted to}} say.|$|E
6000|$|... "He disapproves of it, of course--strongly, perhaps. Well, {{though my}} dear girl {{is worthy of}} any station; and a man like me, devoted to mercantile interests, may hold his head up {{anywhere}} {{as one of the}} props of this commercial country," [...] (he ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> rapidly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, and tried to look independent), [...] "still I am prepared to admit, under all the circumstances--I say under all the circumstances--that his disapproval is very natural, and was very much to be expected--very much indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{down toward}} her. She linked her <b>fingers</b> {{together}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> left arm, and, leaning a little heavily upon him, began the ascent. He {{was conscious of}} some subtle fragrance from her clothes, a perfume strangely different from the odor of the ghostlike flowers that bordered the steep path up which they were climbing. Her arms, slight, warm things though they were, and great though his own strength, felt suddenly like a yoke. At every step he seemed to feel their weight more insistent--a weight not physical, solely due to this rush of unexpected emotions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye don't," [...] said Bill, {{raising his}} head, {{with a sudden}} twinkle in his eyes. [...] "Then ye don't know Snapshot Harry. Do ye suppose he's goin' {{to sit down and}} twiddle his thumbs with that skin game played on him? No, sir," [...] he continued, with a {{thoughtful}} deliberation, drawing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> slowly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> long beard, [...] "he spotted it--and smelt out the whole trick ez soon ez he opened that box, and that's why he didn't foller us! He'll hunt those sneak thieves into h-ll but what he'll get 'em, and," [...] he went on still more slowly, [...] "by the livin' hokey! I reckon, sonny, that's jest how ye'll get your chance to chip in!" ...|$|R
