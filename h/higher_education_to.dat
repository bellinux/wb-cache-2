25|$|The {{failure of}} many private {{universities}} and other {{higher education institutions}} in providing <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>to</b> students due to generalized lack of quality and rigour {{has also been a}} major problem - for several years those institutions were awarding degrees to thousands of people who were spread into the economically active population. Some higher education institutions, in particular from the private and polytechnic sector, have been regarded as true diploma mills. In the following decades after their creation in the 1970s and 1980s, the polytechnic institutions didn't assume their specific role as tertiary education vocational schools, which were created to award practical diplomas in more technical or basic fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, {{had been in}} vogue in urban settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>to</b> abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it {{was seen as a}} way to accomplish the needed expansion {{and at the same time}} give the campus a new image. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.|$|E
