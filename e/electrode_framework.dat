40|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy (STM) {{of single}} molecules has become a prominent experimental method {{in the field of}} molecular electronics. It has been found that in STM experiments, when an electric current flows through a single molecule, the molecule may luminesce. This electroluminescence, in conjunction with traditional STM data, provides a potentially important additional degree of freedom for understanding nanoscale systems. This thesis describes exploratory theoretical work on the newly emerging phenomenon of molecular electroluminescence, and its relationship to the {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} of single molecules. A local <b>electrode</b> <b>framework</b> is progressively developed, in order to explain single-molecule electroluminescence data as well as simulating STM current-voltage characteristics and topographic maps for molecules on complex substrates. The molecule Zn(II) -etioporphyrin I is chosen for detailed analysis and comparison with experiment. Electron transport is studied using Landauer theory that relates electric current to the transmission probability for an electron to scatter through the molecule. The theoretical approach utilizes tight binding and extended Huckel approaches for the electrodes and molecule, a charge-conserving scheme to self-consistently model the influence of electric fields and electric currents on the molecular energy level structure, and Fermi 2 ̆ 7 s golden rule in calculating electroluminescence. A single coherent framework is ultimately achieved that explains for the first time both the electric current data and molecular electroluminescence in a molecular system and elucidates the physics underlying a rich and previously puzzling array of interlinked optical and transport phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Recently, we have {{proposed}} a spin quantum cross structure (SQCS) device toward the realization of novel switching devices. The SQCS device consists of two ferromagneticmetalthin films with their edges facing each other at an angle of θ, and sandwiches a few molecules and atoms. In this paper, the calculation of electronic transport has been performed for SQCS devices with the Ni noncollinear magnetic films as both <b>electrodes</b> within the <b>framework</b> of the Anderson Hamiltonian, taking into consideration both polar angle θ, and azimuthal angle ϕ. We have obtained the general noncollinear spin transport formula, and the polar angle dependence of current-voltage characteristics of SQCS devices. The noncollinear spin transport is determined only by the angle θ defined by the inner product of two spins. Also, it is implied that SQCS devices can serve as multivalued memory devices by varying the angle θ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{summarizes}} {{the correlations between}} 2 D and 3 D microstructural properties of SOFC <b>electrodes</b> within the <b>framework</b> of stereology. 3 D geometrical properties, such as the mean particle diameter, the pore size, the specific surface area and the three-phase boundary density are correlated by simple relations to 2 D properties evaluated in a cross section, such as the mean diameter of the sectioned particles, the mean chord length, the particle perimeter exposed to the porous phase {{and the number of}} three-phase boundary points per unit area, respectively. The strong correlation between 2 D and 3 D properties predicted by stereological relations is verified by using packing algorithms {{in a wide range of}} porosity, particle size and electrode composition.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a spin quantum cross structure (SQCS) device as a candidate beyond CMOS. The SQCS device consists of two ferromagnetic metal thin films with their edges crossed, and sandwiches a few atoms or molecules. In this work, the spin dependent transport formula has been derived for SQCS devices with collinear ferromagnetic <b>electrodes</b> within the <b>framework</b> of the Anderson Hamiltonian. Also, the calculation of the magnetoresistance (MR) ratio has been done {{as a function of}} renormalized transfer matrices including magnetostriction effects and the other effects phenomenologically.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the determination of two critical constitutive properties for mass transport of ions through porous electrodes saturated with a liquid electrolyte solution. One is the effective diffusivity that is required to model the mass transport at the representative element volume (REV) level of porous <b>electrodes</b> in the <b>framework</b> of Darcy's law, while the other is the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient for modeling the mass transport from the REV level to the solid surfaces of pores induced by redox reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of mass transport through the electrodes of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), unique experimental setups for electrochemically determining the two transport properties by measuring limiting current densities are devised. The effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient through the porous electrode made of graphite felt, a typical material for VRFB electrodes, are measured at different electrolyte flow rates. The correlation equations, respectively, for the effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient are finally proposed based on the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{insertion}} of lithium into the Cr 2 (SO 4) 3 framework {{was carried out}} in a “Li∣LiClO 4 :EC–PC (3 : 1) ∣cathode” cylindrical cell (EC: ethylene carbonate, PC: propylene carbonate). Preliminary electrochemical data revealed that the Cr 2 (SO 4) 3 sample exhibit poor performance compared to the cation- and polyanion-substituted samples. Depending on the cation (Nb) substitution {{and the nature of the}} polyanion (XO 4) (X=P and S) : (a) a clear dependence of the shape of the discharge curve versus capacity; and (b) an enhancement of voltage and capacity rate have been obtained and their difference is discussed in terms of redox potential. The cathodes with Nb substitution and polyanion having (PO 4) 3 − are more tolerant to repeated lithium insertion and extraction than a standard Cr 2 (SO 4) 3 <b>framework</b> <b>electrode</b> in spite of a small reduction in the open-circuit voltage.

40|$|The {{recently}} observed Seebeck spin tunneling, the thermoelectric analog of spin-polarized tunneling, is described. The fundamental origin is {{the spin}} {{dependence of the}} Seebeck coefficient of a tunnel junction {{with at least one}} ferromagnetic electrode. Seebeck spin tunneling creates a thermal flow of spin-angular momentum across a tunnel barrier without a charge tunnel current. In ferromagnet/insulator/semiconductor tunnel junctions this can be used to induce a spin accumulation (Δμ) in the semiconductor in response to a temperature difference (Δ T) between the <b>electrodes.</b> A phenomenological <b>framework</b> is presented to describe the thermal spin transport in terms of parameters that can be obtained from experiment or theory. Key ingredients are a spin-polarized thermoelectric tunnel conductance and a tunnel spin polarization with non-zero energy derivative, resulting in different Seebeck tunnel coefficients for majority and minority spin electrons. We evaluate the thermal spin current, the induced spin accumulation and Δμ/Δ T, discuss limiting regimes, and compare thermal and electrical flow of spin across a tunnel barrier. A salient feature is that the thermally-induced spin accumulation is maximal for smaller tunnel resistance, in contrast to the electrically-induced spin accumulation that suffers from the impedance mismatch between a ferromagnetic metal and a semiconductor. The thermally-induced spin accumulation produces an additional thermovoltage proportional to Δμ, which can significantly enhance the conventional charge thermopower. Owing to the Hanle effect, the thermopower can also be manipulated with a magnetic field, producing a Hanle magnetothermopower. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{signals are}} {{recorded}} from various {{regions of the}} brain and are analysed to understand the working mechanism of neurons and how they interpret external environment. The aim is to understand how this nature's supercomputer works. This helps in exploring human systems and intelligence, treat mental conditions and develop smart machines. Neural data recordings are collected from individual neurons and from populations of neurons. The single neuronal activity recordings are spike train and the activity generated from multiple neurons are field potentials. The data obtained are in enormous amount and of millisecond precision, as a consequence their processing is not a trivial task and efficient techniques are required for decoding these datasets. This work proposes several methods for the analysis of spike train and field potentials. A self-organising map based clustering is applied to synchronous spike train and generates topographically ordered and information-preserving clusters that help interpret how stimuli features are encoded by the neurons. An information-coupled empirical mode decomposition framework is developed for field potentials. It extracts informative oscillatory functions and information coding frequency bands in the recordings. This has several applications. The informative modes reveal underlying neuronal activities w. r. t stimuli, which otherwise have to be extracted by bandpass filters, followed by Fourier or wavelets analysis. It {{can also be used to}} analyse neuronal population activity under a medical condition or to understand neuronal interactions by information-connectivity analysis among <b>electrodes.</b> The proposed <b>framework</b> is developed into the form of a toolbox which can be used for educational and research purposes.

40|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) {{are limited}} in their applicability in everyday settings by the current necessity to record subject-specific calibration data prior to actual use of the BCI for communication. In this work, we utilize the framework of multitask learning to construct a BCI {{that can be used}} without any subject-specific calibration process, i. e., with zero training data. In BCIs based on EEG or MEG, the predictive function of a subject's intention is commonly modeled as a linear combination of some features derived from spatial and spectral recordings. The coefficients of this combination correspond to the importance of the features for predicting the intention of the subject. These coefficients are usually learned separately for each subject due to inter-subject variability. Principle feature characteristics, however, are known to remain invariant across subject. For example, {{it is well known that}} in motor imagery paradigms spectral power in the mu- and beta frequency ranges (roughly 8 - 14 Hz and 20 - 30 Hz, respectively) over sensorimotor areas provides most information on a subject's intention. Based on this assumption, we define the intention prediction function as a combination of subject-invariant and subject-specific models, and propose a machine learning method that infers these models jointly using data from multiple subjects. This framework leads to an out-of-the-box intention predictor, where the subject-invariant model can be employed immediately for a subject with no prior data. We present a computationally efficient method to further improve this BCI to incorporate subject-specific variations as such data becomes available. To overcome the problem of high dimensional feature spaces in this context, we further present a new method for finding the relevance of different recording channels according to actions performed by subjects. Usually, the BCI feature representation is a concatenation of spectral features extracted from different channels. This representation, however, is redundant, as recording channels at different spatial locations typically measure overlapping sources within the brain due to volume conduction. We address this problem by assuming that the relevance of different spectral bands is invariant across channels, while learning different weights for each recording <b>electrode.</b> This <b>framework</b> allows us to significantly reduce the feature space dimensionality without discarding potentially useful information. Furthermore, the resulting out-of-the-box BCI can be adapted to different experimental setups, for example EEG caps with different numbers of channels, as long as there exists a mapping across channels in different setups. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a set of experimental EEG data recorded during a standard two-class motor imagery paradigm from a total of ten healthy subjects. Specifically, we show that satisfactory classification results can be achieved with zero training data, and that combining prior recordings with subject-specific calibration data substantially outperforms using subject-specific data only...|$|R
