40|$|<b>Interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> are an {{integral}} part of the recreational opportunities provided at parks, at both the state and federal levels. Commonly led by the Park Naturalist or Interpreter, <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> are a great way for visitors to connect with the park and its natural resources on a more personal level. While many <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> effectively involve visitors with the park, they often only strongly appeal to two very specific age groups: young children or senior citizens. Through a brief research paper and a series of <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> I designed specifically for Maumee Bay State Park in Ohio, I explore the significance of attracting more teens to parks, along with the ways in which park Naturalists and Interpreters can engage more teens in their programs. Focusing on teamwork and social interaction, channeling individualism and emphasizing independence and responsibility, this thesis expands upon how we can use these three elements to attract our future leaders to become more passionate about the environment and natural resources.
