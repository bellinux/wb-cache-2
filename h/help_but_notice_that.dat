60|$|This finished, {{our hero}} found he was hungry, {{and after a}} washing-up, ate supper with a relish.

50|$|The {{heads of}} the Lupertazzi and DiMeo {{families}} meet to discuss the removal of asbestos from a building project. Tony rejects Phil's demand of a 25% cut of {{the money from the}} illegal dumping. While driving Tony home, Christopher is agitated and repeatedly changes the radio station, finally settling for a CD soundtrack of The Departed. As the road curves and Chris ups the stereo volume, he swerves into the opposite lane and swerves to avoid a car, causing his Cadillac Escalade EXT to go off the road and rollover. Tony suffers minor injuries, but Chris is seriously injured and has difficulty breathing. He tells Tony he will not pass the drug test. Tony begins to call for <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> after <b>noticing</b> <b>that</b> a tree branch has impaled Christopher's vehicle directly where his daughter would have been seated had she been in it, Tony suffocates him before calling an ambulance. At the hospital, he leads the staff and his family to believe that Chris died from the crash.|$|R

Abbas says his brother is innocent and has no links with terrorism; [...] "To {{the best of my}} knowledge, these charges are false. I know my brother. I love my brother. He’s a man of integrity, he’s honest, and he’s a hard-working person."Rana's arrest had a devastating impact on the family.

30|$|One cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> with {{interest}} <b>that</b> {{today it is}} Malinowski’s concept of context, perhaps strengthened as needed with ideas from Halliday’s SFL, that supports the drive towards the multimodal ‘text’ analyses highly popular. Halliday’s method for bringing order to the chaos of situation was {{to focus on the}} ‘speech event’ without either ignoring or privileging the extra-linguistic information. SFL is widely viewed today as friendly to text analysis, especially where the concern is with linguistic meaning-wording. In contrast to these two frames, Firth’s account falls in the middle: it rejects Malinowski’s ‘instance-based’ ‘holistic’ view of the context of situation, and it fails to foreground the specificity of the linguistic analysis of ‘speech events’. Not many practitioners of SFL use Firth’s inspiringly rich but sprawling and sometimes contradictory framework for the contextual analysis of meaning either as instance or as systemb. Often, even linguists announcing a Firthian orientation, will ‘elaborate’ Firth’s ideas typically in terms of Halliday’s methods for register analysis.|$|R

5000|$|On the ice, Gretzky {{switched}} from Titan's wooden hockey stick to Easton's aluminum model. Barnett convinced Chairman Jim Easton {{to create a}} bright, new, chrome aluminum shaft {{that would be used}} exclusively by Gretzky in NHL action.

Rick warns that they need to conserve their ammunition, which is more precious than the stranger's life. They leave the man to be consumed by the walkers and run back to the tracks.|$|E

Rajeev and Reena's parents decide to get them married as soon as possible. Here, Maddy goes into depression and starts drinking. Reena is no better off without him either, as she finds it very difficult to forget him. Though the enmity between Sam and Maddy is renewed, Sam cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> Reena is marrying him only because she is mad at Maddy.|$|E
50|$|Min-joo {{is a hard}} worker. She {{believes}} in justice, respect, and that {{if you work hard}} at your dreams they will come true. This is exactly how she became a news announcer at JBC. After almost failing the exam/interview twice she finally gets her hand at being a reporter. While her true dream is to become a news anchor, she can't believe her luck when she is given this chance while on assignment.

5000|$|Stories are an inextricable part {{of living}} in the estate and are shared by {{characters}} of Osiedle Swobda all the time. Therefore telling them grows into the local art, the best raconteur - like the ones in tribes - is an extremely important member of “tribal” hierarchy. On the other hand one could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> tales embellish characters’ lives. Although, they seem to embark on their own adventures the longing for something more is still detectable. These urban legends are often produced {{under the influence of alcohol}} and so called [...] "magical element". Through colorful stories characters escape from the grey reality but in time this escape becomes their entire live. What is left after sobering up are depressing hangover and disappointed parents who possess no authority and are constantly absent.|$|E

50|$|Leading {{businesses}} in Brazil are highlighting opportunities across social and mobile in Brazil. Exclusive data from IAB Brazil also signals that Internet advertising including search is growing strong, together accounting for 10% of total media advertising in 2011. The digital landscape is fluctuating quickly. In comparison to markets where similar {{changes have been}} on-going for the past 10 years, one cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> it seems like, for Brazil, everything is happening at once. This is a notion reflected by Brazilian digital marketing expert, Nino Carvalho, who specialises in strategic planning and training in communication. While highlighting that multimedia content should be particularly relevant to any new campaign, he argues that newer agencies may also benefit from a ‘back-to-basics’ approach. The “BIG” opportunity is as dull and obvious as doing marketing right. Plain and simple: delivering good services, listening to your customer, monitoring competition, then actually using all that to enhance your offers to clients.|$|E

5000|$|During [...] "In the Eye Abides the Heart", the Liars are {{gathered}} at the Brew discussing Pastor Ted’s mysterious photo of Charlotte and Lucas. Together, they wonder if Gottesman and Charlotte managed {{to stay in touch}} throughout the years. The girls decide to search Lucas’s loft in an attempt to obtain answers, but Aria points out that the entire building could be bugged, considering his affinity for high-tech gadgets. Later, Emily and Hanna commence their search through Lucas’s apartment. Hanna is quick to defend her friend, but while rummaging through a box of comic books, the two Liars come across a manila envelope tucked all the way in the back. Hanna reaches inside and pulls out another comic titled Arcturus. The author signatures at the bottom catches their eye, which reveal that it was conceived by Lucas and Charlotte. Aria soon joins Emily and Hanna, and they inspect the comic together. The content seems to be about a troubled boy who befriends a woman from outer space with magical powers. Together, they seek vengeance upon people who have hurt him. The girls can’t <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> there are some eerily familiar drawings that resemble the electrical switches from Charlotte's Dollhouse. Almost immediately after this uncovering, Aria is seen on her phone, telling A.D. all about the comic through FaceTime. Back at the loft, Hanna pulls out the box where she previously found Lucas’s mysterious comic, only to realize that it’s missing. Aria is then seen bringing the comic to Rosewood High {{in the middle of the}} night. Her mission is to place the book in locker 214. Just as she starts to walk away after doing so, Aria appears to have a change of heart. She immediately doubles back to the locker, only to find a black hoodie hanging from the hook in its place. Near the end of the episode, Ezra spots Spencer at the airport with Wren Kingston. She immediately gets up and walks over to Ezra to quickly introduce him to her ex-boyfriend. Spencer then pulls Ezra off to the side and explains to him that she hasn't spoken to Kingston since before Charlotte's homicide. She met up with Wren in order to seek for enlightenment on his behalf about her half-sister given that he helped her sneak in and out of Radley.|$|E

Spencer visits Marco at the police station to bring him a box of cupcakes and make small talk about Archer's severed finger that A.D. sent the authorities. Furey reveals that he spoke with a nurse at Welby and learned that Mary and Archer had an argument right before he went missing. Marco deduces that Drake might have been involved in Archer’s murder, but his suspicions also lean towards Spencer. When Spencer returns home later that day, she immediately realizes that someone trespassed her house. Sure enough, the front door to the barn is ajar and a bottle is poised in front of it, with a note sticking out at the top. She unravels it quickly, only to reveal a message from Mary that states “Need to talk.” Spencer writes a response and sticks the paper back inside the bottle. The following day, Hanna pulls out the box where she previously found Lucas’s mysterious comic book he wrote with Charlotte, only to realize that it’s missing. Hanna immediately dials Spencer to inform her, but she dismisses her quickly in favor of opening up the latest note from Drake, which contains a single gold key. At night, Spencer unlocks a door at the Lost Woods Resort and stumbles upon a pile of mail right at the foot of the doorway. Suddenly, she hears a noise outside, and Furey walks in. He divulges to have followed her, realizing that Spencer was planning on meeting Mary at the motel. Marco shares that every theory he has about Dunhill’s death somehow links back to Spencer and the other Liars. To make matters worse, Furey discloses that he ordered copies of Archer’s paper receipts to inspect the signature. Spencer immediately realizes that she accidentally used Archer’s credit card to pay for the drinks that she and Marco shared that night. Spencer proceeds to exit the Lost Woods abruptly. At the end of the episode, she receives one more note from Drake that says [...] "You brought the police. I understand. Goodbye." [...] It turns out that Mary waited for her daughter at the resort but when she spotted Furey, she assumed Spencer had tipped him off. Near the end of the episode, Ezra spots Spencer at the airport with Wren Kingston. She immediately gets up and walks over to Ezra to quickly introduce him to her ex-boyfriend. Spencer then pulls Ezra off to the side and explains to him that she hasn't spoken to Kingston since before Charlotte's homicide. She met up with Wren in order to seek for enlightenment on his behalf given that he helped her former tormentor sneak in and out of Radley. Mona is enlisted by Hanna to investigate the Liar's Lament board game after disclosing that Lucas canceled her friend's fashion business ahead of its release. Mona gets fascinated by the game's structure, and starts taking photos of the building. Hanna instigates Mona to play the game to find out how far [...] "A.D." [...] would go, but Mona insists she may end up getting addicted again in the process. Hanna is, however, able to convince her to play, stating that Mona will feel good when she realizes that she has defeated the stalker. Outside of town, Ezra is at the airport waiting for his flight when he sees Spencer and Wren Kingston talking. She immediately gets up and walks over to Ezra to quickly introduce him to her ex-boyfriend. Spencer then pulls Ezra off to the side and explains to him that she hasn't spoken to Kingston since before Charlotte's homicide. She met up with Wren in order to seek for enlightenment on his behalf given that he helped her former tormentor sneak in and out of Radley.|$|E
