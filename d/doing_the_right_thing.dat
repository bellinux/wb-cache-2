25|$|Bhakti yoga is one {{of three}} yoga taught in Bhagavad Gita. Bhakti yoga is, {{according}} to Peter Bishop, a devotee's loving devotion to a personal god as the path for spirituality.

Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.|$|E

500|$|Nier is {{intended}} to be set over 1000 years after the events of Drakengards fifth ending. In this scenario, the game's protagonists Caim and Angelus travel across a dimensional boundary to fight a monstrous beast. After winning the battle and killing the monster, they are shot down by a fighter jet and killed; their introduction of magic to the world leads to magical research that results in the Black Scrawl. According to Yoko, after the dark story of Drakengard, Yoko focused on more positive themes of friendship and combined effort. Much of the game was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the War on Terror. Yoko took from it the idea of a terrible event where both sides believed they were <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing,</b> and wanted to show the player multiple perspectives of the same events. The term [...] "Replicant" [...] was borrowed by Yoko from the 1982 science fiction movie Blade Runner, although Yoko did not cite a particular source for Nier's name, passing it off as a codename that persisted through development.|$|E
