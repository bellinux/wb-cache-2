Boot and shoe making which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and glove. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and <b>footwear</b> <b>manufacture</b> became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and balloons (B-Loony).|$|E

40|$|A new, continuously-monitoring {{portable}} device that monitors the diabetic foot has shown {{to help in}} reduction of diabetic foot complications. Persons affected by diabetic foot have shown to be particularly sensitive in the plantar surface; this sensitivity coupled with certain ambient conditions may cause dry skin. This dry skin leads {{to the formation of}} fissures that may eventually result in a foot ulceration and subsequent hospitalization. This new device monitors the micro-climate temperature and humidity areas between the insole and sole of the footwear. The monitoring system consists of an array of ten sensors that take readings of relative humidity within the range of 100 % ± 2 % and temperature within the range of − 40 °C to 123. 8 ± 0. 3 °C. Continuous data is collected using embedded C software and the recorded data is processed in Matlab. This allows for the display of data; the implementation of the iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm method was used to display an exponential response curve. Therefore, the aim of our system is to obtain feedback data and provide the critical information to various footwear manufacturers. The <b>footwear</b> <b>manufactures</b> will utilize this critical information to design and <b>manufacture</b> diabetic <b>footwear</b> that reduce the risk of ulcers in diabetic feet...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional {{point cloud}} data of a foot {{are used to}} {{determine}} the critical dimensions for making custom footwear. However, automatic and accurate measurement of dimensions, especially girths, is an issue of concern to many designers and footwear developers. Existing methods for measuring girths are primarily based on points or generated triangles, but their accuracy is heavily dependent on the density of the point cloud data. In this paper we present the use of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) surface modelling technique for measuring girths as it has the advantage of being able to operate on unorganised three-dimensional points, so that the generated surface passes through every scanned point, while repairing incomplete meshes. To overcome the high computational expense of the RBF method, local surface recovery, octree division and combination, inverse power method and improved Cholesky factorisation are used. The girth measurements obtained from adopting these approaches are compared against the existing measurement methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the local RBF implicit surface can provide more stable and accurate measurements using relatively less time, proving its value in custom <b>footwear</b> <b>manufacture.</b> close 2...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of foreign outsourcing, focusing on CEE countries and especially on Turkey, on the level of employment for Spain. The rising economic integration has increased not only trade in final goods but also the flows of intermediate goods, as a result of the fragmentation of production by multinational firms and/or the search for new and cheaper providers. While some see this phenomenon as a threat to domestic employment, it also represents a chance to reduce costs, increase flexibility and open new markets, all of which can raise sales and employment. We study empirically this impact for Spain, a country that joined the EEC in 1986, becoming a low-cost location for many firms, and after twenty-years of development it is now experiencing a strong increase of outsourcing to Central and Eastern European countries with a specific analysis of the case of Turkey. The trade relationship between Turkey and Spain has been reinforced significantly in the last years and has concentrated in a few sectors, with important relative increase in imports from particular sectors as Agriculture, Textile, Leather goods, Manufacture of <b>footwear,</b> <b>Manufacture</b> of cork and wood, Manufacture of articles of paper and cardboard, Manufacture of rubber and plastic products...|$|E
40|$|The intension of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the industrial highlights and strengths of the East Midlands region, both at the regional and local administrative area level. In addition, representative companies of each highlighted industry were identified. The purpose of this information was to help inform and assist a regional Venture Capital Fund (East Midlands Early Growth Fund) in their deal generation and assessment activities. This cross-sectional survey used three sources of data: 1. 	Employment data statistics were used to identify industrial highlights. 2. 	A company report database was used to generate a list of companies present within each industrial highlight. 3. 	A survey of local economic development professionals cross referenced secondary sources as well as provided additional information. Industrial highlights or strengths were identified for the East Midlands Region and all 40 constituent areas along with a number of exemplar companies. Analysis of the geographical distribution of these strengths identified some agglomerations of industries that may be indicative of the presence of clusters: 1. 	Agricultural cluster centred in Lincolnshire with specific strengths in poultry and Fruit & Vegetable production and processing. 2. 	Food processing, located across the region 3. 	Plastics manufacture around Nottingham and Corby/ Rutland. 4. 	Textiles, with specific strengths in <b>footwear</b> <b>manufacture</b> in Northamptonshire, and kitted and crocheted fabric around Leicester and Ashfield/ Amber Valley. 5. 	Furniture manufacture, particularly production of seats and chairs to the west of the City of Nottingham (Erewash). 6. 	Construction, with highlights in concrete manufacture. 7.

30|$|With {{this high}} risk of injury with running activity, {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in interest in barefoot running over the last decade [3, 4]. The interest is largely due to anecdotal claims that this footwear modality is more natural and can therefore reduce injuries that may be caused by conventional running shoes (CRS) [5, 6]. With this increase in interest in barefoot running, <b>footwear</b> <b>manufactures</b> now produce minimal footwear that are marketed as having reduced conventional properties of the shoe such as stiffness, stack height, and shoe drop. Many runners are now attempting to switch to a more minimal running condition [4], and therefore have to undergo a transition to this footwear type. Injury risk may increase {{as a result of the}} transition because MFW lacks the conventional footwear properties of which the runner is now accustomed [7 – 9]. Runners attempting to transition to MFW must either adapt their running kinematics to suit a novel footwear condition or adapt the musculoskeletal system in order to accommodate different forces acting on the body due to changes in leg geometry/loading and footwear protection. The success and methods of how habitually shod runners can transition to MFW remain to be determined, but there is a growing body of literature that has investigated this problem (e.g. [8, 10, 11]).|$|R
40|$|Este artigo apresenta um método para a medição do tempo de atravessamento e do inventário em processo em manufatura. A medição foi usada em processo de controle organizacional de manufatura, cuja variável controlada foi o tempo de atravessamento de ordens. Tal controle pode ser útil em estratégias de manufatura em que a competição é baseada no uso do tempo, a TBC (time-based competition). Apresentou-se o método de medição, que inclui elementos da teoria das filas, e considerações para a simplificação de arranjos produtivos de manufatura. Para testar e refinar o método, estudou-se um caso em manufatura calçadista.
