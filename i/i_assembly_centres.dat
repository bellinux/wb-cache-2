40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Disturbances in the {{mitochondrial}} {{oxidative phosphorylation}} pathway most {{often lead to}} devastating disorders with a fatal outcome. Of these, complex I deficiency is the most frequently encountered. Recent characterization of the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA-encoded complex I subunits has allowed mutational analysis and reliable prenatal diagnosis. Nevertheless, complex-I-deficient patients without a mutation {{in any of the}} known subunits remain. It is assumed that these patients harbour defects in proteins involved in the assembly of this largest member of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. This review describes current understanding of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly,</b> new developments and future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: The first model of human complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> has been proposed recently. New insights into supercomplex assembly and stability may help to explain combined deficiencies. Recent functional characterization of some of the 32 accessory subunits of the complex may link these subunits to complex I biogenesis and activity regulation. SUMMARY: Research on complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> is increasing rapidly. However, comparison between theoretical and experimental models of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> is still problematic. The growing understanding of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> at the subunit and supercomplex level will clarify the picture in the future. The elucidation of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly,</b> by combining patient data with new experimental methods, will facilitate the diagnosis of (and possibly therapy for) many uncharacterized mitochondrial disorders...|$|R

40|$|Defects in {{mitochondrial}} electron {{transport chain}} (ETC) function have {{been implicated in}} a number of neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and aging. Mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is the largest and most complicated enzyme of the ETC with 45 subunits originating from two separate genomes. The biogenesis of complex I is an intricate process that requires multiple steps, subassemblies, and assembly factors. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a Drosophila model of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> factor deficiency. We show that CG 7598 (dCIA 30), the Drosophila homolog of human complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> factor Ndufaf 1, is necessary for proper complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly.</b> Reduced expression of dCIA 30 results in the loss of the complex I holoenzyme band in blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and loss of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in isolated mitochondria. The complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> defect, caused by mutation or RNAi of dCIA 30, has repercussions both during development and adulthood in Drosophila, including developmental arrest at the pupal stage and reduced stress resistance during adulthood. Expression of the single-subunit yeast alternative NADH dehydrogenase, Ndi 1, can partially or wholly rescue phenotypes associated with the complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> defect. Ou...|$|R

40|$|Mitochondrial {{function}} {{is an important}} determinant of the ageing process; however, the mitochondrial properties that enable longevity are not well understood. Here we show that optimal assembly of mitochondrial complex I predicts longevity in mice. Using an unbiased high-coverage high-confidence approach, we demonstrate that electron transport chain proteins, especially the matrix arm subunits of complex I, are decreased in young long-living mice, which is associated with improved complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly,</b> higher complex I-linked state 3 oxygen consumption rates and decreased superoxide production, whereas the opposite is seen in old mice. Disruption of complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> reduces oxidative metabolism with concomitant increase in mitochondrial superoxide production. This is rescued by knockdown of the mitochondrial chaperone, prohibitin. Disrupted complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> causes premature senescence in primary cells. We propose that lower abundance of free catalytic complex I components supports complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly,</b> efficacy of substrate utilization and minimal ROS production, enabling enhanced longevity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRespiratory Complex I {{deficiency}} is {{implicated in}} numerous degenerative and metabolic diseases. In particular, mutations in several mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) -encoded Complex I subunits including ND 4, ND 5 and ND 6 {{have been identified}} in several neurological diseases. We previously demonstrated that these subunits played essential roles in Complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> which in turn affected mitochondrial function. Here, we carried out a comprehensive study of the Complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> pathway. We identified a new Complex I intermediate containing both membrane and matrix arms at an early assembly stage. We find that lack of the ND 6 subunit does not hinder membrane arm formation; instead it recruits ND 1 and ND 5 enters the intermediate. While ND 4 is important for the formation of the newly identified intermediate, the addition of ND 5 stabilizes the complex and is required for the critical transition from Complex <b>I</b> to supercomplex <b>assembly.</b> As a result, the Complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> pathway has been redefined in this study...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{that the absence of}} expression of products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) during early development might allow the fetus to escape recognition by maternal lymphocytes. In addition to the MHC class I heavy chain and beta 2 -microglobulin, antigenic peptide is an essential structural component of the class I molecule. Indeed, there is evidence that MHC-linked genes encoding peptide transporter molecules and possibly components of a proteolytic complex are necessary for MHC class <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> and stability at the cell surface. Here we demonstrate that embryonic cells in general show a defect in MHC class <b>I</b> <b>assembly.</b> Surface expression was rescued in the presence of an appropriate antigenic peptide, or by treatment with interferon. Consistent with this, HAM 1 messenger RNA was not constitutively expressed, but was inducible by interferon, and during differentiation in vitro.

40|$|Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is {{the largest}} multiprotein enzyme of the {{oxidative}} phosphorylation system. Its assembly in human cells is poorly understood and no proteins assisting this process have yet been described. A good candidate is NDUFAF 1, the human homologue of Neurospora crassa complex I chaperone CIA 30. Here, we demonstrate that NDUFAF 1 is a mitochondrial protein that {{is involved in the}} complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> process. Modulating the intramitochondrial amount of NDUFAF 1 by knocking down its expression using RNA interference leads to a reduced amount and activity of complex I. NDUFAF 1 is associated to two complexes of 600 and 700 kDa in size of which the relative distribution is altered in two complex I deficient patients. Analysis of NDUFAF 1 expression in a conditional complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> system shows that the 700 kDa complex may represent a key step in the complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> process. Based on these data, we propose that NDUFAF 1 is an important protein for the assembly/stability of complex I...|$|R

40|$|In humans, complex I of the {{respiratory}} chain {{is composed of}} seven mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) -encoded and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits that assemble together {{in a process that}} is poorly defined. To date, only two complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> factors have been identified and how each functions is not clear. Here, we show that the human complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> factor CIA 30 (complex I intermediate associated protein) associates with newly translated mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits at early stages in their assembly before dissociating at a later stage. Using antibodies we identified a CIA 30 -deficient patient who presented with cardioencephalomyopathy and reduced levels and activity of complex I. Genetic analysis revealed the patient had mutations in both alleles of the NDUFAF 1 gene that encodes CIA 30. Complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> in patient cells was defective at early stages with subunits being degraded. Complementing the deficiency in patient fibroblasts with normal CIA 30 using a novel lentiviral system restored steady-state complex I levels. Our results indicate that CIA 30 is a crucial component in the early <b>assembly</b> of complex <b>I</b> and mutations in its gene can cause mitochondrial disease...|$|R
40|$|Complex Iof the {{mitochondrial}} respiratory {{chain is}} a large multisubunit enzymethat assembles from nuclear and mtDNA-encoded components. Several complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> factors have been identified, but their precise functions are not well understood. Here, we have investigated the function of one of these, NDUFAF 7, a soluble matrix protein comprised of a DUF 185 domain that harbors a methyltransferase motif. Knockdown of NDUFAF 7 by siRNA in human fibroblasts produced a specific complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> defect, as did morpholino-mediated knockdown of the zebrafish ortholog. Germline disruption of the murine ortholog was an early embryonic lethal. The complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> defect was characterized by rapid, AFG 3 L 2 -dependent, turnover of newly syn-thesized ND 1, the subunit that seeds the assembly pathway, and by decreased steady-state levels of several other structural subunits including NDUFS 2, NDUFS 1 and NDUFA 9. Expression of an NDUFAF 7 mutant (G 124 V), predicted to disrupt methyltransferase activity, impaired complex <b>I</b> <b>assembly,</b> suggesting an assembly factor or structural subunit as a substrate for methylation. To identify the NDUFAF 7 substrate, we used an anti-ND 1 antibody to immunoprecipitate complex I and its associated assembly factors, followed by mass spectrometry to detect posttranslational protein modifications. Analysis of an NDUFAF 7 methyltransferase mutant showed a 10 -fold reduction in an NDUFS 2 peptide containing dimethylated Arg 85, but a 5 -fold reduction in three other NDUFS 2 peptides. These results show that NDUFAF 7 functions to methylate NDUFS 2 after it assembles into a complex I, stabilizing an early intermediate in the assembly pathway, and that this function is essential for normal vertebrate development...|$|R

40|$|To {{persist in}} the {{presence}} of an active immune system, viruses encode proteins that decrease expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules by using a variety of mechanisms. For example, murine gamma- 2 herpesvirus 68 expresses the K 3 protein, which causes the rapid turnover of nascent class I molecules. In this report we show that certain mouse class I alleles are more susceptible than others to K 3 -mediated down regulation. Prior to their rapid degradation, class I molecules in K 3 -expressing cells exhibit impaired assembly with β 2 -microglobulin. Furthermore, K 3 is detected predominantly in association with class <b>I</b> molecules lacking <b>assembly</b> with high-affinity peptides, including class I molecules associated with the peptide loading complex TAP/tapasin/calreticulin. The detection of K 3 with class <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> intermediates raises the possibility that molecular chaperones involved in class <b>I</b> <b>assembly</b> are involved in K 3 -mediated class I regulation...|$|R
