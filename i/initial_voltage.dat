50|$|The first {{potentiometric}} titration {{was carried out}} in 1893 by Robert Behrend at Ostwald's Institute in Leipzig.

He found that in a cell composed of mercurous nitrate and mercurous nitrate/mercury, the <b>initial</b> <b>voltage</b> is 0. If potassium chloride is added to mercurous nitrate on one side, mercury (I) chloride is precipitated. This decreased the osmotic pressure of mercury (I) ions on the side and creates a potential difference. This potential difference increases slowly as additional potassium chloride is added, but then increases more rapidly. He found the greatest potential difference is achieved once all of the mercurous nitrate has been precipitated. This was used to discern end points of titrations.|$|E
5000|$|Response time {{compensation}} {{is also known}} as [...] "Overdrive". LCDs moderate light flow by rotating liquid crystal molecules to various alignments where they transmit more or less light depending on the electrical setting at each individual pixel. The speed at which these liquid crystal molecules rotate is relatively slow, below the image refresh rate. As a consequence, when a scene is changing fast or there is a fast moving image being displayed (such as a golf ball flying off the head of a club) the object is at best blurry and can disappear from the image entirely. Overdrive attempts to compensate for this by, instead of sending the desired voltage to each pixel, it sends a higher <b>initial</b> <b>voltage</b> and then moderates that voltage in order to drive the rotation of the liquid crystal faster. Electrically it [...] "steps on the gas" [...] {{in order to get to}} the right speed quickly, then eases off as it approaches the desired performance level.|$|E

5000|$|The sampler/pulser circuit {{has three}} {{distinct}} operational states {{determined by the}} voltage level of the control signal, Control. The circuit transitions sequentially through all three states as the voltage level of the control signal, Control, falls from an <b>initial</b> <b>voltage</b> that {{is greater than the}} fixed input voltage V3, to the second state in which Control is between the voltage of the fixed input voltage V3 and the fixed voltage V2, to the third state in which Control's voltage is less than fixed voltage V2. Typically V2 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than voltage V1, and V3 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than V2. The control signal, Control, typically begins at a voltage level that is approximately the voltage level of Vdd, the power supply. The voltage level of Vdd is typically one to three volts higher than V3. At the time one desires to create a sampling aperture or pulse, the control signal is slewed in a negative direction, so that it ultimately ends up at a voltage that is less than V2. If the control signal is initially greater than V3 by more than a few tenths of a volt, transistor Q9 and Q10 are [...] "on" [...] (biased into the forward conduction region) and transistors Q7 and Q8 are [...] "off" [...] (biased so that essentially no current flows), resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, causing the sampling gate to be turned [...] "off" [...] (the output nodes contain no signal). Similarly, if the level of the control signal {{at the end of its}} falling transition is less than V2 by a few tenths of a volt, transistors Q11 and Q12 are [...] "on" [...] and transistors Q5 and Q6 are [...] "off", resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, and the sampling gate again being turned off.
