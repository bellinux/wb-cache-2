5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

40|$|Social {{surveys have}} {{established}} dose-response relationships between aircraft noise and annoyance, {{with a number}} of psychological symptoms being positively related to annoyance. Evidence that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise</b> is associated with higher psychiatric hospital admission rates is mixed. Some evidence exists of an association between aircraft noise exposure and use of psychotropic medications. People with a pre-existing psychological or psychiatric condition may be more susceptible to the effects of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise.</b> Aircraft noise can produce effects on electroencephalogram sleep patterns and cause wakefulness and difficulty in sleeping. Attendances at general practitioners, self-reported health problems and use of medications, have been associated with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise,</b> but some findings are inconsistent. Some association between aircraft noise exposure and elevated mean blood pressure has been observed in cross-sectional studies of schoolchildren, but with little confirmation from cohort studies. There is no convincing evidence to suggest that all-cause or cause-specific mortality is increased by <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise.</b> There is no strong evidence that aircraft noise has significant perinatal effects. Using the World Health Organization definition of health, which includes positive mental and social wellbeing, aircraft noise is responsible for considerable ill-health. However, population-based studies have not found strong evidence that people living near or under aircraft flight paths suffer higher rates of clinical morbidity or mortality as a consequence of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise.</b> A dearth of high quality studies in this area precludes drawing substantive conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Traffic {{noise is}} one of the main {{important}} sources in urban noise pollution, which causes various physiological and psychological effects that can cause disturbs in performance, sleep disturbances, hearing loss and impact on job performance. This study was conducted to verify the impact of road traffic noise on reaction time in terms of extraversion and sex. Methods: Traffic noise was measured and recorded in 10 arterial streets in Tehran, and then the rec­orded noise was emitted towards participants in an acoustic room. The participants were 80 (40 cases and 40 controls) students. Personality type was determined by Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) questioner. Reaction time before and after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> was measured. Results: Reaction time before <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> did not differ (P= 0. 437) significantly between introverts and extraverts. However, it was increased significantly in both groups after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traf­fic <b>noise</b> (P< 0. 01). Introvert’s reaction time was more increased than that of extraverts. Conclusion: Traffic noise augmented reaction time of both males and females. This study also re­vealed that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> leads <b>to</b> increase in reaction time...|$|R
50|$|Another {{factor that}} may not show signs of being harmful is the current {{workload}} of a person. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> greater than 95 dB in individuals with heavy workloads was shown to cause severe TTS. In addition, the workload was a driving factor {{in the amount of}} recovery time required to return threshold levels to their baselines.|$|E
50|$|Rock concerts {{are often}} {{performed}} {{at very high}} decibel levels. Prolonged <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> at these levels can permanently damage {{the bones of the}} middle ear and the nerves of the inner ear. Thus health officials recommend that concertgoers use earplugs. Since the 1960s, many musicians have worn earplugs at concerts, and some concert promoters actually give out free earplugs.|$|E
50|$|Administrative control, behind {{engineering}} control, is {{the next}} best form of prevention of noise exposure. They can either reduce the <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise,</b> or reduce the decibel level of the noise itself. Limiting {{the amount of time}} a worker is allowed to be around an unsafe level of noise exposure, and creating procedures for operation of equipment that could produce harmful levels of noise are both examples of administrative controls.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that hearing loss can be minimized by taking high doses of magnesium for a few days, starting {{as soon as possible}} after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the loud <b>noise.</b> A magnesium-high diet also seems to be helpful as an NIHL-preventative if taken in advance of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> loud <b>noises.</b> Consuming sizable amounts of magnesium can be potentially harmful, so this treatment should be followed with caution.|$|R
40|$|Hearing loss, most {{specifically}} noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) due <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> vuvuzela <b>noise,</b> received extended media coverage {{before and during}} the 2010 Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) soccer world cup tournament. This study aimed to evaluate the impact that this media coverage had on raising awareness about NIHL due <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> vuvuzela <b>noise</b> at soccer matches among South African soccer spectators. A descriptive survey study, using a 24 -item, self-administered questionnaire was used for this study. One hundred and forty seven (147) soccer spectators were surveyed before (N 1 = 73) and after (N 2 = 74) the tournament. Systematic sampling strategy was used to select the participants. Participants completed the questionnaire before the start of matches. Sixteen percent of the participants surveyed reported having had some media exposure about NIHL due <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> vuvuzela <b>noise</b> during soccer matches before the tournament in comparison to 26 % of the participants after the tournament. This increase in the level of awareness was not statistically significant. Further, most participants were still not aware of the risk of NIHL <b>to</b> them from <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> excessive <b>noise</b> during matches and did not consider hearing loss from noise exposure during soccer matches a serious concern {{both before and after the}} tournament. The results of this study therefore seem to suggest that vuvuzela media coverage during the 2010 FIFA soccer world cup tournament did not significantly raise the level of awareness about NIHL due <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> excessive <b>noise</b> during matches among the spectators surveyed...|$|R
50|$|Chronic <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> {{may cause}} noise-induced hearing loss. Older males exposed to {{significant}} occupational noise demonstrate more significantly reduced hearing sensitivity than their non-exposed peers, though differences in hearing sensitivity decrease {{with time and}} the two groups are indistinguishable by age 79. A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} test itself, {{the ears of}} the client are usually {{examined}} with an otoscope {{to make sure they}} are free of wax, that the eardrum is intact, the ears are not infected, and the middle ear is free of fluid (indicating middle ear infection). The most common reasons to develop hearing loss due to genetic disorder, ageing problems, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> pollution, infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> {{can cause}} {{vibrations}} able to cause permanent {{damage to the}} ear. Both {{the volume of the}} noise and the duration of exposure can influence the likelihood of damage. Sound is measured in units called decibels, which is a logarithmic scale of sound levels that corresponds to the level of loudness that an individual's ear would perceive. Because it is a logarithmic scale, even small incremental increases in decibels correlate to large increases in loudness, and an increase in the risk of hearing loss.|$|E
40|$|ABsTRACr In {{this study}} {{the effects on}} hearing induced by {{occupational}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> impulse <b>noise</b> were compared with those induced by <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> continuous steady state noise. Three groups exposed <b>to</b> impulse <b>noise,</b> one group exposed to continuous steady state noise, and an unexposed control group were studied. The hearing thresholds of the groups were measured by a puretone audiometer three times in two workdays. None of the groups showed {{significant differences between the}} hearing thresholds measured in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. Group 1 with the shortest duration of exposure and group 2 with the intermediate duration of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> impulse <b>noise</b> had the highest thresholds at 6000 Hz in both ears. Group 3 with the longest duration of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> impulse <b>noise</b> had the highest thresholds asymmetrically, at 4000 Hz in the left ear and at 6000 Hz in the right ear. The group exposed to continuous steady state noise also had the highest thresholds asymmetrically, in the left ear at 6000 Hz. It was concluded that the longer the duration of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> impulse <b>noise</b> the wider the region of the frequencies that showed raised threshold shifts in both ears. Impulse <b>noise</b> seemed <b>to</b> produce permanent threshold shifts at 4000 and 6000 Hz after a shorter duration of exposure than continuous steady state noise...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{noise is}} a global {{occupational}} health hazard with considerable social and physiological impacts, including noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Numerous researches and studies conducted, worldwide, indicate that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> high <b>noise</b> levels at mining workers poses a serious risks factor for hearing loss. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> high <b>noise</b> levels can cause difficult verbal communication and reducing ability to recognize warning signals, as well as causing workwrs` stress and fatigue.

50|$|Globally mining {{operations}} {{are at risk}} of fatigued workers. Sleepiness and fatigue increase human error and contribute to accidents which can be fatal. Factors compounding fatigue levels in mine workers include; disruptions in circadian rhythms due to shift work, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise,</b> vibration and chemicals, monotonous and repetitive nature of tasks and night shift driving. Studies recognise a connotation between lifestyle and fatigue. Mine workers in developing countries depend on unreliable public transport systems which add additional commuting hours to their workday. These workers are more susceptible to poor quality and quantity of sleep.|$|E
50|$|Half {{of hearing}} loss is preventable. This {{includes}} by immunization, proper care around pregnancy, avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications. The World Health Organization recommends {{that young people}} limit the use of personal audio players to {{an hour a day}} in an effort to limit <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise.</b> Early identification and support are particularly important in children. For many hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implants and subtitles are useful. Lip reading is another useful skill some develop.

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with audiometric testing, OAE testing {{can be completed}} to determine changes in the responses. Studies have found that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> can cause a decline in OAE responses. In a study, industrial workers who were exposed 84.5 dBA of noise were compared to workers {{who were exposed to}} 53.2 dBA of noise by considering hearing thresholds and OAEs before and after 5 days of work. This study revealed that hearing thresholds and OAE results were significantly lower among the workers who were exposed to higher levels of noise.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Despite ample medical {{evidence}} of the adverse impacts of traffic noise on health, most policies for traffic noise management are arbitrary or incomplete, resulting in serious social and economic impacts. Surprisingly, there is limited information about citizen&rsquo;s <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> worldwide. This paper presents the 2 Loud? mobile phone application, developed and tested as a methodology to monitor, assess and map the level of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> of citizens with focus on the night period and indoor locations, since sleep disturbance {{is one of the}} major triggers for ill health related <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise.</b> Based on a community participation experiment using the 2 Loud? mobile phone application in a region close to freeways in Australia, the results of this research indicates a good level of accuracy for the noise monitoring by mobile phones and also demonstrates significant levels of indoor night <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> in the study area. The proposed methodology, through the data produced and the participatory process involved, can potentially assist in planning and management towards healthier urban environments...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} a relation between residential <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise</b> and hypertension.  METHODS—The study population comprised two random samples of subjects aged 19 - 80 years, one including 266  residents in the vicinity of Stockholm Arlanda airport, and another comprising 2693  inhabitants in other parts of Stockholm county. The subjects were classified according to the time weighted equal energy and maximum aircraft noise levels at their residence. A questionnaire provided information on individual characteristics including history of hypertension.  RESULTS—The prevalence odds ratio for hypertension adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and education was 1. 6  (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 0  to 2. 5) among those with energy averaged aircraft noise levels exceeding 55  dBA, and 1. 8  (95 % CI 1. 1  to 2. 8) among those with maximum aircraft noise levels exceeding 72  dBA. An exposure-response relation was suggested for both exposure measures. The <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise</b> seemed particularly important for older subjects and for those not reporting impaired hearing ability.  CONCLUSIONS—Community <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> aircraft <b>noise</b> may be associated with hypertension...|$|R
50|$|An Exposure Action Value (EAV) or Action Value (AV) is a {{limit set}} on {{occupational}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels. These levels are measured in decibels. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set the EAV to 85 dB(A). When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85 dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective hearing conservation program. The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.|$|E
50|$|Noise {{pollution}} control in residences is not {{funded by the}} federal government {{in part because of the}} disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the effect of noise is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body. For instance, hearing loss could be attributed to a variety of factors including age, rather than solely due to excessive <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise.</b> A state or local government is able to regulate indoor residential noise, however, such as when excessive noise from within a home causes disturbances to nearby residences.|$|E
50|$|About 22 {{million workers}} {{are exposed to}} {{hazardous}} noise, with additional millions exposed to solvents and metals that could put them {{at increased risk for}} hearing loss. Occupational hearing loss {{is one of the most}} common occupational diseases. 49% of male miners have hearing loss by the age of 50. By the age of 60, this number goes up to 70%. Construction workers also suffer an elevated risk. A screening program focused on construction workers employed at US Department of Energy facilities found 58% with significant abnormal hearing loss due to noise exposures at work. Occupational hearing loss is present in up to 33% of workers overall. Occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> causes 16% of adult disabling hearing loss worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Deafness {{can also}} result from {{environmental}} factors {{or a combination}} of genetic and environmental factors, including certain medications, peri-natal infections (infections occurring before or after birth), and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> loud <b>noise</b> over an extended period.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{prevention}} strategies available to avoid or reduce hearing loss. If not prevented, hearing loss can be managed through assistive devices and cognitive therapies. Prevention is the best defense against noise-induced hearing loss. The best, first option for protecting hearing is lowering the volume of sound at its source. Secondly, limiting the time of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> loud <b>noise</b> can reduce injury. Finally, physical protection from the noise can reduce its impact. Government regulations are designed <b>to</b> limit occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> dangerously loud <b>noise.</b>|$|R
