5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
25|$|A final {{advantage}} of this approach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for natural direct descriptions {{of many of the}} fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} this deal <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> Advance/Newhouse to more {{directly}} control their cable investments without having to completely unravel the TWEAN partnership, which does bring some benefits via Time Warner's development and purchasing clout.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the Act <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> injured sailors to obtain compensation from their employers for the negligence of the owner, the captain, or fellow members of the crew.|$|R
50|$|One {{criticism}} of Bedlam {{at this time}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> paying visitors to observe the lunatics and despite the banning of this practice at St. Luke's, Monro didn't restrict it until 1770.|$|R
50|$|This romanization {{will be used}} in {{this article}} to present grammar examples. The {{advantages}} of this scheme <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> capitalization (e.g. of proper nouns), and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> more familiar to the general linguist (especially one familiar with African studies).|$|R
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Jeffries case is that while a university cannot fire a professor for opinions and speech, they have more flexibility with a position like department chair. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> public institutions to discipline employees in general for disruptive speech.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of having two <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> preparation for an emergency. While {{one of the}} submersibles is conducting its dive, the other remains at readiness should there be an emergency, needing to be boarded on ship and hurried {{to the site of}} the problem. Such an emergency could include the submersible becoming tangled in fishing nets or entrapped in rocks or debris on the ocean floor. In such cases, the second heads to the rescue. There are also research experiments where it is advantageous to use the two vessels together.|$|E
25|$|The Animas Ping is a pump/blood glucose meter combo {{that connect}} {{to each other}} using radio frequency. They both can work {{independently}} {{of each other and}} each have their own history storage. The main purpose of the connection between the pump and the meter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> boluses to be made from the meter or the pump. This is particularly useful when correcting for a high blood sugar as the meter remembers readings and automatically enters them in correction boluses if they are less than 15 minutes old.|$|E
2500|$|Maverick's stated {{reason for}} not {{branding}} his cattle <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he didn't want to inflict pain on them. [...] Other ranchers, however, suspected his true motivation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to collect any unbranded cattle and claim them as his own.|$|R
5000|$|Part of {{the appeal}} of aerosol writing for Phase 2 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to get his [...] "name" [...] known yet remain anonymous. He noted later that tagging {{provided}} disadvantaged urban teens [...] "the only significant vehicle to represent their 'existence.'" ...|$|R
50|$|One {{theory for}} why {{primates}} developed sensitivity to red <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> ripe fruit to {{be distinguished from}} unripe fruit and inedible vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} of the Montmartre line differs from conventional funicular railways {{in that it is}} derived from that of standard up-down elevators, with each car being equipped with its own counterweight, rather than relying on the other car for counterbalance. The benefit of this design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> each car to function independently, with its own hoist and cables. This allows one car to remain in service if the other must be taken out of service for maintenance. At busy times, both cabins can ascend at the same time (usually, more passengers use the funicular to ascend than to descend).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} and more distinctive features of Serious Editor 2's level editor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for real-time editing. The level design process for most games often requires the level to be modified in the editor, compiled, saved, and then loaded separately in the game where it can be tested. However, Serious Editor 2 allows for levels to be played and tested within the editor without requiring compilation. While playing the level within the editor, the level designer can directly switch to editing mode, make the desired modifications, and then continue playing, greatly simplifying the final stages of level editing.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 9000 BC both grain and cattle {{were used as}} money or as barter (Davies) (the first grain remains found, {{considered}} to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC). Some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as camels and goats, {{may have been used}} as currency {{in some parts of the}} world. One of the advantages of using cattle as currency <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the seller to set a fixed price. It even created the standard pricing. For example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.|$|E
50|$|The main {{allegation}} {{against the}} Man Gyong Bong 92 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> the smuggling of illegal items {{to and from}} Japan. Specifically, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> believed <b>that</b> drugs and weapons were being smuggled into Japan, and cash, missile parts, and other potentially dangerous technology were secretly being taken to North Korea.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of synthetic division <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> one to calculate without writing variables, it uses few calculations, {{and it takes}} significantly less space on paper than long division. Also, the subtractions in long division are converted to additions by switching the signs at the very beginning, preventing sign errors.|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with Captain E von Wohlgemuth of the Imperial German Navy, Marcus invented an electrical ignition of ships cannons. The {{advantages of the}} system <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> for the simultaneous firing of the cannons, or selection of a particular firing pattern, {{and the ability to}} fire them from the ship's bridge.|$|R
25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> Davidson {{to draw on the}} work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.|$|E
25|$|Though the Animorphs {{can assume}} {{the form of}} any animal they touch, there are several {{limitations}} to the ability. The most vital {{is that they can}} stay in animal form for a maximum of two hours, otherwise they will be unable to return to human form. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming the human intellect. A benefit to morphing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately the railroad's {{primary line}} was {{extended}} south from the Twin Cities into Iowa and then east to Peoria. It ran through Mason City, Iowa, which {{became an important}} traffic center for the railroad. One of the major attractions of the railroad <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> freight bound for Illinois to bypass Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|Wonder Warthog Racing (WWR) was {{a unique}} {{organization}} created in 2004 by computer engineer, Scott Kandel, and former professional motocross racer, Steve Bauer, to better the sport of motocross. The significance of WWR <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> under-resourced racers (the [...] "privateers") to thrive with non-traditional forms of support for their careers.|$|R
25|$|Alan Scott wields {{a magical}} ring {{that can produce}} a variety of effects. The extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined, but three {{consistent}} traits <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> him to fly, <b>that</b> its effects <b>are</b> accompanied by a green light, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot directly affect anything made of wood.|$|R
25|$|Muhammad was monogamously {{married to}} Khadija, his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married {{multiple}} women, mostly widows, {{for social and}} political reasons. He had a total of nine wives, but not {{all at the same}} time, depending on the sources in his lifetime. The Qur'an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife. One reason cited for polygyny <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, the wife can set a condition, in the marriage contract, that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage. In such a case, the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife. According to traditional Islamic law, each of those wives keeps their property and assets separate; and are paid mahar and maintenance separately by their husband. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} of feminist epistemology <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> {{social and political}} values to influence its findings. Susan Haack {{also points out that}} feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within [...] "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".|$|E
500|$|Players control {{individual}} ships, {{with which}} they can earn money by defeating enemies and then buy new ship parts. ProtoGalaxy may be played on single-player or multiplayer mode, where players can team up either online or on a single system. Allgame, a video game review website, labelled ProtoGalaxy as an [...] "overhead free-roaming shooter". One {{of the features of}} the game <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> players to create their own levels, put them online, and download new levels other players have created.|$|E
50|$|Particular {{advantages}} {{of this process}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> high-viscosity pastes to <b>be</b> milled, and <b>that</b> the high surface contact with the cooled rollers allow the temperature to remain low despite the high amount of dispersion work being put in. A notable disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the large open area of paste on the rollers causes loss of volatiles.|$|R
5000|$|A newer {{approach}} is to perform video and multimedia optimization in [...] "the cloud" [...] - data centers either operated by the service provider or by a third party. The major benefits of this technique <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> smoother bit rate adaptation and utilizes transcoding and caching methods to distribute resources only when {{and where they are}} needed.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of the shutter glass system <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> the same display {{to be used for}} multiple unrelated images, one of which was visible without any glasses at all. Unfortunately, the contrast ratio of the public image is only 1/2 the available contrast ratio of the CRT when driven with only a public image.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the Madrid system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process. Furthermore, the [...] "coverage" [...] of the international registration may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the gas operation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. [...] Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete {{in an area that}} had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas-operated mechanism are the large size of the Desert Eagle, {{and the fact that it}} discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing could clog the gas release tap, preventing proper function.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of N scale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track {{runs into the}} same amount of space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they are in HO scale (1:87). While N scale is quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as [...] Z scale is smaller yet at 1:220 and T scale is 1:450 or 1:480. N scale is considered generally compatible with [...] for miniature wargaming.|$|E
50|$|What set the RISpec {{apart from}} other {{standards}} of the time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> using high-level geometric primitives, like quadrics or bicubic patches, to specify geometric primitives implicitly, {{rather than relying on}} a modeling application to generate polygons approximating these shapes explicitly beforehand. Another novelty introduced by the RISpec at the time was the specification of a shading language.|$|R
5000|$|Aztec men {{and women}} practiced labret piercing. The initial piercing, like ear and lip piercings, {{did not include the}} {{ornament}} being placed in the freshly pierced skin. Part of this was the ritual movement of becoming an adult in which ornamentation signified adulthood. Another reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> for more bloodletting practices and appeasement of deities throughout this time.|$|R
5000|$|Slot car set: In 1993, Marchon, Inc. {{released}} a slot car set called [...] "Rescue 911 Chopper Rescue". The set included two slot cars (a fire truck {{and a police}} jeep) and a complete racetrack. A unique feature of this track <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> racers to jump their cars over a canyon {{with the aid of}} a magnetic helicopter.|$|R
