[...] "The law of war has never been, and should not be, part of the domestic laws in the United States," [...] she wrote. [...] "The law of war is vague by necessity [...] it needs flexibility. It is therefore ill-suited to domestic application {{and it would be}} ill-advised to make it a part of domestic law." [...] Forrest also argued that in passing the law, Congress had dramatically expanded the categories of people that can be detained. The U.S. government had argued that the NDAA was a reassertion of powers provided by Congress in the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which targeted perpetrators of the September 11 attacks and those who helped them. Judge Forrest said the new measure was broader, because it covered people beyond those connected to the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest {{granted the}} plaintiffs' motion for a {{permanent}} injunction of § 1021(b)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in a 112-page opinion. The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense authorization law to hold people in indefinite military <b>detention</b> <b>on</b> <b>suspicion</b> that they [...] "substantially supported" [...] Al Qaeda or its allies — at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of [...] "substantially supported" [...] and [...] "associated forces" [...] were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist {{could not be sure}} they would not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed to be associated with terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties.|$|E
60|$|The fête, then, is over; the pompous black pyramid at the Louvre {{is only a}} {{skeleton}} now; all the flags have been miraculously whisked away during the night, and the fine chandeliers which glittered down the Champs Elysées for full half a mile, have been consigned to their dens and darkness. Will they ever be reproduced for other celebrations of the glorious 29th of July?--I think not; the Government which vowed {{that there should be}} no more persecutions of the press, was, on that very 29th, seizing a Legitimist paper, for some real or fancied offence against it: it had seized, and was seizing daily, numbers of persons merely suspected of being disaffected (and you may fancy how liberty is understood, when some of these prisoners, the other day, on coming to trial, were found guilty and sentenced to ONE day's imprisonment, after THIRTY-SIX DAYS' <b>DETENTION</b> <b>ON</b> <b>SUSPICION).</b> I think the Government which follows such a system, cannot be very anxious about any farther revolutionary fêtes, and that the Chamber may reasonably refuse to vote more money for them. Why should men be so mighty proud of having, on a certain day, cut a certain number of their fellow-countrymen's throats? The Guards and the Line employed this time nine years did no more than those who cannonaded the starving Lyonnese, or bayoneted the luckless inhabitants of the Rue Transnounain:--they did but fulfil the soldier's honorable duty:--his superiors bid him kill and he killeth:--perhaps, had he gone to his work with a little more heart, the result would have been different, and then--would the conquering party have been justified in annually rejoicing over the conquered? Would we have thought Charles X. justified in causing fireworks to be blazed, and concerts to be sung, and speeches to be spouted, in commemoration of his victory over his slaughtered countrymen?--I wish for my part they would allow the people to go about their business as on the other 362 days of the year, and leave the Champs Elysées free for the omnibuses to run, and the Tuileries' in quiet, so that the nurse-maids might come as usual, and the newspapers be read for a halfpenny apiece.|$|E

40|$|Collective Action to Support the Reintegration of Return Migrants {{in their}} Country of Origin (MIREM) Britain {{is not an}} obvious country to which Algerians migrate, {{although}} {{the crisis of the}} Algerian civil war in the 1990 s was to make it an alternative to continental Europe, especially France. From 45 in 1991, asylum applications peaked in 1995 at 1, 865 persons and then ran at a consistently high level up to 2002. They are now in steep decline. Return of Algerian asylum-seekers has not followed a similar pattern, however, and many Algerians in Britain are illegally here. In fact, they have ranged between 85 (1998) and 220 (2005) a year, with no figures being available for 1999 and 2000. The British government admits that the efficacy of its return policy has been very limited, although domestic pressure has led to a much more concerted effort to return failed asylum seekers in recent years. However, the bare statistics must be seen against the growth of British security policies since 2001 and particularly since 2005. Fears of terrorism in Britain linked to the Algerian community here have led to a disproportionate arrest rate amongst Algerians, particularly in the ricin trial, the indefinite <b>detention</b> of Algerians <b>on</b> <b>suspicion</b> of involvement in terrorism without trial, agreements about mutual extradition, memoranda of understanding over the return of Algerians allegedly involved in terrorist activities and much closer cooperation between British and Algerian security services. This securitisation process has made the return of Algerians to Algeria much more problematic and has brought into question the British government’s commitment to its obligations within the European Union.

Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28. According to the German media, the main suspect and two of the other suspects had previously stayed in Germany and committed crimes under several different identities.|$|R
