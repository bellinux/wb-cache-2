5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, <b>including</b> <b>me...</b> Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, <b>including</b> <b>me</b> when I was President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, {{and we all have}} to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly. As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week.|$|E

500|$|McCain also harshly criticized Obama for {{scrapping}} {{construction of}} the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar {{to what he had}} proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, [...] "A lot of people, <b>including</b> <b>me,</b> thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration.

500|$|Lin's {{experience}} in the NBA draft {{was used as an}} example in the nonfiction psychology book The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis, which details how stereotypes can overwhelmingly influence a person's decision making, {{even in the face of}} contradictory evidence. In the book, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey stated that Lin did very well in pre-draft testing. [...] "He lit up our [...] model," [...] said Morey. [...] "Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft." [...] A year after the Rockets failed to draft Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps; Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured, and he was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. [...] "He's incredibly athletic," [...] said Morey. [...] "But the reality is that every fucking person, <b>including</b> <b>me,</b> thought he was unathletic.

2500|$|In 1934, Kirchner visited Berne and Zurich, {{finding the}} former more {{pleasing}} than the latter, and met Paul Klee. In {{the winter of}} 1935, a new school was being planned {{to be built in}} Frauenkirch and Kirchner offered to paint a mural. This project was dropped and instead Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse. Reflecting on the inauguration of the schoolhouse in 1936 he writes, [...] "the new school was inaugurated yesterday. It was a celebration with songs, dancing and speeches, followed by drinking such as I have not seen or experienced in decades...They made a point of <b>including</b> <b>me</b> and so there I was, sitting once again amongst these people who had received me with such kindness and friendliness on the alp twenty years ago.

[...] Gingrich added, [...] "Bill Buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy, intelligence, wit, and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement... Buckley began what led to Senator Barry Goldwater and his Conscience of a Conservative that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the Republican Party. From that emerged Ronald Reagan."

2500|$|Young-adult {{readers and}} authors, {{including}} Green himself, {{have been critical}} of the terms. Green has voiced his disagreement with the idea that he is single-handedly responsible for launching or promoting any one individual's career. Green has commented on these arguments: [...] "My concern is that popular work by women receives far more vitriolic criticism from the public (like, in terms of number of demeaning jokes...) than popular work created by men... Also, I would like to see equal attention given to the sexism in popular work by men, from Nicholas Sparks to for instance J. D. Salinger. Catcher in the Rye—although I like it very much—is profoundly and disturbingly misogynistic and yet seems to get a critical pass both online and off. This happens a lot, I think, with books by men, and I don't want male writers (<b>including</b> <b>me!)</b> to get that pass." [...] Relating to this issue, Green has stated that he identifies as a feminist.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, <b>including</b> <b>me</b> ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E

60|$|I was in New York when I {{received}} {{the order to}} proceed immediately to Chicago. The man who gave me the order {{was one of the}} oligarchs, I could tell that by his speech, though I did not know his name nor see his face. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had been countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and countless agents of the Iron Heel, <b>including</b> <b>me,</b> either on the ground or being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart was beating madly. I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were given.|$|E
60|$|Miss ---- {{wrote to}} me in Paris to propose {{travelling}} with us, which Robert lacked chivalry to accede to; and, in fact, our ways of journeying are too uncertain to admit of arrangements with anyone beyond our circle. For instance, we took nine days to get here from Paris, spending only one day at Chambéry, {{for the sake of}} Les Charmettes and Rousseau. Robert played the 'Dream' on the old harpsichord, the keys of which rattled in a ghastly way, {{as if it were the}} bones of him who once so 'dreamed.' Then there was the old watch hung up, without a tick in it. At St. Jean de Maurienne we got into difficulties with diligences, and submitted to being thrown out for the night at Lanslebourg, I more dead than alive, and indeed I suffered much in passing the mountain next morning. Then again, on the sea, we had a burrasca, and the captain had half a mind when half-way to Leghorn to turn back to Genoa. Passengers much frightened, <b>including</b> <b>me,</b> a little. A wretched Neapolitan boat, with a machine 'inclined to go to the devil every time the wind went anywhere,' as I heard a French gentleman on board say afterwards. Altogether we were so done up after eighteen hours of it, that we stayed at Leghorn instead of going on straight to Florence. Still, now I seem to have got over fatigue and the rest--and we keep our faces turned undeviatingly to Rome. Mdme. du Quaire having carefully apprised M. Mignaty that we left Paris on the thirteenth, our friends here seem to have made up their minds that we had perished by land or water, and Annunziata's poor sister had passed three days in tears, for instance.|$|E
6000|$|I DIDN'T {{make you}} know how glad I was [...] To have you come and camp here on our land. [...] I promised myself to get down some day [...] And see the way you lived, but I don't know! [...] With a houseful of hungry men to feed [...] I guess you'd find.... It seems to me [...] I can't express my {{feelings}} any more [...] Than I can raise my voice or want to lift [...] My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to). [...] Did ever you feel so? I hope you never. [...] It's got so I don't even know for sure [...] Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything. [...] There's nothing but a voice-like left inside [...] That seems {{to tell me how}} I ought to feel, [...] And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong. [...] You take the lake. I look and look at it. [...] I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water. [...] I stand and make myself repeat out loud [...] The advantages it has, so long and narrow, [...] Like a deep piece of some old running river [...] Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles [...] Straight away through the mountain notch [...] From the sink window where I wash the plates, [...] And all our storms come up toward the house, [...] Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter. [...] It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit [...] To step outdoors and take the water dazzle [...] A sunny morning, or take the rising wind [...] About my face and body and through my wrapper, [...] When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den, [...] And a cold chill shivered across the lake. [...] I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water, [...] Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it? [...] I expect, though, everyone's heard of it. [...] In a book about ferns? Listen to that! [...] You let things more like feathers regulate [...] Your going and coming. And you like it here? [...] I can see how you might. But I don't know! [...] It would be different if more people came, [...] For then there would be business. As it is, [...] The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them, [...] Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore [...] That ought to be worth something, and may yet. [...] But I don't count on it as much as Len. [...] He looks on the bright side of everything, [...] <b>Including</b> <b>me.</b> He thinks I'll be all right [...] With doctoring. But it's not medicine-- [...] Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so-- [...] It's rest I want--there, I have said it out-- [...] From cooking meals for hungry hired men [...] And washing dishes after them--from doing [...] Things over and over that just won't stay done. [...] By good rights I ought not to have so much [...] Put on me, but there seems no other way. [...] Len says one steady pull more ought to do it. [...] He says the best way out is always through. [...] And I agree to that, or in so far [...] As that I can see no way out but through-- [...] Leastways for me--and then they'll be convinced. [...] It's not that Len don't want the best for me. [...] It was his plan our moving over in [...] Beside the lake from where that day I showed you [...] We used to live--ten miles from anywhere. [...] We didn't change without some sacrifice, [...] But Len went at it to make up the loss. [...] His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun, [...] But he works when he works as hard as I do-- [...] Though there's small profit in comparisons. [...] (Women and men will make them all the same.) [...] But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much. [...] He's into everything in town. This year [...] It's highways, and he's got too many men [...] Around him to look after that make waste. [...] They take advantage of him shamefully, [...] And proud, too, of themselves for doing so. [...] We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings, [...] Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk [...] While I fry their bacon. Much they care! [...] No more put out in what they do or say [...] Than if I wasn't in the room at all. [...] Coming and going all the time, they are: [...] I don't learn what their names are, let alone [...] Their characters, or whether they are safe [...] To have inside the house with doors unlocked. [...] I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not [...] Afraid of me. There's two can play at that. [...] I have my fancies: it runs in the family. [...] My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him [...] Locked up for years back there at the old farm. [...] I've been away once--yes, I've been away. [...] The State Asylum. I was prejudiced; [...] I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there; [...] You know the old idea--the only asylum [...] Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford, [...] Rather than send their folks to such a place, [...] Kept them at home; and it does seem more human. [...] But it's not so: the place is the asylum. [...] There they have every means proper to do with, [...] And you aren't darkening other people's lives-- [...] Worse than no good to them, and they no good [...] To you in your condition; you can't know [...] Affection or the want of it in that state. [...] I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way. [...] My father's brother, he went mad quite young. [...] Some thought he had been bitten by a dog, [...] Because his violence took on the form [...] Of carrying his pillow in his teeth; [...] But it's more likely he was crossed in love, [...] Or so the story goes. It was some girl. [...] Anyway all he talked about was love. [...] They soon saw he would do someone a mischief [...] If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended [...] In father's building him a sort of cage, [...] Or room within a room, of hickory poles, [...] Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,-- [...] A narrow passage all the way around. [...] Anything they put in for furniture [...] He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on. [...] So they made the place comfortable with straw, [...] Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences. [...] Of course they had to feed him without dishes. [...] They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded [...] With his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes. [...] Cruel--it sounds. I 'spose they did the best [...] They knew. And just when he was at the height, [...] Father and mother married, and mother came, [...] A bride, to help take care of such a creature, [...] And accommodate her young life to his. [...] That was what marrying father meant to her. [...] She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful [...] By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout [...] Until the strength was shouted out of him, [...] And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion. [...] He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string, [...] And let them go and make them twang until [...] His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow. [...] And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play-- [...] The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though, [...] They found a way {{to put a stop to}} it. [...] He was before my time--I never saw him; [...] But the pen stayed exactly as it was [...] There in the upper chamber in the ell, [...] A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter. [...] I often think of the smooth hickory bars. [...] It got so I would say--you know, half fooling-- [...] "It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail"-- [...] Just as you will till it becomes a habit. [...] No wonder I was glad to get away. [...] Mind you, I waited till Len said the word. [...] I didn't want the blame if things went wrong. [...] I was glad though, no end, when we moved out, [...] And I looked to be happy, and I was, [...] As I said, for a while--but I don't know! [...] Somehow the change wore out like a prescription. [...] And there's more to it than just window-views [...] And living by a lake. I'm past such help-- [...] Unless Len took the notion, which he won't, [...] And I won't ask him--it's not sure enough. [...] I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going: [...] Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I? [...] I almost think if I could do like you, [...] Drop everything and live out on the ground-- [...] But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it, [...] Or a long rain. I should soon get enough, [...] And be glad of a good roof overhead. [...] I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant, [...] More than you have yourself, some of these nights. [...] The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away [...] From over you as you lay in your beds. [...] I haven't courage for a risk like that. [...] Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work, [...] But the thing of it is, I need to be kept. [...] There's work enough to do--there's always that; [...] But behind's behind. The worst that you can do [...] Is set me back a little more behind. [...] I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway. [...] I'd rather you'd not go unless you must.|$|E
