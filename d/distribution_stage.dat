40|$|The {{merging of}} some water {{utilities}} in Japan has become possible since the 2000 Outline of Administrative Reform and the 2001 Water Act Revision. There are two avenues to merge water utilities, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration. Horizontal consolidation enables water distributors, {{such as the}} large water supply systems, to merge into one. Vertical integration enables water distributors and water wholesalers, such as the bulk water supply systems, to merge into one. However, these wide area consolidations or integrations haven 8 ̆ 1 ft been promoted at local government level due to an absence of authority.

Assuming an appropriate data aggregation, the simultaneous supply chain planning dominates successive approaches. However, as the simultaneous planning of all supply chain tasks is considered to be impracticable, short-term continuous-time models for production, distribution and scheduling (for example Steinrücke 2011, 2015) should be applied additionally after solving our proposed discrete-time model.|$|R

By allowing eligible end-users to choose their supplier, the acts necessarily allow competition in distribution-supply. Both acts, however, do not explicitly distinguish electricity-distribution into a distributionnetwork stage and a distribution-supply stage. The consequence is that they lack two important regulatory measures for the <b>distribution</b> <b>stage.</b> Separate accounts for distribution-networks versus distribution-supply are not prescribed and cross-subsidies between these two activities are not explicitly prohibited. This contrasts to the regulatory approach towards the transmission network. This is inconsistent and may hinder competition in supply. JEL classification: L 51, L 43, L 94 1...|$|E

For its solution, we propose an iterative linear programming approach that utilizes shadow price information from a series of successive transportation problems. To evaluate the heuristic’s effectiveness, we compare it with a “brute-force ” enumeration using a grid-search.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Older {{women with}} breast cancer have poorer {{relative}} survival outcomes, but whether achieving earlier stage at diagnosis would translate to substantial reductions in mortality is uncertain. METHODS: We analysed data on East of England women {{with breast cancer}} (2006 - 2010) aged 70 + years. We estimated survival for different stage-deprivation-age group strata using both the observed and a hypothetical <b>stage</b> <b>distribution</b> (assuming that all women aged 75 + years acquired the <b>stage</b> <b>distribution</b> of those aged 70 - 74 years). We subsequently estimated deaths that could be postponed beyond 5 years from diagnosis if women aged 75 + years had the hypothetical <b>stage</b> <b>distribution.</b> We projected findings to the English population using appropriate age and socioeconomic group weights. RESULTS: For a typically sized annual cohort in the East of England, 27 deaths in women with breast cancer aged 75 + years can be postponed within 5 years from diagnosis if their <b>stage</b> <b>distribution</b> matched that of the women aged 70 - 74 years (4. 8 % of all 566 deaths within 5 years post diagnosis in this population).

40|$|Background. Large {{international}} {{differences in}} colorectal cancer survival exist, even between countries with similar healthcare. We investigate {{the extent to}} which stage at diagnosis explains these differences. Methods. Data from population-based cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK were analysed for 313 852 patients diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer during 2000 - 2007. We compared the <b>distributions</b> of <b>stage</b> at diagnosis. We estimated both stage-specific net survival and the excess hazard of death up to three years after diagnosis, using flexible parametric models on the log-cumulative excess hazard scale. Results. International differences in colon and rectal cancer <b>stage</b> <b>distributions</b> were wide: Denmark showed a distribution skewed towards later-stage disease, while Australia, Norway and the UK showed high proportions of 'regional' disease. One-year colon cancer survival was 67 % in the UK and ranged between 71 % (Denmark) and 80 % (Australia and Sweden) elsewhere. For rectal cancer, one-year survival was also low in the UK (75 %), compared to 79 % in Denmark and 82 - 84 % elsewhere. International survival differences were also evident for each stage of disease, with the UK showing consistently lowest survival at one and three years. Conclusion. Differences in stage at diagnosis partly explain international differences in colorectal cancer survival, with a more adverse <b>stage</b> <b>distribution</b> contributing to comparatively low survival in Denmark. Differences in <b>stage</b> <b>distribution</b> could arise because of differences in diagnostic delay and awareness of symptoms, or in the thoroughness of staging procedures. Nevertheless, survival differences also exist for each stage of disease, suggesting unequal access to optimal treatment, particularly in the UK...|$|R
