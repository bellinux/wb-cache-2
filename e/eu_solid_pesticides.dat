The pebbles are fabricated using a melt-spray method and hence a size variation in the pebbles produced is expected. The knowledge of the mechanical integrity (crush strength) of the pebbles is important for a successful design of breeder blanket. In this paper, we present the ex-perimental results of the crush (failure) loads for spherical OSi pebbles of different diameters rang-ing from 250 µm to 800 µm. The ultimate failure load for each size shows a Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the mean crush load increases with increase in pebble diameter. It is also observed that the level of opacity of the pebble influences the crush load significantly. The experimental data presented in this paper and the associated analysis could possibly help us to develop a framework for simulating a crushable polydisperse pebble assem-bly using discrete element method.

40|$|Objectives This {{study was}} carried out in {{response}} to health authorities' concerns regarding what they considered to be a "high proportion" of birth defects (BD) in a rural Venezuelan state as the preliminary step towards subsequent health assessment regarding exposure to pesticides and possible association with registered BD. Methods This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Generalised linear modelling (GLM) was used for relating BD with county of origin and the date of the events. Pesticide-use reports were used for assessing exposure to pesticides. Infants' medical records for 1999 - 2002 were obtained from the state hospital. The study group consisted of 108 BD cases from 8 municipalities. Results The cardiovascular system had the highest frequency (20, 4 %) of BD, followed by the gastro-intestinal (18, 5 %) and urogenital systems (10, 2 %). Anilides were the most frequently used group of liquid pesticides (39, 8 %), followed by phosphono-methyl-glycine (19, 6 %). The most commonly used <b>solid</b> <b>pesticides</b> were organophosphates (54, 4 %). GLM revealed some significant results; the number of BD increased exponentially throughout the years being studied. Conclusions A causal association between BD and potential pesticide exposure could not be demonstrated due to data limitations. A more in-depth exposure assessment and epidemiological studies are still needed for characterising the risk of exposure to pesticides in terms of birth outcomes in the area being studied...|$|R

Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2  min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387  μg L−  1. Samples {{from all of}} the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0. 1  μg L−  1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013 / 39 /EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25 %). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30 - or 4 -fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52 %), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended <b>solids</b> and <b>pesticides</b> were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude).

For a higher lutetium concentration x, the solid solutions contain an additional calcite phase with a content less than 5 wt %.

It has been shown that, as the lutetium concentration x in the Lu x Y 1 − x BO 3 : Ce 3 + solid solutions increases, the emission intensity smoothly decreases, which is associated with a gradual shift of the Ce 3 + 5 d(1) level toward the bottom of the conduction band, as well as with a decrease in the band gap.

40|$|We {{examined}} the mitigation efficiency of a managed riverine wetland amended {{with a mixture}} of suspended sediment, two nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and three pesticides (atrazine, metolachlor, and permethrin) during a simulated agricultural runoff event. Hydrologic management of the 500 m-long, 25 mwide riverine wetland was done by adding weirs at both ends. The agrichemical mixture was amended to the wetland at the upstream weir simulating a four-hour, ~ 1 cm rainfall event from a 16 ha agricultural field. Water samples (1 L) were collected every 30 min within the first 4 h, then every 4 h until 48 h, and again on days 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-amendment at distances of 0 m, 10 m, 40 m, 300 m and 500 m from the amendment point within the wetland for suspended <b>solids,</b> nutrient, and <b>pesticide</b> analyses. Peak sediment, nutrient, and pesticide concentrations occurred within 3 h of amendment at 0 m, 10 m, 40 m, and 300 m downstream and showed rapid attenuation of agrichemicals from the water column with 79 – 98 %, 42 – 98 %, and 63 – 98 % decrease in concentrations of sediments, nutrients, and pesticides, respectively, within 48 h. By day 28, all amendments were near or below pre-amendment concentrations. Water samples at 500 m showed no changes in sediment or nutrient concentrations; pesticide concentrations peaked within 48 h but at ≤ 11 % of upstream peak concentrations and had dissipated by day 28. Managed riverine wetlands≥ 1 ha and with hydraulic residence times of days to weeks can efficiently trap agricultural runoff during moderate (1 cm) late-spring and early-summer rainfall events, mitigating impacts to receiving rivers...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{has been}} {{responsible}} for an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces, leading to an increase in stormwater runoff and a decrease in groundwater recharge. Stormwater runoff contains pollutants, such as nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals, <b>solids,</b> organic compounds, <b>pesticides,</b> and chlorides, which have greatly contributed to the degradation of receiving waters due to surface discharge of stormwater. This has prompted stormwater managers to consider implementing more infiltration practices into their designs. However, past studies have shown that infiltrating stormwater could contaminate the groundwater, and in some cases, contamination actually has occurred. Therefore, methods for easily predicting contamination potential need to be developed. 	Stormwater pollutants interact with the soils in the unsaturated zone as they migrate towards the groundwater. The specific type of soil and its properties {{have a profound effect on}} the movement of water and pollutants. For this research, zinc and sodium chloride were chosen as the pollutants of interest because of their stormwater prevalence, solubility, and differing migration rates. Through the use of the SESOIL model, factors such as pollutant concentration, rainfall, vadose zone thickness, intrinsic permeability, organic content, and soil pH were evaluated to determine which ones likely have the greatest influence on pollutant migration. A factorial analysis (26 full factorial) was used to evaluate the effects of these factors on the maximum penetration depth of zinc and sodium chloride. High and low values for the factors were selected from the literature and the NRCS soils database. The pollutants were treated as separate ions (Zn+ 2, Na+, Cl-), and the length of each simulation was set at 1 year. Results indicated that rainfall was a common factor controlling Zn+ 2, Na+, and Cl- migration. Concentration was also influential in Zn+ 2 migration, while intrinsic permeability affected Na+ and Cl-...|$|R
