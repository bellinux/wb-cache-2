25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that they at least heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> stores, 8% heard it at work, 7% heard it at school, 7% heard it on grounds, 6% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> courts, and 8% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> other settings. In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation also learned that most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E

500|$|Lody's {{information}} was entirely inaccurate {{and had been}} gleaned, as he was to admit at his trial, purely from rumours: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the boarding-house and I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the barber's shop." [...] His second letter, in German, was addressed to [...] "Herr Stammer" [...] at German naval intelligence in Courbierestrasse, Berlin, and contained details of British naval losses and vessels stationed at Leith and Grangemouth. He had obtained details of the naval vessels simply by climbing Calton Hill in Edinburgh and observing the panorama from the summit, and by taking a promenade along the seafront at Grangemouth, used by thousands of citizens as a popular excursion. He {{was worried about the}} risks that he was taking and stated in his letter that he would not go near any place where he could be challenged, or where barricades and restrictions prevented access. His lack of training or preparation meant that these letters, like all of his communications, were written with no attempt at concealment whatsoever– no code or invisible ink– and were composed entirely en clair in ordinary written English or German.|$|E
500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a record shop in Smith Street. And I {{just thought it was}} incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time.

500|$|Goffman is {{sometimes}} credited with having in 1957 {{coined the term}} [...] "total institution", though Fine and Manning note that he had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> lectures by Everett Hughes in reference to any type of institution {{in which people are}} treated alike and in which behavior is regulated. Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term [...] "total institution", he popularized it with his 1961 book, Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates. The book has been described as [...] "ethnography of the concept of the total institution". [...] The book {{was one of the first}} sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness.|$|E
500|$|The {{ingredients}} {{are given in}} verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin, during William Sandys' 1846 tour around Cornwall. Sandys also includes a story of Christmas-time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with mashed potatoes and pilchards. In [...] "Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell's Mutton Pies", published in 1772, Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall. The Devon author, William Crossing, writing in 1911, discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie: [...] "Mutton, onions, apples and dough, Make a good pie as any I know." [...] He does not say, however, from where he <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the [...] song [...] "Glorious Devon" [...] written by Sir Edward German in 1905, several Devonshire dishes receive praise: [...] "Squab pie, junket and cider brew, Richest cream of the cow, What 'ud Old England without 'em do?" ...|$|E
500|$|Through his {{association}} with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, [...] "gave him a model for an orchestral sound". Bridge also led Britten {{to the music of}} Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: [...] "The real musicians are so few & far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs & Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?" [...] – adding, as an afterthought: [...] "Shostakovitch – perhaps – possibly". By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the [...] "brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger"; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements. Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair [...] "delicious" [...] when he <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found [...] "bewildering and terrifying", {{yet at the same time}} [...] "incredibly marvellous and arresting". The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms. [...] However, he and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust.|$|E

500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the studio and I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with}} the music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{producer}} Billy Sherrill and Jones himself, {{the singer}} hated the song {{when he first}} <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> Bob Allen's biography of the singer, Sherrill states, [...] "He thought it was too long, too sad, too depressing and that nobody would ever play it...He hated the melody and wouldn't learn it." [...] Sherrill also claims that Jones frustrated him by continually singing the song to the melody of the Kris Kristofferson hit [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night". In the Same Ole Me retrospective, Sherrill recalls a heated exchange during one recording session: [...] "I said 'That's not the melody!' and he said 'Yeah, but it's a better melody.' I said 'It might be—Kristofferson would think so too, it's his melody!'" [...] In the same documentary, Sherrill claims that Jones was in such bad physical shape during this period that [...] "the recitation was recorded 18 months after the first verse was" [...] and added that the last words Jones said about [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] was [...] "Nobody'll buy that morbid son of a bitch". Although he had disliked [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] {{when it was first}} offered to him, Jones ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating that [...] "a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song". Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980. The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Begin {{said that}} Shaw had been {{responsible}} for the failure to evacuate the hotel: [...] "A police officer called Shaw and told him, 'The Jews say that they have placed bombs in the King David.' And the reply was, 'I am here to give orders to the Jews, not to take orders from them.'" [...] The 1947 Irgun pamphlet Black Paper said that Shaw had forbidden anyone to leave the hotel: [...] "For reasons best known to himself Shaw, the Chief Secretary of the Occupation administration, disregarded the warning. That is, he forbade any of the other officials to leave the building, with the result that some of his collaborators were killed, while he himself slunk away until after the explosion. … Shaw thus sent nearly 100 people to their deaths—including Hebrews, including friends of our struggle." [...] Begin said that he had heard the information about Shaw from Israel Galili, Chief of Staff of Haganah, when they met on July 23, the day after the bombing. In an interview with Bethell, Galili said that his source for the Shaw story had been Boris Guriel, the future head of Israel's intelligence service, who had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> turn from the American Associated Press bureau chief Carter Davidson. Thurston Clarke interviewed both Galili and Guriel, the former in 1977. Guriel denied that he had been the source of the story. Galili was unable to produce any evidence that Shaw had received a warning. Carter Davidson died in 1958 and so could not be asked to confirm or deny what Galili had said. Clarke's assessment was that the story about Shaw was, in fact, [...] "a baseless rumour promoted by the Haganah in order to mollify the Irgun and fix responsibility for the carnage on Shaw." [...] Shmuel Katz, who {{had been a member of}} the Irgun's high command, later also wrote that [...] "the story can be dismissed." ...|$|E
