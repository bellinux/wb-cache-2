In this framework, the microzonation maps certainly represent the most adequate tool to account for this element in the seismic risk and for planning mitigation strategies. This study shows the preliminary results of a multidisciplinary research, which deals with the seismic microzonation of the Western area of Napoli. The selected case study is a challenging choice, as the seismic hazard is affected by both tectonic and volcanic seismicity, which in historical time differently affected the urban setting. The latter, in turn, results highly heterogeneous, as consisting of a mixing of both masonry and concrete structures. The adopted approach followed the recommendations of both the National and International Guidelines, {{with reference to the}} multi-levels methods. The collection, homogenization and synthesis of a significant number of existing data permitted the development of reliable <b>geological</b> and geotechnical <b>subsoil</b> models, leading to Grade I and II seismic microzonation maps, characterized by different expected amplification of ground motion and instability due to the liquefaction.

40|$|A good {{knowledge}} of shear wave (Vs) structural models {{is required for}} the realistic modelling of seismic hazard scenarios. Nowadays there are many approaches based on surface wave dispersion evaluation, mainly oriented to the use of controlled source techniques with appropriate shot gathers. Subsoil deep controlled source surveys suffer great logistic problems and costs, due to the amount of source energy they need (e. g. explosive). Otherwise realistic seismic motion evaluation requires the {{knowledge of}} Vs structural models even at large depths (e. g. 100 – 200 m). In this work we use the cross correlation of seismic noise in order to evaluate surface wave dispersion in a passive way, without controlled sources. Cross correlation of seismic noise recordings can be used to infer the impulse response between two points when the so-called noise correlation function (NCF) converges to the impulse response between two receivers, !ltered by the bandwidth of the noise spectrum. The NCF between two noise recording sensors could be in such a way considered as the passive analogous to a shot gather made with active sources in the space between the sensors themselves. In this work we computed the NCF between two sensors using both sea source noise and an anthropic noise source (an airport), in order to infer a Vs structural model pro!le in an area of the Venice Plain (North-East Italy). Rayleigh wave fundamental mode dispersion curve has been extracted from NCF using the Frequency Time Analysis (FTAN) method.

30|$|To obtain {{information}} on the influencing factors other than topographical properties (elevation, slope, valley shape, and watershed size) and rainfall data, field surveys should be thoroughly conducted throughout entire expressway facility sections. Because the assessment of debris-flow hazards {{in this study is}} to be applied on a regional scale for management of the entire national expressway system, the method needs to be simple and applicable to the macrozonation of debris-flow hazards. Other factors, such as {{the size and shape of}} a valley along with the variations in slope direction, properties of the <b>subsoil,</b> <b>geological</b> properties, and vegetation cover also have an influence on the movement of debris flows. To simplify the method, only slope information was considered for debris-flow movement possibilities. Because obtaining and processing all the attributes stated above in the prediction stage is a time-consuming and difficult task, we decided that only easily accessible document data (such as digital maps, geological maps, and so on) were to be used in the assessment process. For example, the spatial correlations (for site-specific microscale areas) between influence of debris flow and geological or vegetation characteristics were not well investigated in Korea. Since most debris flows regardless of scale are induced by regional torrential rains, available and reliable influencing attribute data such as rainfall and digital map is necessary to immediately evaluate the debris-flow hazard for a wide coverage area. Consequently, the KEC debris-flow hazard assessment method has become a fundamental assessment tool owing to its simplicity.|$|R

40|$|Volcanic areas often show complex {{behaviour}} {{as far as}} seismic waves propagation and {{seismic motion}} at surface are concerned. In fact, the finite lateral extent of surface layers such as lava flows, blocks, differential welding and/or zeolitization within pyroclastic deposits, introduces in the propagation of seismic waves effects such as the generation of surface waves at the edge, resonance in lateral direction, diffractions and scattering of energy, which tend to modify the amplitude {{as well as the}} duration of the ground motion. The irregular topographic surface, typical of volcanic areas, also strongly influences the seismic site response. Despite this heterogeneity, it is unfortunately a common geophysical and engineering practice to evaluate even in volcanic environments the subsurface velocity field with monodimensional investigation method (i. e. geognostic soundings, refraction survey, down-hole, etc.) prior to the seismic site response computation which in a such cases is obviously also made with 1 D algorithms. This approach often leads to highly inaccurate results. In this paper we use a different approach, i. e. a fully 2 D P-wave Çturning rayÈ tomographic survey followed by 2 D seismic site response modeling. We report here the results of this approach in three sites located at short distance from Mt. Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei and characterized by overburdens constituted by volcanoclastic deposits with large lateral and vertical variations of their elastic properties.

Raising the population awareness of the radon issue is therefore one of the aims of Czech radon programme. In the theoretical part of this bachelor thesis, the basic knowledge about radioactivity, ionizing radiation and its sources are summarized. The outline of quantities used in these matters was listed as well. This part by all means summarizes the radon issue, the occurrence of radon in buildings and its impacts on human health, as well as anti-radon measures. The practical part deals with the quantitative research, which task was to find out and evaluate the population awareness of the radon issue in the Pilsen Region. The research was carried out {{on the basis of}} questionnaire survey. To process the results, the methods of descriptive and mathematical statistics were used. With the help of two-choice t-test the stated hypothesis was confirmed: "The part of population of Pilsen Region which lives in family detached houses has statistically more relevant knowledge of radon issue that the part which lives in apartments. " The residents of family houses gave most of the time better answers to questions than residents of apartments. The best answered questions were those dealing with the problematics which citizen face when building a house. On the other hand, the worst answered questions were the professional ones, dealing with comparing radiation burden of radon to nuclear power plants or the concentration of radon in the Czech Republic. The benefit of this thesis is a retrieved overview of the awareness of the radon issue among the residents of Pilsen Region.

Leuven, Fysico-chemische Geologie, Celestijnenlaan 200 C, B- 3001 Heverlee BELGIUM (Valerie. Cappuyns@geo. kuleuven. ac. be) bK. U. Leuven, Fysico-chemische Geologie, Celestijnenlaan 200 C, B- 3001 Heverlee BELGIUM (Rudy. Swennen@geo. kuleuven. ac. be) INTRODUCTION Alluvial soils are often highly contaminated {{as a result of}} the overbank flooding or by the deposition of dredged sediments along the river. Therefore, alluvial soils may form important sinks of contaminated sediments. Because of the erosion of alluvial deposits or the release of contaminants from sediments, alluvial sediments can also be a source of contamination. In the study presented in this paper, a detailed characterisation of alluvial sediments in 3 regions in Belgium was carried out. Based on the physico-chemical sediment characteristics and the results of leaching tests, the risk for heavy metal release under changing environmental conditions was assessed. METHODOLOGY Sampling Alluvial sediments, consisting of overbank sediments or dredged sediment-derived soils were sampled along different rivers, in regions with different subsoil characteristics. 1) 	the Scheldt and Leie rivers (North-West Belgium), which are underlain by Tertiary sands and clays; 2) 	the Grote Beek (Demer catchment) and the Grote Laak (Nete catchment) rivers (North Belgium), underlain by the Diestian Formation, which consists of glauconite-rich medium-grained sands; 3) 	the Geul river (East Belgium), which flows in Upper Devonian sandstones and Lower and Middle Carboniferous carbonates and shales (Swennen et al., 1994). Alluvial sediments from the first two regions were contaminated (mainly with Zn, Cd, Pb, As) by industrial activities, whereas the accumulation of Cd, Zn and Pb in the overbank sediments of the Geul river is the result of mining activities (Swennen et al., 1994). Analysis All the analysis were performed on air-dried or oven-dried (30 °C) sediments. Total metal concentrations, pH, organic carbon content, grainsize distribution and CEC were determined in all the samples. Single extractions with EDTA 0. 05 M and CaCl 2 0. 01 M were performed on 91 samples according to the SMT- extraction protocol (Quevauviller, 1998). 26 sediments were selected for pHstat leaching tests with continuous setpoint titration with a Titro-Wico Multitirator (see Van Herreweghe et al. (2002) and Cappuyns et al. (2004) for more details). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Dredged sediment-derived soils along the Leie and Scheldt rivers are characterised by an elevated clay-, organic carbon and CaCO 3 -content and a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. The overbank sediments of the Grote Beek and Grote Laak contain elevated Fe-concentrations and a pH in the range of 6. 5 - 6. 9 and a variable clay- and organic carbon content. The alluvial sediments along the Geul have a loamy-sand texture, a low organic carbon content and a pH between 5. 3 and 6. 5. In the sediments of the grote Beek and the Geul rivers, the ‘mobile’ fraction of Cd and Zn (as determined with a CaCl 2 extraction) could be predicted by EDTA-extractable Cd- and Zn-concentrations, pH and organic carbon content (r= 0. 87 - 0. 95, = 0. 05). However, in the dredged sediment-derived soils with elevated CaCO 3 -concentrations, other parameters influenced the partitioning of Zn between the solid and the liquid phase. This may be a consequence of precipitation processes, which can result in relatively high metal levels in the solid phase which are not related to any of the soil constituents. Moreover, the considerable CaCO 3 -content results in an elevated acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) for these sediments (Fig. 1). Contrary, overbank sediments along the Geul river display a low ANC and CEC, yielding a lower retention of heavy metals compared to the CaCO 3 -rich sediments of the Scheldt and Leie rivers and the Fe-rich sediments from the Grote Beek and Grote Laak rivers. Fig. 1 : Acid neutralizing capacity (ANCpH 4) of alluvial sediments from the different rivers. CONCLUSION In order to be able to make predictions about the fate of contaminants in alluvial sediments, the most important parameters that control geochemical and microbiological processes (e. g. CEC, pH and acid neutralizing capacity, Eh, soil organic matter, salinity and microbiological activity, …), have to be determined. A region-based approach, in which regional (e. g. <b>geological</b> <b>subsoil)</b> and local (e. g. source of contamination) parameters are combined, can be a useful tool to group alluvial soils according to their potential risk to release contaminants.

40|$|National audienceHydrogeology {{and water}} balance in karst terrain Jacques Mudry Chrono-Environnement, Besançon (France) 1 Introduction Karst {{is defined as}} "all {{superficial}} and underground landforms produced by dissolution of specific rocks, mainly limestone". At the same time, it is a morphological structure (requiring thermodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions), a hydrosystem (input-box-output), and an aquifer (water resource, man impact, protection). Different academic specialties study karst: Physical Geography, Speleology, Geology, Hydraulics, Hydrogeochemistry, Pedology, and also engineering specialties: Geophysics, Hydrogeology, Geotechnics. Comprising external and internal landforms, karst is characterized by its internal draining pattern gathering water from up to downstream. This pattern originates in dissolution action on sedimentary and tectonic pre-existing discontinuities. This dissolution can be roughly synthetized by: CaCO 3 + CO 2 + H 2 O  Ca 2 + + HCO 3 - This equation requires CO 2 providers, sometimes deep gas (thermal karst), but mainly soil in the most common case of meteoric karst. As carbonates outcrop under various climates, karst is therefore widely dispread in the world. The common feature of all these contexts is this flow structuration on the pattern of enlarged fractures. This structuration transforms a rather homogeneous media into {{a more or less}} heterogeneous one, depending on geological duration of the process. 2 karst heterogeneity We can observe three types of heterogeneities in karst: (i) a vertical heterogeneity with epikarst and vadose zone vs saturated zone; (ii) a spatial one with conduits (karstified fractures) vs microfissured blocks; (iii) a heterogeneity of inputs with karrenfields with diffuse infiltration vs swallow holes with concentrated infiltration. Behavior of karst is strongly influenced by this heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst systems. 3 hydrodynamic and hydrochemical consequences Due to the existence of a decompressed-open shallow zone called epikarst, infiltration process is more complicated than in a classic inter granular media. Water fills first this first reservoir which recharges, by means of tectonic vertical discontinuities, the saturated zone. Due to the existence of very permeable conduits and lowly permeable microfissured blocks, water exchanges occur between both media, conduits recharging blocks during flood episodes, and blocks supplying conduits during low-water periods. This heterogeneity of functioning induces a scale effect: the bigger the system, the more permeable it is, because big lumps of limestone include bigger fractures than small ones. Another consequence concerns residence time. In karst, contrary to more homogeneous aquifers, a contrast between long residence time waters (tenths or hundreds of years), stored in blocks, and shortest transits (hour to day) can be displayed. This way of behavior, added to the structure of the draining pattern enables existence of the big karst springs, with high flood discharges (sometimes > 100 m 3 /s), but also with high depletion discharge (several m 3 /s). Existence of significant volumes (up to million m 3 /s), transiting the conduits induces 'piston-effect' which leads to yield 'pre-event' water at the beginning of floods. The consequence is a delayed mass transfer vs pressure transfer: water from the rainfall is not that flows at the spring at the discharge peak. Chemical composition of karst springs depends of the water transit through different media. The soil cover and the epikarst, submitted to evaporation, act as buffer for the hydrograph peak and marks water with characteristic tracers that are produced, stored or concentrated inside: e. g. chloride, provided by precipitations and concentrated by evaporation, and total organic carbon (TOC), produced by biological processes of pedogenesis. These tracers can be combined to the typical tracers of carbonate reservoir, e. g. magnesium and 13 C. As an example of transit time identification through vadose zone: the low-noise underground laboratory (LSBB, southeastern France) displays 1 month delay between rainfall and discharge peak in an artificial gallery, and 1 additional month for the infiltration itself to reach this point. Total: 2 months to pass vertically through 400 m of limestone. As an example of mixture identification in the saturated zone: the Fourbanne system (Jura mountains, Eastern France) displays well the behavior of the same water body, identified in a swallow hole by uranin tracing. This colored body is re-sampled within the conduit network, and finally in the general outlet of the system. As it is the same water, its chemical evolution will display mixtures with other components. The main results are that in the vadose conduit, the composition is similar to the input, and that the transit in the saturated zone involves a mixture with larger residence time water (making increase magnesium concentration), and poorer in agricultural tracers (making decrease nitrate concentration), probably infiltrated in forest areas, which has transited a larger time throughout the saturated zone. 4 Consequences for exploration and water protection In the context of coexistence of very and very low permeability, prospecting karst water resources is hard work. Historically, since the Antiquity, karst springs have been captured, but due to the easy drainage of conduits, often display low discharge in low water periods. Implementing boreholes requires remote sensing, in order to identify conductive fractures. But setting precisely a borehole is difficult, because geophysics does not meet high parameter contrasts. The main problem is that low permeability media are designed to propose equally probabilistic sites, but with a low exploitable discharge, whilst karst conduits, with potentially high exploitable yields are difficult to locate. Georadar may be a promising technique, mainly for shallow investigation. But the most permeable structures are also subjected to particle transit (turbidity) generally associated with microbiological problems (bacteria, viruses, protozoa), due to the insufficient transit time to kill these microorganisms. The relevant parameters for intrinsic vulnerability assessment are (i) the structure of rainfall episodes; (ii) the nature and thickness of the layers overlying the saturated zone (topsoil, <b>subsoil,</b> <b>geological</b> layers, unsaturated zone); (iii) the infiltration conditions (swallow hole, doline, karrens); and (iv) finally the importance of the karst conduit network. As an example a part of Besançon's resources, Arcier spring, tapped since 2 nd century, has been protected by 'leopard skin' zones: swallow holes, draining inhabited intake areas, are considered as very vulnerable spots protected by four remote immediate protection zones, as well as the spring itself. 5 Hydrologic balance In karst regions, meteorological cover of the recharge zones is often sparse, due to the lowly peopled catchment areas. Simple and parsimonious methods are required, {{in order to be able}} to use data measured in these stations. The most common relevant parameters measured in weather stations are precipitation and temperatures. Flowchart, using more complete dataset of bigger stations (solar radiation, wind [...] .), attempt to correlate these parameters with those of the local stations, and to reconstitute local series. Water balance in a Mediterranean mountain system (Fontaine de Vaucluse, Southeastern France), shows that actual ET is rather constant according to altitude belts, and therefore that increase of raw precipitation with altitude induces a parallel increase of effective rainfall. The highest altitude belts of the recharge area account therefore much more than the lowest ones in the water balance of the system. The consequence is the prominent role of karst mountains in the recharge of piedmont granular aquifers. As an example: the molassic Valence plain, Southeastern France. Most of the resource of the lower aquifer is provided by effective rainfall in the karst aquifer bordering it. This is particularly significant in semiarid or arid zones, as in the Saharan Atlas, in Southern Algeria, where the limestone, due to its high altitude, displays more rainfall and lower temperatures. Added with existence of shallow soils, effective rainfalls are very important for the recharge of piedmont aquifers. Estimating effective rainfalls requires the knowledge of the recharge zone. If the lowest altitude of this zone is known (that of the spring), estimating its maximum altitude is necessary, in order to map the recharge area. Stable isotopes enable to evaluate average altitude of the recharge zone, and the problem is that this average includes contribution of upper zones, rainier, and lower zones, less rainy. Accounting for the rain and the stable isotope gradients, we can estimate the highest zone of the recharge area, using a set of equations. 6 Conclusion Heterogeneous in its structure, in its residence times, in its vulnerability, in its ability to provide drinking water, the karst aquifer is a very interesting aquifer, as well as a scientific object as an economic and societal one. But this aquifer is probably the most difficult to study, and therefore to exploit for drinking water and finally to protect...|$|R
