30|$|Generally the {{performance}} of ML bit synchronization {{is determined by the}} number of bit transitions, not the absolute number of bits. For the most common case that bit transition happens with a probability equal to 50 %, a higher SSR, a lower C/N 0 and a higher Doppler frequency error all require more data bits.

30|$|In weak GNSS signal environments, {{extending}} {{integration time}} is paramount {{to improving the}} GNSS receiver’s sensitivity. Furthermore, sufficient coherent integration can help to mitigate multipath and cross-correlation false locks and avoid squaring loss. However, extending integration time {{is limited by the}} navigation message data bit, if present. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method has been shown as {{the most effective way to}} estimate the navigation bit boundary locations (i.e., bit synchronization) and subsequently estimate the data bit values (i.e., bit decoding) in the presence of noise alone. In this paper, the performance of ML bit synchronization and decoding is systematically assessed as a function of the number of data bits, the effect of <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> and received signal power in different tracking modes (i.e., phase-locked mode and frequency-locked mode). In addition, the theoretical performance models of ML bit synchronization and decoding are developed based on statistical theory. The experimental validation of the developed performance models and analyses is reported. For GPS L 1 C/A signals, it is shown that for ML bit synchronization, using 100 data bits, the successful synchronization rate (SSR) can reach to about 100 % with C/N 0 as low as 20  dB-Hz with no <b>Doppler</b> <b>error.</b> The performance degradation caused by <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> is not significant if the <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> is within 5  Hz, and with the maximum tolerance of 25  Hz, while for ML bit decoding, the successful decoding rate (SDR) of the 2 -bit sequence can reach to about 100 % with C/N 0 as low as 25  dB-Hz with no <b>Doppler</b> <b>error.</b> The performance degradation caused by <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> is not significant if the <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> is within 2  Hz.

The model can reproduce the observed distribution of radial velocity variation over a range of parameter values, but, for the expected level of <b>Doppler</b> systematic <b>error,</b> the highest Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities occur for a power-law index alpha ~ 4, indicating that rocky-metal planets dominate the planet population in this size range.

30|$|Based on {{the results}} {{discussed}} above, there are three recommended schemes for implementing the ML bit synchronizer in a GNSS receiver. First, choose different numbers of bits for synchronization according to current signal power and the possible <b>Doppler</b> <b>errors</b> (the effect of <b>Doppler</b> <b>errors</b> will be introduced later). This scheme is efficient to achieve bit synchronization, but the tradeoff {{is that it is}} vulnerable to the bit sequence without bit transitions. A method detecting if bit transitions existed was reported in [12] by a hypothesis testing. The bit boundary will be declared if the ratio between the cross-correlation output from the candidate of the boundary position (maximum value) and the output from the candidate shifted by 10  ms (supposed minimum value) passes a certain threshold. Second, choose a relatively large number of bits for synchronization no matter the values of signal power and other parameters. This scheme is the easiest to be implemented but is less efficient and requires longer time for bit synchronization. Third, choose the number of bits either according to current parameters (e.g., estimated C/N 0) or fixed as one trial, but do not declare the position of the bit boundaries unless the certain number of continuously successful trials is achieved. This scheme can increase the reliability of synchronization results but also increase the system complexity as a tradeoff.|$|R

40|$|Refraction of the {{acoustic}} beam from a sodar, or {{translation of the}} beam due to the wind (known as wind drift), both affect the scattering angle and hence the Doppler shift of the return signal. Wind drift {{has been the subject}} of a number of previous studies, which have shown that errors increase with wind speed, giving about 6 [*]% error in the estimated wind speed when the actual wind speed is 7 [*]ms− 1. Since previous studies have not treated the general case of finite angular beam width, a new analytic treatment is given here for monostatic sodars. Surprisingly, it is found that the <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> contributed by the transmitted beam is exactly compensated by the <b>Doppler</b> <b>error</b> contributed by the received beam, if the two beam widths are the same. If the transmitter beam width is not equal to the receiver beam width, then either over-estimation or under-estimation of wind speed results, depending on which beam is wider. This has implications for bi-static sodars, in which it is not possible to match beam widths. Contrary to this new theory, examples of field comparisons with mast instrumentation show a non-linear relationship between wind speeds measured by a sodar and wind speeds measured by mast-mounted instruments. It is proposed that this is due to {{the acoustic}} baffle clipping the received beam and changing its width, since the received beam must return at lower elevations from scattering downwind. This is shown to be feasible for a Metek sodar. The sign and magnitude of the observed non-linear dependence of estimated wind speed on actual wind speed are consistent with this proposed mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Strong ionospheric {{electron}} content gradients {{may lead}} to fast and unpredictable fluctuations in the phase and amplitude of the signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This phenomenon, known as ionospheric scintillation, is capable of deteriorating the tracking performance of a GNSS receiver, leading to increased phase and <b>Doppler</b> <b>errors,</b> cycle slips and also to complete losses of signal lock. In order to mitigate scintillation effects at receiver level, the robustness of the carrier tracking loop, the receiver weakest link under scintillation, must be enhanced. Kalman Filter (KF) based tracking algorithms are particularly suitable {{to cope with the}} variable working conditions imposed by scintillation. However, the effectiveness of this tracking approach strongly depends on the accuracy of the assumed dynamic model, which can quickly become inaccurate under randomly variable situations. This study first shows how inaccurate dynamic models can lead to a KF suboptimum solution or divergence, when both strong phase and amplitude scintillation are present. Then, to overcome this issue, it proposes two self-tuning KF based carrier tracking algorithms, which self-tune their dynamic models by exploiting the knowledge about scintillation that can be achieved through scintillation monitoring.
