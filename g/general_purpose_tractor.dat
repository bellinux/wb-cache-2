Their tractors were marketed using the “Terra” prefix before a descriptive term. The bulldozers {{were referred to}} as Terra Dozers, the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>tractors</b> Terra Tracs and the backhoes Terra Hoes. ATC was purchased by the J.I.

40|$|The {{history of}} western {{economic}} growth, especially North American, has been strongly influenced by farm mechanization. The dramatic increase in productivity which enabled {{the support of a}} hugely declining agricultural work force is due to a large extent to the arrival of motorization. In this, tractors, {{one of the most important}} components of a farm, have played a fundamental role. In this paper we identify a major technological breakthrough in the American tractor industry and test the hypothesis that it influenced firms’ survival. Based on the concepts of dominant designs and technology cycles our work aims to understand the mechanism behind the birth of new technologies that pushed agriculture forward. We focus our analysis on the early years of this industry, when most innovation happened and the dominant design emerged. We use the generalized gamma model and control for the effects of population density, market size, business cycles and entry timing. We consider both the complete set of data for the whole industry as well as the submarkets of <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>tractors</b> and garden tractors. The results show that firms that entered the industry in the initial development phase, have a much lower expected duration than the remaining firms. Many of these firms may have spent a lot of resources in experimentation during a non-standardized and low volume phase of the industry. For given values of the control variables, the firms that entered after the dominant design have the highest expected duration...|$|R

5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} light-weight petrol-powered <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>tractor</b> {{was built}} by Dan Albone, a British inventor in 1901. He filed for a patent on 15 February 1902 for his tractor design and then formed Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited. The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor; the word [...] "tractor" [...] did not come into common use until later. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel, with solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A pulley wheel on the left hand side allowed it {{to be used as}} a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300. His tractor won a medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used.|$|E
