IGN gave the show a rating of three out of ten, stating that [...] "to fully appreciate this series one must have a tolerance for clunky, mechanical animation (the kind that says [...] "We really didn't spend too much money on it") and a love for '80s-style action;" [...] and that [...] "it offers little in terms of character development.

50|$|So, Danny and {{his father}} are at odds a lot and, as a result, the teen indulges {{in a lot of}} trouble, {{particularly}} a night of joyriding drunk and hitting a police car, which is what lands him in trouble.

Meanwhile, his father gets a job in Ohio and the family has to move. At his trial the assault charges are dropped and he is charged only with drunk driving and operating without a license. He is sentenced as time served and released. His parents realize the mistake of leaving their son in jail and tell the people in the courtroom that they really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change how they treat children that come to them. Danny returns home to his family and their home but is forever changed by his time in jail.|$|R
