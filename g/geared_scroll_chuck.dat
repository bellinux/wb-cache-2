2500|$|Usually in shop-floor terminology, {{the terms}} collet and chuck {{are used in}} contradistinction; users speak of holding a {{workpiece}} or tool with either a collet or a chuck. In this context [...] "chuck" [...] means any type of chuck other than a collet <b>chuck</b> (<b>scroll</b> <b>chuck,</b> independent-jaw chuck, etc.).|$|R
50|$|A {{self-centering}} chuck, {{also known}} as a , uses dogs (usually called jaws), interconnected via a <b>scroll</b> <b>gear</b> (<b>scroll</b> plate), to hold onto a tool or workpiece. Because they most often have three jaws, the term three-jaw chuck without other qualification is understood by machinists to mean a self-centering three-jaw chuck. The term universal chuck also refers to this type. These chucks are best suited to grip circular or hexagonal cross-sections when very fast, reasonably accurate (±0.005 inch mm TIR) centering is desired.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed jaw and one movable jaw (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering <b>scroll</b> <b>chucks.</b> They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R
50|$|Face cams {{may provide}} {{repetitive}} motion with a groove that forms a closed curve, or may provide function generation with a stopped groove. Cams used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions {{to cover the}} complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the scroll plate in a <b>scroll</b> <b>chuck.</b> Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the above}} traits, <b>scroll</b> <b>chucks</b> offer always № 1 and № 2; usually № 3; to varying extents № 4 (depending on the situation); but not {{reliably}} № 5. Independent-jaw chucks offer always № 3; usually № 4; reliably № 5 (but {{at the expense}} of paying a skilled user to spend time achieving it); never № 2; and generally not № 1. Meanwhile, a collet chuck can deliver all reliably, and with no need for a skilled user (№s 3 to 5 do depend on the object being clamped closely matching {{the size and shape of}} the collet's clamping surface. This constraint is usually not a problem when the object is good-quality bar stock; the shank of a well maintained drill bit, reamer, end mill, etc.; or a previously machined part that is being rechucked for additional cutting operations).|$|R
50|$|The wood rotates {{between the}} {{headstock}} of the lathe {{which includes the}} drive mechanism and the tailstock support, which only rotates if its center is 'live' or supported by a rotating holding device. The headstock end may use points or spurs which are driven into the wood. This type of turning is described as 'between centers.' The headstock spindle may also use a cup, collet, or a <b>scroll</b> <b>chuck</b> to hold a tenon on the workpiece which will be removed in the finished product. The wood can also be screwed or glued to a faceplate—a strong disk that is threaded to mount on the headstock's spindle. The use of a chuck or faceplate allows the woodturner to forego tailstock support for the rotating wood. This type of secure holding system is essential for hollowing bowls or hollow forms.|$|R

5000|$|Names {{known to}} {{figure in the}} history of chuck {{development}} include those of Simon Fairman (1792-1857) and his son-in-law Austin F. Cushman (1830-1914), and Arthur Irving Jacobs. Fairman invented the piece of tooling that we today would call a <b>scroll</b> <b>chuck,</b> and Cushman developed and sold this design under his business, Cushman Industries. Judging from a historical sketch given by the Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company(a well-known brand in the drill chuck field), Arthur I. (A.I.) Jacobs was apparently the person who further developed Cushmans self-centering scroll-gear idea into the type of drill chuck known today (for which his company would later become famous). A.I. Jacobss patent of 1902 (...) appears to be the principal patent. The term [...] "drill chuck" [...] clearly did not originate with him, but his new type of drill chuck evidently long ago displaced any earlier types that lacked the angled jaw movement and outer sleeve now found on all common drill chucks.|$|R
50|$|Reward: Fishing <b>gear</b> and a <b>scroll</b> {{to be read}} {{later for}} the first winning tribe, as well as getting back all items stolen from their camp. The second winning tribe would have only three of their lost items returned. All tribes that {{finished}} the challenge, regardless of placing, would also take home the rice that they saved during the challenge.|$|R
