40|$|AbstractThe paper aims at {{demonstrating that}} the {{consideration}} of constant start-up costs and ramps of the thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> for assessing the contribution of pumped-hydro energy storage to reduce the scheduling costs of hydrothermal power systems with high wind penetration, may yield unrealistic results. For this purpose, an isolated power system {{is used as a}} case study. The contribution of a pumped-storage hydropower plant to reduce the system scheduling costs is assessed in the paper by using a hydrothermal weekly unit commitment model. The model considers different start-up costs and ramps of the thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> {{as a function of the}} start-up type. The effects of including pumped hydro energy storage in the system on the integration of wind energy, and on the start-ups and capacity factors of the thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> are also evaluated. The results of the paper demonstrate that {{the consideration of}} constant start-up costs and ramps of the thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> yields unrealistic results, and that the pumped-storage hydropower plant may help reduce the system scheduling costs by 2. 5 – 11 % and integrate wind power and may allow dispensing with some inflexible thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
