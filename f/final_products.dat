5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in <b>final</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as <b>final</b> <b>products</b> {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E

5|$|The press {{reported}} weekly on {{the building}} of Boydell's gallery, designed by George Dance the Younger, on a site in Pall Mall. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as Joshua Reynolds, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations {{had to be done}} by lesser artists, the <b>final</b> <b>products</b> of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to <b>final</b> <b>products</b> by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a royalty rate of $1 per unit. The royalty only applies to <b>final</b> <b>products</b> {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI product that is already subject to the royalty. For example, an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV.|$|E

5000|$|Process: Mass-production {{processes}} are often unsuitable {{for making a}} small number of parts, so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the <b>final</b> <b>product.</b> For example, a <b>final</b> <b>product</b> that will be made by plastic injection molding will require expensive custom tooling, so a prototype for this product may be fabricated by machining or stereolithography instead.

5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the <b>final</b> <b>products</b> entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E

25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the <b>final</b> <b>products</b> are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).|$|E

To avoid any inconsistencies, the <b>final</b> <b>products</b> are tested in the Lijjat's {{laboratory}} in Mumbai. In the monthly meetings, the quality issue and modifications are tested. The central office purchases and distributes all ingredients to maintain the quality of the final product. For example, the urad dal is imported from Myanmar, asafetida is imported from Afghanistan, and black pepper comes from Kerala. The committee often makes surprise visits to various branches to assure that production conditions are hygienic. When a new branch of Lijjat opens, a neighbouring Lijjat branch helps it by guiding and training new members.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of {{producing}} objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product {{before moving on to}} learn the skills of producing something else.

The perfected <b>final</b> <b>products</b> were kept as a special reminder and never used.
