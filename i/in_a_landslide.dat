5|$|Greeley {{was the new}} Liberal Republican Party's {{candidate}} in the 1872 U.S. presidential election. He lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party. He was devastated {{by the death of}} his wife, who died five days before the election, and died himself three weeks later, before the electoral college had met.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b> Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In February 1884, the Impeachment {{trial of}} Prime Minister Christian Selmer and his entire cabinet was nearing its end.

5|$|Initial {{news reports}} stated that Kirogi {{produced}} deadly flooding in the Philippines; however, {{the storm was}} {{too far from the}} country to have any impacts. In Japan, Kirogi produced torrential rainfall and high winds, killing five people and leaving 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD) in damages. Flooding inundated nearly 1,300 homes around Tokyo and high winds cut power to roughly 20,000 residences. Three homes were destroyed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> on Kozushima.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{stepped down}} as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too {{inflexible}} and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President.

In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. Military authorities considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to Thomas E. Bramlette <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parker {{also became}} active with the Democratic Party {{and was an}} early {{supporter}} of future New York governor and US President Grover Cleveland.

Blaine in the fall election. During this time, Parker also became a protege of David B. Hill, managing Hill's 1884 gubernatorial campaign; Hill won <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parker's attacks {{came too}} late to turn the election, however. On November 8, Roosevelt won <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> of 7,630,457 votes to Parker's 5,083,880. Roosevelt carried every {{northern}} and western state, including Missouri, {{for a total of}} 336 electoral votes; Parker carried only the traditionally Democratic Solid South, accumulating 140 electoral votes.

5|$|The most {{significantly}} affected area was Veracruz, where damage reached over $1billion pesos ($92million 2007USD).

5|$|The {{subsequent}} elections {{took place}} in December 1944, and were broadly considered free and fair, although only literate men were given the vote. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. Arévalo's closest challenger was Adrián Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. The ballots were tallied on 19 December 1944, and Arévalo won <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> receiving {{more than four times}} as many ballots as the other candidates combined.|$|E
5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the {{concession}} was given construction of the railway had already started. At the most 2,000 workers {{were involved in the}} construction of the plant, the Rjukan Line, and the Tinnoset Line. This was in addition to the Svelgfoss Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden. During the construction one worker lost his life <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota.

In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
