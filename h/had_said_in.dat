25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} publicized event in Berkeley was the People's Park protest in 1969, {{which was a}} {{conflict}} between the university {{and a number of}} Berkeley students and city residents over a plot of land on which the university intended to construct athletic fields. A grassroots effort by students and residents turned it into a community park, but after a few weeks, the university decided to reclaim control over the property. Law enforcement was sent in and the park was bulldozed, setting off a protest. California governor Ronald Reagan — who <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his gubernatorial election campaign that he would clean up the perceived unruliness at Berkeley and other university campuses — called in National Guard troops and more violence erupted, resulting in over a dozen people hospitalized, a police officer stabbed, a bystander blinded, and the death of one student. The university ultimately decided not to develop People's Park, though it remains the owner of the property.|$|E
25|$|When {{it became}} public in 1999 that Crown Prince Willem-Alexander was in {{relationship}} with Máxima Zorreguieta, the royal house came under fire, mainly because Máxima's father Jorge Zorreguieta had been Secretary of State in the repressive Argentinian military regime of Jorge Videla during the Dirty War (1976–1981). Even {{before there was}} any official announcement of a marriage, Democrats 66 (D66) and especially GreenLeft and the Socialist Party (SP) responded critically, and demanded Máxima to publicly distance herself from the Argentinian regime {{to be allowed to}} marry Willem-Alexander. In 1997, Willem-Alexander <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> an interview that if Parliament would not approve his choice of bride, he would relinquish his kingship. Research showed that popular interest in Máxima was limited, and one found there was too much media coverage about the revelation; initially, one half of the Dutch people favoured a potential marriage, the other half opposed. Sociologist Pim Fortuyn wrote that the issue illustrated 'that the royal house is an institute from a past age'. In January 2000, the royal house still officially denied any marriage was in preparation.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of his crash Kubica was unable to race at the next Grand Prix in the United States.

This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams.

500|$|Bird did {{not limit}} himself to {{challenging}} his future brother-in-law. [...] In 1834, Bird and Brett published {{a paper on}} the analysis of blood serum and urine, in which they argued against some work by Prout. [...] Prout <b>had</b> <b>said</b> (<b>in</b> 1819) that the pink sediment in urine {{was due to the}} presence of ammonium purpurate, but Bird's tests failed to verify this. [...] Though Bird was still only a student and Prout held great authority, Prout felt it necessary to reply to the challenge. [...] In 1843, Bird tried to identify the pink compound; he failed, but was convinced it was a new chemical and gave it the name purpurine. [...] This name did not stick, however, and the compound became known as uroerythrin from the work of Franz Simon. [...] Its structure was finally identified only in 1975.|$|E
500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E

Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying [...] "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E

He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie [...] "longed" [...] for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, had just had a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog [...] "Checkers". Nixon decided that including the anecdote evoking FDR would needle his enemies and delight his friends.|$|E

500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Sunil Gavaskar <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his match {{report that}} the batsmen will be {{required}} to play more on the front foot because of the inconstant bounce. The pitch was patchy, and Warne chose to field first. The Super Kings lost its first batsman as Sivaramakrishnan went out for 16 runs. He was caught by Ravindra Jadeja when Pathan was up. Sivaramakrishnan pulled a fast ball to deep mid-wicket, and Jadeja took a [...] "well-judged catch". Sivaramakrishnan made 16 runs in 14 balls at a strike rate of 114.28, and played an opening partnership of 39 runs with P. Patel. After that, Raina joined P. Patel, and both of them made 25 runs for the second wicket partnership with a run rate of 6.81. P. Patel was caught in the last ball of the ninth over. Similar to the previous wicket, Pathan bowled a flat and fast ball, P. Patel tried to play it towards the third man. However, the ball edged towards the wicket-keeper Akmal, who initially dropped the ball, but caught it afterwards. P. Patel made 38 runs in 33 balls and hit five boundaries. The next wicket was of Albie Morkel, who made 16 runs out of 13 balls. Pathan again bowled a flat fast ball, which was top edged by Morkel. The ball went into the air, and was eventually caught by Akmal. However this resulted in the collision of Akmal and Mohammad Kaif as both were trying to take the catch, and both of them got injured. Four overs later, Jadeja caught Raina on Watson, breaking a 33 runs fourth wicket partnership between him and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Watson bowled a full length ball outside off stump. Raina played it towards long off, but failed to get enough distance and Jadeja caught the ball at the boundary. Chamara Kapugedera joined Dhoni after the dismissal of Raina, a decision which [...] "punctured" [...] the momentum in the slog overs. Kapugedera made eight runs by acing 12 balls, before being caught by Swapnil Asnodkar on Sohail Tanvir. Tanvir bowled an angling slower ball, which was lofted on the front foot by Kapugedera. The ball was caught by long-on fielder Asnodkar. With the last five balls remaining in the innings, Dhoni and Subramaniam Badrinath together made 15 runs, and Badrinath made six runs off two balls. Dhoni made 29 runs not out, facing 17 balls, in which he hit two fours and one six. Pathan had the best figures with the ball for the Royals, as he took three wickets for 22 runs in four overs. Tanvir and Watson got one wicket each and gave 40 and 29 runs respectively. Warne gave 34 runs in his four overs, but failed to get any wicket. Munaf Patel and Siddharth Trivedi gave 14 and 21 runs respectively in their two overs each.|$|E
