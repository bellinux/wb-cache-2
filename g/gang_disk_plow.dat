40|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>plows</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (reversible) <b>disk</b> <b>plows</b> can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the <b>plow,</b> a <b>disk</b> angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries.

40|$|Tillage {{systems are}} {{a key element of}} the {{technology}} of crop production, both with a view to crop yield and from the perspective of soil conservation and sustainability of the production system. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects of five tillage systems on the physical properties of a cohesive Yellow Argisol. The experiment was installed in the field on January 21, 2011 and lasted 260 days, in an area previously used as pasture with Brachiaria grass without liming or fertilization, but irrigated by a low pressure spray system. The treatments, in five replications and in a randomized block design, consisted of: 1) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + ridge-furrow tillage (raising a ridge along the planting row), 135 days after transplanting (DP + RID); 2) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow (DP no RID); 3) subsoiler (SB); 4) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks along the plant row (DP + SPR); and 5) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks in the total area (DP + STA). In all tillage systems, furrows were mechanically opened for the papaya plants. After the treatments, the mechanical resistance to penetration was determined, followed by soil moisture, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), bulk density (BD), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), and number of fruits per plant. There were differences in penetration resistance (PR) between treatments. The subsoiler was more effective to decrease RP to a distance of 0. 35 m from the plants, perpendicular to the plant row. The scarifier resulted in a lower PR than DP or SB, even at the depth of 0. 40 m, and it was more effective at greater distances perpendicular to the plant. All tillage systems induced a PR between 2. 0 and 3. 0 MPa at the depth with the highest concentration of papaya tree roots (0 - 0. 25 m), improving the physical conditions to this depth. There was no statistical difference among the treatments for BD, Ma, Mi, MWD, and GMD at a depth of 0. 20 m. The <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> changed the physical properties of the soil most intensely to a depth of 0. 20 m. The use of scarification, reduced tillage with a forest subsoiler, or ridge-furrow tillage did not improve the physical properties in the rhizosphere.

40|$|Introduction: Mulch tillage {{system is}} an {{intermediate}} system which covers some of disadvantages of no tillage and conventional tillage systems. In farms in which tillage {{is done with}} a chisel plow, runoff and soil erosion have a less important relation to moldboard and <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and naturally absorption of rainfall will be developed. Thus, the mulch tillage system is an appropriate alternative to conventional tillage and no tillage (Backingham and Pauli, 1993). The unwanted vibration in machinery and industry mainly processes most harmful factors, for example: bearing wear, cracking and loosening joints. And noise is produced in electrical systems by creating a short circuit (Wok, 2011). Self-induced and induced vibration are used in tillage systems. Induced vibration is created by energy consumption and self-induced vibration is created by collision among the blades and soil at the shank (Soeharsono and Setiawan, 2010). A study by Mohammadi-gol et al. (2005) was conducted. It was found that on the <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> plant residues maintained on the soil are more than that of moldboard plow. 99...|$|R

A pin microrelief meter was used for the surface roughness measurements. The plot area was 1. 35 × 1. 35 m and the sample spacing was 25 mm, yielding a total of 3, 025 data points per measurement. Before geostatistical analysis, trend was removed from the experimental data by two methods for comparison.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content.

The {{potential impact of}} these externalities on environmental quality and human health prompted an examination of current and potential production strategies on four important dryfarmed soil associations [...] Walla Walla, Pilot Rock, Ritzville and Athena Soils [...] in the Umatilla County area of Oregon. The objective was to evaluate the economic and environmental costs of reducing soil erosion and leaching through implementing strategies that minimize soil loss and (or) nitrate leaching or offer some trade-offs between the pollutants. Four models [...] the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Micro-computer Budgeting Management System (MBMS), Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Program (NLEAP) and Multi-Objective Linear programming (MOP) [...] were employed to accomplish the study objectives. The results revealed that production strategies that focused on reducing only one pollutant generally exacerbated the other. The mixed objective strategies achieved a simultaneous reduction in both soil erosion and leaching. Once either pollutant had been substantially reduced, further reductions certainly increased the rate of generation of the other. On Walla Walla soil, the most cost effective erosion reducing strategies for winter wheat production included those that involved use of chisel plow for primary tillage under standard conservation practice. Large leachate reductions in winter wheat production were possible by using strategies that involved use of <b>disk</b> <b>plowing</b> for primary tillage followed by chisel plow for secondary tillage and a split fertilizer application. On Pilot Rock soil, production process that involved use of sweep plow for primary tillage with a one time spring fertilizer application and (or) with more farm acreage in spring barley production were least cost strategies that reduced leaching considerably. Soil loss and leaching rates on Ritzville soils were very low, indicating that this soil may {{not be subject to}} soil erosion or leaching problems.

40|$|Due to {{continued}} machinery, soil mobilization has caused considerable changes in both soil bulk density (physical attributes) and organic C content, risking crop yield reduction and negative environmental effects. In this context, this work aimed at assessing changes in both physical attributes and in organic C {{content of a}} Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo surface horizon, subjected to no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage with <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (DP), heavy harrow (HG), and disc plow plus harrow (DP+HG) for 23 years. A natural forest fragment (NF) was used as reference area. A randomized-block design with 8 x 12 m plots and four replications was used. Soil samples were collected at 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20, and 20 - 40 cm depths {{in order to assess}} soil density, total organic carbon content, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and aggregate stability. Results showed that continued cultivation increases soil physical degradation, as evidenced by both macro porosity and total porosity reduction, aggregate stability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, total organic carbon, and soil density increase. The NT was found to best contribute to soil physical properties improvement and total organic carbon recovery in 0 - 5 cm surface layer...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar sistemas de {{manejo de}} solo e de rotação de culturas sobre o rendimento de grãos e componentes do rendimento de soja durante seis anos. Foram comparados quatro sistemas de manejo de solo - 1) plantio direto, 2) cultivo mínimo, no inverno e semeadura direta, no verão, 3) preparo convencional de solo com arado de discos, no inverno e semeadura direta, no verão e 4) preparo convencional de solo com arado de aivecas, no inverno e semeadura direta, no verão - e três sistemas de rotação de culturas: sistema I (trigo/soja), sistema II (trigo/soja e ervilhaca/milho ou sorgo) e sistema III (trigo/soja, ervilhaca/milho ou sorgo e aveia branca/soja). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi de blocos ao acaso, com parcelas subdivididas e três repetições. O rendimento de grãos e o peso de 1. 000 grãos de soja cultivada sob plantio direto e sob cultivo mínimo foi superior ao de soja cultivada sob preparo convencional de solo com arado de discos e com arado de aivecas. A maior estatura de plantas de soja ocorreu no plantio direto. O rendimento de grãos de soja cultivada após trigo, no sistema II, foi superior ao de soja cultivada após aveia branca e após trigo, no sistema III, e após trigo, no sistema I. O menor rendimento de grãos, peso de grãos por planta de soja e peso de 1. 000 grãos ocorreu quando em monocultura (trigo/soja). The {{objective of this}} six-year study {{was to assess the}} soil tillage systems and crop rotation systems on soybean grain and yield components were evaluated at Embrapa Trigo in Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil. Four soil tillage systems - 1) no-tillage, 2) minimum tillage in winter and no-tillage in summer, 3) conventional tillage with <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> in winter and no-tillage in summer, and 4) tillage using a moldboard plow in winter and no-tillage in summer - and three crop rotation systems [system I (wheat/soybean), system II (wheat/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum), and system III (wheat/soybean, common vetch/corn or sorghum and white oats/soybean) ]. An experimental randomized blocks design, with split-plots and three replications, was used. The yield and weight of 1, 000 kernels of soybean grown under no-tillage and minimum tillage was higher than soybean grown conventional soil tillage with <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and a moldboard plow. Plant height showed higher in the no-tillage. The yield of soybean grown after wheat, in system II, was higher than soybean grown after white oats and after wheat, in system III, and after wheat, in system I.

40|$|Desenvolveu-se de 1997 a 2003, em Passo Fundo (RS), um experimento constituído de quatro sistemas de {{manejo de}} solo (plantio direto, cultivo mínimo, preparo convencional de solo com arado de discos e preparo convencional de solo com arado de aivecas) e de três sistemas de rotação de culturas: sistema I (trigo/soja); sistema II (trigo/soja e ervilhaca/milho ou sorgo) e sistema III (trigo/soja, ervilhaca/milho ou sorgo e aveia branca/soja). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de blocos ao acaso, com parcelas subdivididas e três repetições. A parcela principal foi constituída pelos sistemas de manejo de solo, e as subparcelas, pelos sistemas de rotação de culturas. Neste trabalho, apresentam-se a conversão energética (energia disponível/energia consumida) e o balanço energético (energia disponível - energia consumida) no período de 7 anos. No sistema plantio direto houve conversão e balanço energéticos (72, 44 e 190. 766 MJ ha- 1) superiores ao cultivo mínimo (64, 06 e 167. 349 MJ ha- 1), aos preparos convencionais de solo com arado de discos (54, 35 e 134. 982 MJ ha- 1) e com arado de aivecas (52, 02 e 128. 159 MJ ha- 1) respectivamente. O trigo em rotação de culturas foi mais eficiente energeticamente do que a monocultura desse cereal. Na cultura de milho foi observada maior eficiência energética. The effects of soil management systems and crop rotations were assessed from 1997 to 2003, in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Four soil management systems (no-tillage, minimum tillage, conventional tillage using <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> and conventional tillage using moldboard plow) and three crop rotation systems [system I (wheat/soybean), system II (wheat/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum), and system III (wheat/soybean, common vetch/corn or sorghum and white oats/soybean) ] were compared. An experimental design of blocks at random with split-plots and three replications was used. The main plot consisted of soil management systems, while the split-plots consisted of crop rotation systems. Energy conversion (energy available/energy consumed) and balance (energy available - energy consumed) during a seven-year period {{is presented in}} this paper. No-tillage showed higher energy conversion and balance (72. 44 and 190, 766 MJ ha- 1) than minimum tillage (64. 06 and 167, 349 MJ ha- 1), conventional tillage using <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (54. 35 and 134, 982 MJ ha- 1), and conventional tillage using moldboard (52. 02 and 128, 159 MJ ha- 1), respectively. Wheat within crop rotations presented higher energy efficiency in energy than the monoculture of this cereal. The corn crop was observed the highest energy efficiency of this study...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{features}} of {{the facade of the}} Design Hub is that it has the capability of collecting solar energy throughout most of the day as the surface is covered in operable disks. Although, as of 2013, there are no solar panels installed, it has the capability to accommodate this technology in the near future with its facade system. To achieve harvesting energy at an optimum level, <b>ganged</b> <b>disks</b> are fitted with an actuator which will allows the disks to be exposed to the sun as much as possible. With the current material of sandblasted glass, the disks operate as a 'second skin' controlling solar gain and access. An internal computer controls this facade by adjusting each cell with rotational motors, according to Melbourne’s daily weather. Additional self-sustaining features include the underground water tank, which stores grey water for re-use including flushing toilets, mechanical cooling requirements, and irrigation.|$|R

40|$|Tillage {{systems and}} organic manures could affect soil {{physical}} and mechanical properties. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate the impacts of two tillage systems including conventional tillage by moldboard plowing (plowing depth, 30 cm) and reduced tillage by <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (plowing depth, 15 cm) and three rates (0, 30 and 60 ton ha- 1) of farmyard manure (FYM) on the soil penetration resistance under corn cropping in a split block design with 3 replications. The cone index (CI) decreased with increase of the tillage depth. It is attributable to soil disturbing and loosening of the deeper layers under conventional tillage compared to reduced tillage. This trend, however, was observed only in the first (after treatments’ application and before cropping) and second (the highest rate of vegetative growth) samplings. In the third sampling (after harvest), there were not significant differences between the CI values under two tillage systems in different soil depths. It might be due to soil re-compaction (approaching the pre-tillage state) as well as disappearance of the tillage effects seven month after commencement of the experiment. In fact, the soil mechanical resistance increased with the time indicating soil re-compaction over the growing season. Adding FYM to the surface layer (i. e. 0 - 10 cm) of ridge soil resulted in significant decrease of soil mechanical resistance compared to control treatment. The CI decreased significantly in the 30 ton ha- 1 treatment up to the stage of highest rate of vegetative grow, but the effect on CI was diminished after harvest. However, the decreasing effects of the 60 ton ha- 1 treatment on the CI continued to the harvesting time. There were no significant effects of FYM in the soil deeper than 10 cm from the ridge surface and in all of the layers in furrow. The CI did not decrease significantly in the furrow due to negligible effect of manure application for the inter-row position...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Cerrado {{soils are}} acid and {{deficient}} in calcium and magnesium, which limit crop growth. Also, there is aluminum toxicity for plant roots being necessary using lime {{to overcome these}} conditions. The effects of lime levels and methods of lime application in a Red Latosol, were evaluated. A soybean and corn crop rotation were settled, under conventional (<b>disk</b> <b>plowing</b> and harrowing) and no-tillage planting systems, for four years. Cover crops were planted in the dry season, mucuna cultivated after soybean and millet after corn. One lime treatment was included without cover crop under the conventional system. The occurrence of a dry spell period reduced the soybean yield in the first crop, but yield increases were observed due to lime application, under both systems, {{in the second and}} fourth crop with corn and third crop with soybean. In the beginning, grain yields were higher under the conventional cropping system. With no-tillage, lime levels without incorporation produced less corn grain yield as compared to incorporated lime. The corn response to split lime application was proportional to the incorporated lime levels. The exclusion of cover crops under the conventional system promoted corn grain yield reduction. Surface lime applications affected the soil chemical characteristics mainly at the 0 cm - 5 cm depth. 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} crop {{rotation}} systems (CRS) on soybean yield and agronomic characteristics were evaluated from 1996 / 1997 to 2010 / 2011 at Embrapa Trigo, Passo Fundo (RS), Brazil. Four soil management systems (SMS) were compared, namely: 1) no tillage, 2) minimum tillage, 3) conventional tillage using a <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and a <b>disk</b> harrow, and 4) conventional using a moldboard and a disk harrow - and three CRS: system I (wheat/soybean), system II (wheat/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum) and system III (wheat/soybean, white oats/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum). This is a split-plot, randomized, complete block design with three replications. SMS were assigned {{in the main}} plot and CRS systems in the split-plots. This work addressed only data on crop rotation systems. There {{were no significant differences}} between the CRS for number of grains per plant, 1, 000 grain weight and first pod height in soybean. The crop rotation for a summer, with corn or sorghum, propitiates a higher soybean yield compared with the other systems and monoculture soybean. The combination of conservation systems (no tillage and minimum tillage) and CR resulted in a higher soybean yield. The lowest grain yield and grain weight per plant were obtained in monoculture soybean...|$|R
