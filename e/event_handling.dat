25|$|During the {{development}} cycle for QuickTime 3.0, {{part of the}} engineering team {{was working on a}} more advanced version of QuickTime to be known as QuickTime interactive or QTi. Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious. It allowed any QuickTime movie to be a fully interactive and programmable container for media. A special track type was added that contained an interpreter for a custom programming language based on 68000 assembly language. This supported a comprehensive user interaction model for mouse and keyboard <b>event</b> <b>handling</b> based in part on the AML language from the Apple Media Tool.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Gower {{developed}} RuneScape {{with the}} assistance of his brother Paul Gower. It was originally conceived as a text-based MUD, but graphics were incorporated early in development, adding it to the ranks of what were then known as [...] "graphical MUDs". The first public version of the game used a mixture of three-dimensional and two-dimensional sprites. It was released as a beta version on 4 January 2001, and originally operated out of their parents' house in Nottingham. In December 2001, the Gower brothers, along with Constant Tedder, formed Jagex to take over the business aspects of running RuneScape. Among its early innovations Jagex developed an interpreted domain-specific scripting language called RuneScript, which is used by RuneScape's server for <b>event</b> <b>handling.</b> In February 2002, a monthly membership service was introduced, allowing access to additional features including new areas, quests, and items not available to free users.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a compilation scheme, called ASP 2 AR, for translating ASP into event-driven action rules. For an ASP program, the generated program maintains a partial answer set {{as a pair}} of sets of tuples (called IN and OUT) and propagates updates to these sets using action rules. To facilitate propagation, we encode each set as a finite-domain variable and treat additions of tuples into a set as <b>events</b> <b>handled</b> by action rules. Like GASP and ASPeRiX, ASP 2 AR requires no prior grounding of programs. The preliminary experimental results show that ASP 2 AR is an order of magnitude faster than GASP and is much faster than Clasp on benchmarks that require heavy grounding. No Full Tex...|$|R

Overlapped I/O is particularly useful for sockets and pipes. It is not well supported in Windows 9x.|$|R
