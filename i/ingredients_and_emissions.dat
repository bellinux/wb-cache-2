40|$|Historically, {{cigarettes}} and other tobacco products have been exempt from {{health and safety}} standards for <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> <b>emissions</b> that are typically applied to other consumed products including foods, beverages and drugs (1, 2, 3). Although some countries have begun to develop and apply standards for allowable ingredients, there are no globally accepted standards or guidelines (2). Presently limits on emissions from tobacco products have not been implemented {{with the exception of}} estimates of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (2). An important consideration in the regulation of ingredients is that when the cigarette is used as intended, the ingredients can be modified and emission profiles altered during the processes of combustion (“burning”) and pyrolysis (“modification by heat”). Therefore, the focus of this document is on the importance of evaluating tobacco product emissions as well as their ingredients under the conditions in which these products are actually used. The purpose of the document is to provide recommendations to support the development of protocols for assessing tobacco product ingredients and associated emissions with the intent to reduce tobacco caused disease. The central premise is that tobacco product <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> <b>emissions</b> thereof, includin...|$|E
40|$|In November 2003, the WHO Director-General formalized the Scientific Advisory Committee on Tobacco Product Regulation (SACTob) by {{changing}} its status {{to that of}} a study group. Following the status change, the SACTob became the "WHO Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation" (TobReg). It is composed of national and international scientific experts on product regulation, tobacco dependence treatment, and laboratory analysis of tobacco <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> <b>emissions.</b> Its work is based on cutting edge research on tobacco product issues. It conducts research in order to fill regulatory gaps in tobacco control. As a formalized entity of WHO, TobReg reports to the Executive Board through the Director-General in order to draw the Member States' attention to WHO's efforts in tobacco product regulation. This recommendation was approved and adopted by TobReg during its first meeting on 26 to 28 October 2004 in Montebello, Canada...|$|E
40|$|Objective This Agent paper (II of V on {{monitoring}} the tobacco use epidemic) summarizes the findings and {{recommendations of the}} Agent (product) Working Group of the November, 2002, National Tobacco Monitoring, Research and Evaluation Workshop. Methods The Agent Working Group evaluated {{the need to develop}} new surveillance systems for quantifying <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> <b>emissions</b> of tobacco and tobacco smoke and to improve methods to assess uptake and metabolism of these constituents taking into account variability in human smoking behavior. Results The toxic properties of numerous tobacco and tobacco smoke constituents are well known, yet systematic monitoring of tobacco products has historically been limited to tar, nicotine, and CO in mainstream cigarette smoke using a machine-smoking protocol that does not reflect human smoking behavior. Toxicity of smokeless tobacco products has not been regularly monitored. Tobacco products are constantly changing and untested products are introduced into the marketplace with great frequency, including potential reduced-exposure products (PREPs). The public health impact of new or modified tobacco products is unknown. Conclusions Systematic surveillance is recommended for mainstream smoke constituents such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA), total and free-base nicotine, volatile organic compounds, aromatic amines, and metals; and design attributes including tobacco blend, additives, and filter ventilation. Research on smoking topography is recommended to help define machine-smoking protocols for monitoring emissions reflective of human smoking behavior. Recommendations are made for marketplace product sampling and for population monitoring of smoking topography, emissions of toxic constituents, biomarkers of exposure and, eventually, risk of tobacco-related diseases.

40|$|A novel {{luminescent}} {{temperature sensor}} using ruthenium(II) -tris(2, 2 ´-bipyridil) ([Ru(bpy) ₃]²⁺) incorporated into chitosan polymer matrix was developed. The sensor exhibits completely reversible and stable luminescent response (λ exc = 455 nm, λ em = 605 nm), strong temperature sensitivity (– 2. 0 %/°C), significant luminescence intensity decrease (~ 10 ×) {{in the range}} of 25 – 75 °C, and stable construction. Ruthenium(II) complex oxygen sensitivity was avoided by use of matrix (chitosan) with low oxygen permeability coefficient. In the absence of oxygen the sensor shows a little higher accuracy and stability of luminescence response than under oxygen conditions. Moreover, this sensor, due to biocompatibility of the used <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> the <b>emission</b> in the red VIS-region, which is transparent for tissues, is promising for use in biological applications...|$|R
40|$|The swine {{wastewater}} has {{the characteristics}} of high concentration of organic matter, suspended solids and more high ammonia nitrogen, odor, complex pollution <b>ingredient</b> <b>and</b> large <b>emissions.</b> Microbial fuel cells (MFC) is an electrochemical and biological systems related to chemical energy into electrical energy. A two-chambered cubic microbial fuel cell {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of a novel 3 D electrode which made of iron and copper on the electricity generation. The swine wastewater containing total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) 3300 ± 300 mg/L was used as the feedstock in anode chamber, and the potassium ferricyanide was used as electron acceptor in cathode chamber. The MFC reactor was incubated with the initial pH 7. 0 in a air-shaker with a temperature (ca. 35 °C) and 100 rpm in fed-batch mode. A fixed external resistance (R) of 100 Ω was connected between the electrodes and the closed circuit potentials of the MFCs were recorded every 2 min. The results show that using iron 3 D electrode has the peak electricity generation of 176 mV at the first two day and maintained the stable electricity voltage of 110 mV during the 5 th to 15 th days. The COD removal efficiency could reach 80 %. Using copper 3 D electrode only can generate the peak electricity of 33. 1 mV and stable electricity of 27 mV with the COD removal efficiency of 70 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{internal}} dust extinction in spiral galaxies {{can affect}} {{our understanding of}} their structure and morphology, {{as well as our}} perception of the distant universe in the background. The intrinsic properties of the stellar and dust components can be studied by comparing the observed appearance of a dusty spiral in the optical with a radiative transfer model. The absorbed starlight is re-radiated by dust in the FIR/sub-mm. Thus, observations at long wavelengths allow to put further constraints on the properties of the dust distribution. I present our Monte Carlo simulations for dust extinction <b>and</b> <b>emission</b> in galactic disks, discuss the basic <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> limitations and compare them with other solutions for the radiative transfer available in the literature. I review the current picture of dusty disks that emerges from radiative transfer studies. 1...|$|R
