Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E

25|$|Water has a {{high heat}} of {{vaporization}} and is relatively inert, {{which makes it a}} good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.|$|E
25|$|Corner stoppage: a fighter's corner men may {{announce}} defeat on the fighter's behalf {{by throwing}} {{in the towel}} during the match in progress or between rounds. This is normally done when a fighter is being beaten {{to the point where}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> and unnecessary to continue. In some cases, the fighter may be injured.|$|E
25|$|Ozone is {{colourless}} {{or slightly}} bluish gas (blue when liquefied), slightly {{soluble in water}} and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or fluorocarbons, where it forms a blue solution. At , it condenses to form a dark blue liquid. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below , it forms a violet-black solid.|$|E

25|$|In Arab folklore, sacred {{trees are}} haunted by jinn; sacrifices are made, and the sick who sleep beneath them receive {{prescriptions}} in their dreams. Here, as frequently elsewhere, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{to pull a}} bough. This dread of damaging special trees is familiar: Cato instructed the woodman to sacrifice to the male or female deity before thinning a grove, while in the Homeric poem to Aphrodite the tree nymph is wounded when the tree is injured, and dies when the trunk falls.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} one's body an {{individual}} has conjunction with heaven through the angels, and with each person, {{there are at least}} two evil spirits and two angels. Temptation or pains of conscience originates from a conflict between evil spirits and angels. Due to man's sinful nature <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to have open direct communication with angels and can only be seen when one's spiritual sight has been opened. Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to what is good tacitly using the person's own thoughts.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{common ragwort}} (Senecio jacobaea) {{is one of}} the five plants named as an {{injurious}} weed under the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959. The word injurious in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to animals, as all the other injurious weeds listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this Act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs {{to prevent the spread of}} the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the Act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.|$|E

25|$|The {{hot wire}} method for the {{production}} of KrF2 uses krypton in a solid state with a hot wire running a few centimeters away from it as fluorine gas is then run past the wire. The wire has a large current, causing it to reach temperatures around 680°C. This causes the fluorine gas to split into its radicals, which then can react with the solid krypton. Under ideal conditions, it has been known to reach a maximum yield of 6g/h. In order to achieve optimal yields the gap between the wire and the solid krypton should be 1cm, giving rise to a temperature gradient of about 900°C/cm. A major downside to this method is the amount of electricity that has to be passed through the wire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> if not properly set up.|$|E
25|$|David Stern is a {{computer}} geek who takes {{a job with the}} Dordogne River Valley archeological site just to be close to where his girlfriend is going to school. When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern {{to be part of the}} team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands it better than anyone else. Stern is also the only one who recognizes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival in his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team. Stern saves their lives.|$|E
25|$|Early Buddhism {{held that}} trees had neither mind nor feeling and might {{lawfully}} be cut; but it recognized that certain spirits might reside in them, such as Nang Takian in Thailand. Propitiation is {{made before the}} axe is laid to the holy trees; loss of life or of wealth {{and the failure of}} rain are feared should they be wantonly cut; there are even trees which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to climb. The Talein of Burma prays to the tree before he cuts it down, and the African woodman will place a fresh sprig upon the tree. Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or Kadambariyamman, associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.|$|E

25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern dories {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional dories and {{compensate for the}} lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous,</b> and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled against}} Mr. Sentell and {{established}} the precedent in U.S. jurisprudence that {{the regulation of}} dogs was within the police power of the state, and that the dogs were not as valuable as horses, cattle, sheep, or other domesticated animals:It is true that under the Fourteenth Amendment, no state can deprive a person of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law, but in determining what is due process of law, we are bound to consider {{the nature of the}} property, the necessity for its sacrifice, {{and the extent to which}} it has heretofore been regarded as within the police power. So far as property is inoffensive or harmless, it can only be condemned or destroyed by legal proceedings, with due notice to the owner; but, so far as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> to the safety or health of the community, due process of law may authorize its summary destruction....|$|E

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship {{is the role of the}} tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the idea that people with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices {{remotely}} operated {{from a distance}} by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dangerous,</b> far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They {{can also be used}} to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely. Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets. Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's Packbot and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|E
