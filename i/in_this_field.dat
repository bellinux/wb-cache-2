5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>field</b> have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>field.</b> Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>field,</b> nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>field</b> are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E

5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>field</b> may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1890s, Janáček led the {{mainstream}} of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia, using a repertoire of folksongs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements. Most of his achievements <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>field</b> were published in 1899–1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong. His compositional work was still influenced by the declamatory, dramatic style of Smetana and Dvořák. He expressed very negative opinions on German neo-classicism and especially on Wagner in the Hudební listy journal, which he founded in 1884. The death of his second child, Vladimír, in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera, Beginning of the Romance (1891) and the cantata Amarus (1897).|$|E

Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} {{with the use of}} the microscope and the development of a silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s.

He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw.
