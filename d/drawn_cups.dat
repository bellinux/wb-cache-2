However, the size {{effects in the}} micro hydro deep drawing become considerable and significantly influence shape accuracy of <b>drawn</b> <b>cups.</b> In this study, a Voronoi micro scale simulation model was developed to consider the size effects of SUS 304 foils. A surface layer model was additionally applied in the simulation to further explain the size effects. The micro hydro deep drawing experiments were conducted with annealed SUS 304 foils and the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups</b> were examined. The wrinkling phenomenon was generally aggravated with the hydraulic pressure. Simulation results also show that the high hydraulic pressure does not improve the shape accuracy of the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups</b> as that in the normal scale hydro deep dawning process does.

As a comparison, TiC-coated WC-Co, non-coated WC-Co and tool steel dies were used. The effects of the viscosity of a lubricant and the ironing speed on the formability for the cermet die were examined. The cermet die exhibited the largest seizure resistance.

Three kinds of blank shape, square, octagon, and tricontadigon are used to change the galling position on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup.</b> FEM simulation shows that galling on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> occurs at the top of the boundary between the drawn area and the bent area for the square blank and at the top of the middle of the drawn zone for the octagon or tricontadigon blank. Demonstration experiments using a high-tensile-strength steel sheet under a lubricated condition show that the galling on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> does occur as predicted by FEM simulation. Galling on the die surface is left at the path end of the galling position of the blank material. It is also found that the sliding distance after the galling position of the blank reaches the maximum temperature gives a great effect on the galling generation: the longer the sliding distance is, the easier the galling generation becomes...|$|R

Contact and friction significantly affect micro-sheet forming and cannot be simplified as homogeneous in simulation. Material heterogeneity of the blank further affects the friction and its impact becomes significant in micro-scale. In this study, a FE model representing surface morphology of SUS 304 sheets was built for micro deep drawing simulation. Each node on the blank model had the same height as an asperity. Key surface morphological characters of the blank can be presented with a proper mesh density. The material size effects were presented via refined material properties assignment based on sheets¿ microstructures. Due to the initial surface morphology, wear accumulation and thickness distribution were significantly affected. Experimental results well validated prediction of worst worn area on <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> mouth in simulation.

Sheets were cold- rolled to final thicknesses of 1. 5 and 3 mm (65 pct reduction), having martensite fraction of 70 - 95 %. Sheets were heated locally by {{a laser beam}} to various peak temperatures to obtain different degrees of martensite reversion to austenite. Mechanical properties and formability of grain-refined and coarse-grained structures were measured by tensile, bending and Erichsen cup tests. In addition to standard Erichsen cup test, additional interrupted tests were carried out, where cups were first stretched close to the critical strain. <b>Drawn</b> <b>cups</b> were then heated locally by a laser beam to revitalize the structure and thereby enhance the formability in the following cupping test until failure. Various structures were produced: completely reverted microstructures (T > 700 °C) with grain sizes 0. 9 - 2 μm in addition to partially reverted structure (T < 700 °C) containing nano- and ultrafine-grained austenite (0. 6 μm) with some martensite. Results showed that local laser heat treatment is suitable for the reversion treatment to refine the austenite grain size. Refinement of the austenitic structures increased strength properties and the formability was better than with coarse grained structures having the same strength. Especially the yield strength was significantly enhanced, being around 900 MPa in the strongest reverted structure compared to the 300 - 400 MPa of the coarse grained austenitic structure. It was demonstrated that the local laser treatment restored formability of the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups,</b> allowing stretching to be continued...|$|E

The aim {{of this process is}} to form deep <b>drawn</b> <b>cups</b> without any kind of forming instability such as buckling, wrinkling or bursting (tearing). The most important parameters in achieving this goal are fluid pressure and blank holder force. So in this study, a fuzzy logic control algorithm was used with Ls-Dyna FEA subroutines to determine the optimum fluid pressure (P) and the blank holder force (BHF) since it requires {{a lot of time and}} cost to perform this work with trial and error experiments. Minimum element thickness, punch wall contact position and wrinkling height were used as input parameters in the control algorithm.

Compared to the as-received sheet with a strong basal texture, the RUB processed sheet with a weaker basal texture can be successfully drawn at a larger limiting drawing ratio (LDR) of 1. 7. For both the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups,</b> the c-axis of some grains tends to rotate toward the transverse direction (TD) of the sheet in the inner regions of the shoulders due to the occurrence of extension twinning and the basal texture dramatically changes to the c-axis//TD texture in {{the walls and the}} edges. Compared with the drawn cup of the as-received sheet, the drawn cup of the RUB processed sheet maintains a weaker texture intensity in the shoulder, which results in a larger Schmid factor of basal slip and thus contributes to the sheet thinning. Further, for the drawn cup of the RUB processed sheet, a finer grain microstructure resulting from the twin dynamic recrystallization (TDRX) is observed in the edge. The TDRX {{plays an important role in}} the softening during plastic deformation and consequently favours the further deformation.
