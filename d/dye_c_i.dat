The diffusion coefficient of <b>dye</b> <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b>  Acid Red  423 calculated according to Weisz model is higher when dyeing conventional leather. The change of deliming method has influence on chromed leather dyeing but this influence is not significant. The adsorption ability of control leather fibres at 30 ºC and 45 ºC is higher using both dyes as compared to the dyeing the experimental one. The increase of dyeing temperature increases the adsorption ability independently on the sort of leather fibres. Such dependence of the adsorption ability on the temperature shows that hydrophobic action and van der Waals forces prevail between dye and fibres during dyeing process. The Gibbs energy changes show that adsorption of both dyes by leather fibres independently on their sort is a spontaneous process. The affinity of both dyes to conventional leather fibres is higher comparing with experimental one. The change of enthalpy is positive in all cases, and it means that the driving force of the dyeing is the change of entropy. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E

The three-dimensional electrode system generated more hydroxyl radicals than a two-dimensional system due {{to the formation of}} microelectrodes under applied high potential. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A simulated wastewater containing the monoazo <b>dye</b> <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Acid Orange 7 was electrolytically treated using a three-dimensional electrode reactor equipped with granular activated carbon as particle electrode. The activated carbon fiber cathode was more effective than either a graphite or a stainless steel cathode due to its larger surface area which was beneficial to the electrogeneration of H(2) O(2). Under the reaction conditions of 20 V and 3. 0 g L(- 1) Na(2) SO(4) at pH 3. 0, decrease in the COD of up to 80 %, and in the TOC by up to 72 % were achieved and almost the complete decolorization of the dye was secured after 180 min electrolysis. Furthermore, decay of the dye followed a pseudo-first-order reaction in the first 60 min treatment.

30|$|Nickel {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized {{and used}} to decolourize <b>dye</b> effluent. <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Reactive Blue 21 was taken as a reference dye, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) {{was used as a}} stabilizer to prevent agglomeration of nanoparticles. Characterization of nanoparticles was done by a laser light scattering particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Various parameters like pH, dye concentration, nanoparticle concentration, alkali addition, salt addition and duration studied for dye decolourization. To confirm the attachment of degraded products of dye on the nanoparticles, FT-IR analysis was done. About 98  % colour removal with simultaneous reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was achieved.|$|R
40|$|Iron-deposited {{graphite}} surfaces were prepared, characterized {{and employed}} as cathode materials for electrochemical vat-dyeing process containing very low concentration of sodium dithionite. The electrodeposition, in presence of ammonium thiocyanate and gelatin or animal glue as binding additives, {{were found to}} give finer iron deposits for improved electrochemical dyeing application. The electrodepositswere characterized using scanning electron microscopy, electron-dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction methods, before and after electrochemical dyeing process. The electrochemical activity of the iron-deposited graphite electrodes always stored in water seems {{to depend on the}} surface-bound Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + redox species. Vat <b>dyes</b> like <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Vat Violet 1, <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Vat Green 1 and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Vat Blue 4 could be efficiently dyed employing these above electrode materials. The colour intensity and washing fastness of the dyed fabrics were found to be equal with conventionally dyed fabrics. The electrodes could also be reused for the dyeing process...|$|R
40|$|To improve surface {{wettability}} and dye-ability of Nylon microfiber artificial leather, {{we apply}} oxygen plasma treatment and subsequently graft-polymerize acrylamide (AAm) on the surface. The surface properties of AAm-grafted Nylon microfiber artificial leather {{are characterized by}} FT-IR, SEM, ESCA and <b>dyeing</b> density (<b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> reactive Blue 4). The dyeing rate of AAm-grafted Nylon microfiber artificial leather, up-regulated with higher acrylamide grafting concentration, increases to 67. 1 mg/cm 2, and remains 66. 4 mg/cm 2 after rinsed by water, showed better stability than that of control and oxygen plasma modified Nylon microfiber artificial leather. The water-absorptivity of s-graft acrylamide is five times than that of control. From the results, the efficiency and density of dyeing are both improved, indicating that plasma graft polymerization process could contribute to promote the absorption of dye on the artificial leather...|$|R
