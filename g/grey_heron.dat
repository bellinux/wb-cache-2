5|$|The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, {{southeast}} of the town centre {{and close to the}} Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, shoveller, pochard, tufted duck, <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> and mute swans.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} <b>grey</b> <b>heron,</b> European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
50|$|A study {{performed}} by Sitko and Heneberg in the Czech Republic between 1962 and 2013 suggested that central European <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> host 29 species of parasitic worms. The dominant species consisted of Apharyngostrigea cornu (67% prevalence), Posthodiplostomum cuticola (41% prevalence), Echinochasmus beleocephalus (39% prevalence), Uroproctepisthmium bursicola (36% prevalence), Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus (31% prevalence), Desmidocercella numidica (29% prevalence) and Bilharziella polonica (5% prevalence). Juvenile <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> {{were shown to}} host fewer species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult herons. Of the digenean flatworms found in central European <b>grey</b> <b>herons,</b> 52% of the species likely infected their definitive hosts outside central Europe itself, in the pre-migratory, migratory, or wintering quarters, {{despite the fact that}} a substantial proportion of <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> do not migrate to the south.|$|R

5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, marbled white, small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E
25|$|Of {{interest}} to nature watchers are the large great cormorant (2000 pairs) and <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> (500 pairs) colonies west of Juodkrantė.|$|E
40|$|To examine factors {{affecting}} feeding efficiency of <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> (Ardea cinerea), the foraging behavior was studied at areservoir in Asan city, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea during the breeding seasons (from April to July) of 2006 and 2007. Four factors (age of foraging birds, time of day, breeding stage, and microhabitat type) were analyzed. Adults weremore efficient foragers than recently fledged juveniles, {{and they had}} a higher success rate than juveniles. About half ofthe adults caught large prey, whereas most juveniles caught only small prey. Adult <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> had different feeding efficiencyaccording to the breeding stage. Pecking and capture rates were high during the late period (fledging stage), andbiomass intake rates were high during the early (incubating stage) and late periods. However, time of day had no significanteffect on foraging activity of adult <b>grey</b> <b>herons.</b> Feeding activities of adult <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> also showed significant variationamong microhabitat types. Pecking and capture rates were higher in the submerged plants area, but capture successrate and biomass intake rate were not different according to microhabitat type...|$|R

25|$|South-eastern Wexford is an {{important}} site for wild birds—the north side of Wexford Harbour, the North Slob, is home to 10,000 Greenland white-fronted geese each winter (roughly {{one third of the}} entire world's population), while in the summer Lady's Island Lake is {{an important}} breeding site for terns, especially the roseate tern. The <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> is also seen.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} bird {{spend a lot}} of time in the reserve because they can feed on fish there. <b>Grey</b> <b>herons</b> and kingfishers are often seen on the reserve.|$|R
5|$|A {{population}} of feral Mandarin ducks {{have been present}} on the river since 1978. Kingfishers and <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> can also be seen. Otters are common {{near the mouth of}} the river.|$|R

25|$|Kaggaladu Heronry: This {{is located}} in Tumkur {{district}} {{and is one of}} the largest painted stork sanctuaries in South India. Some of the birds that nest here are painted storks, <b>grey</b> <b>herons,</b> pelicans, black stilts and ducks.|$|R
50|$|Breeding birds include {{important}} {{numbers of}} waders such as lapwing and redshank. Little egrets have recently joined <b>grey</b> <b>herons</b> in the heronry. The woodlands hold redstart, wood warbler and pied flycatcher while red kites frequently pass overhead.|$|R
25|$|The {{island is}} one of the few places in {{southern}} England where indigenous red squirrels survive, largely because non-native grey squirrels have never been introduced to the island. The Brownsea red squirrel population is the only population known in the UK to carry the human form of the bacteria stem Mycobacterium leprae that causes leprosy in humans. Brownsea also has a small ornamental population of peacocks. The island has a heronry, in which both <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> and little egret nest.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a wealth}} of birdlife, 583 species in total, of which 258 breed on the island or remain during winter. Because of its mild winters for its latitude, Great Britain hosts {{important}} numbers of many wintering species, particularly ducks, geese and swans. Other well known bird species include the golden eagle, <b>grey</b> <b>heron,</b> kingfisher, pigeon, sparrow, pheasant, partridge, and various species of crow, finch, gull, auk, grouse, owl and falcon. There are six species of reptile on the island; three snakes and three lizards including the legless slowworm. One snake, the adder, is venomous but rarely deadly. Amphibians present are frogs, toads and newts.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that the herons have nested near Juodkrantė since 17th century, but the cormorants arrived only {{at the beginning of}} 19th century. The cormorants were exterminated {{at the end of the}} 19th century due to Prussian administration regulations and started to reappear only in the 1970s. The large cormorant colony has damaged the old and fragile forest because the birds' excrement burns tree roots. During last 15 years about 10 ha (25 acres) of forest has died. Fishermen blame the birds for diminishing fish catches, but unlike in Prussia, the regulations now do not allow killing them as both <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> and great cormorant are protected species in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna: The birds {{recorded}} are: purple moorhen {{also known}} as purple swamphen, pheasant-tailed jacana, cormorants, brahminy kite, darter, kingfishers, weaver birds, purple <b>heron,</b> <b>grey</b> <b>herons,</b> Indian pond herons, little grebes, coots and teals can be found here.|$|R
50|$|Located {{just inside}} the village {{boundary}} is Beal Carrs, a watered area formed in 1999 {{as a result of}} extensive flooding. Popular with birdwatchers, the Carrs are visited by Kestrels, <b>Grey</b> <b>Herons</b> and other birds and wildfowl.|$|R

25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (<b>grey</b> <b>heron,</b> black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} reaches {{breeding}} maturity {{within a year}} from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are not in holes as such, but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah {{can serve as a}} nest site. [...] This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork, white-tailed eagle, osprey, black kite or <b>grey</b> <b>heron.</b> It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces, such as the barn swallow, house martin, sand martin or European bee-eater.|$|E
500|$|The {{canal and}} its environs are {{important}} for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including <b>grey</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cinerea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole (Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis) habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new [...] "vole-friendly" [...] techniques of bank protection have been developed.|$|E
25|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} water birds {{winter in the}} delta, including the world’s largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns. Other birds making {{their homes in the}} delta include <b>grey</b> <b>herons,</b> Kentish plovers, shovelers, cormorants, egrets and ibises.|$|R
25|$|Frederiksberg Gardens is an English-style Romantic {{landscape}} {{garden with}} winding paths, canals, lakes, small islands and magnificent trees.
