5|$|Halo: First Strike {{opens with}} the arrival of the Covenant armada at the human stronghold planet of Reach. The book follows both the {{unsuccessful}} attempt to defend Reach by the SPARTAN-IIs who were on the planet's surface and the adventures of the rag-tag survivors of the battle at Alpha Halo. The book also reveals that humanity's worst fear is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> true: the Covenant is on its way to Earth. The book was well received by critics and sold well, making The New York Times Best Seller list. Critics found it added depth to the Halo video games and that it was exciting throughout.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{when the}} Wii U console was first {{shown at the}} E3 2011 in Los Angeles, Namco {{announced}} that they would develop a Tekken game for the Wii U, which was untitled at the time. However, at E3 2012, {{it was announced that}} Tekken Tag Tournament 2 would come to the Wii U, which was already <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition is amongst the first third-party Wii U games that is available in both retail and as a downloadable format for the Nintendo eShop. In Japan, the downloadable version is available for a slightly lower price than the retail format.|$|E
5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty {{as a condition of}} his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E

25|$|In July 1954, the AERE was reorganised {{into the}} United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 {{in order to}} house the machine began that year. Despite its {{advanced}} design, the price tag was modest: about US$1million. By late 1956 {{it was clear that}} ZETA was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> online in mid-1957, beating the Model C stellarator and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 1962, Geiger crashed {{directly}} into the center field wall at Fenway Park attempting to catch a Tito Francona drive as the Red Sox lost to his old team Cleveland in 13 innings. He ventured back on the dirt track and {{looked as if he}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the ball. He made a sudden leap for it but struck the wall, and the ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly to his knees and fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even {{if we do not}} know exactly what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E

25|$|ARPA {{was asked}} to {{consider}} the problem of using the technology in a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, {{and they had to}} fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, that meant the Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they could watch the incoming warheads, see if any were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E
25|$|Poirot instructs {{her to tell}} Andersen {{that she}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into a large sum of money that she will leave to the Flock, that she has {{problems}} with her lungs, and that Mrs Clegg will soon inherit a large sum from an aunt, more than her present estate. Poirot also asks if she has met a Mr Cole at the sanctuary. Miss Carnaby has and to her {{he is a very}} strange man. As if to prove her assertion correct, soon afterwards Mr Cole accosts Miss Carnaby with tales of his strange visions which involve sacrifices, Jehovah, and even Odin. She is saved from further strange tales by the arrival of Mr Lipscombe, the lodge-keeper of the Devonshire estate.|$|E
25|$|The {{countryside}} is beautiful, but {{the weather}} is cold and often inclement, the cottage is without running water or light, they have no food and the locals are unwelcoming – in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends. They see Jake prowling around their cottage. Marwood suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed {{in the interest of}} safety, but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> after them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded with a punctured tyre.|$|E

25|$|On October 26, 2006, Skybus {{announced}} {{a deal with}} the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to buy 65 of its Airbus A319 aircraft. The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E
25|$|A very frail Ethel {{returns to}} Albert Square in 2000, {{arriving}} unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel {{had run away}} from her retirement village and had decided that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the square, {{to live in the}} place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E
