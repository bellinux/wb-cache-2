[...] This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. [...] Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves lock (lock time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. [...] Depending on the application, this may require {{one or more of}} the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (low pass filter) and/or derivative (<b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter).</b> [...] Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop's gain margin and phase margin.

40|$|To enhance susceptibility-related {{contrast}} of magnetic resonance images, {{the phase of}} susceptibility weighted data needs to be corrected for background inhomogeneities and phase wraps caused by them. Current methods either use homodyne filtering {{or a combination of}} phase unwrapping and <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering.</b> The drawback of homodyne filtering is incomplete elimination of phase wraps in areas with steep phase topography produced by background inhomogeneities of the static magnetic field. The disadvantage of phase unwrapping is that it requires subsequent <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering,</b> which introduces artifacts in areas with very steep transitions, such as areas near interfaces between parenchyma and bone or air.

Of the 115 patients, 51 (44 %) had an abnormal signal-averaged ECG (one or more abnormal signal-averaged variables), 51 (44 %) at 25 Hz and 48 (42 %) at 40 Hz <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering.</b> A <b>higher</b> proportion of patients with an inferior wall infarction had an abnormal signal-averaged ECG as compared with patients with anterior wall infarction (58 % versus 31 %). Over a 14 ± 8 month follow-up period 16 patients (14 %) had an arrhythmic event. An abnormal signal-averaged ECG at 40 Hz <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering</b> had a <b>higher</b> sensitivity (81 % versus 75 %) and specificity (65 % versus 61 %) than at 25 Hz <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering.</b> The predictive value of the signal-averaged ECG was superior to that of the ejection fraction (40 % versus 20 %) in anterior wall myocardial infarction, whereas in patients with inferior wall infarction, the predictive values of the two tests were equivalent. The prognostic power of 27 clinical and noninvasive variables was determined with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The variables most significantly associated with an arrhythmic event were 1) signal-averaged QRS duration at 40 Hz (improvement χ 2 = 16. 58 = 0. 0001); 2) couplets (improvement χ 2 = 5. 39 p = 0. 02); and 3) ejection fraction (improvement χ 2 = 4. 10, p = 0. 04). In conclusion: 1) An abnormal signal-averaged ECG is seen in a high proportion of patients after an acute myocardial infarction and is associated with a significantly higher incidence of arrhythmic events. 2) <b>High</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering</b> provided a better sensitivity and specificity at 40 Hz than at 25 Hz. 3) The predictive value of the signal-averaged ECG in patients with anterior wall infarction is better than that of the ejection fraction, whereas the predictive value of these two tests is equivalent in inferior infarction. 4) The duration of the signal-averaged QRS complex is the most significant independent predictor of an arrhythmic event, followed by ventricular couplets and ejection fraction...|$|R

This paper presents a novel hybrid method for enhancing digital X-Ray radiograph images by seeking optimal spatial and frequency domain image enhancement combinations. The selected methods from the spatial domain include: negative transform, histogram equalization and power-law transform. Selected enhancement methods from the frequency domain include: gaussian low and <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> and butterworth low and <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters.</b> Over 80 possible combinations have been tested, {{where some of the}} combinations have yielded in an optimal enhancement compared to the original image, according to radiologist subjective assessments. Medically, the proposed methods have clarified the vascular impression in hilar regions in regular X-ray images. This can help radiologists in diagnosing vascular pathology, such as pulmonary embolism in case of thrombus that has been logged in pulmonary trunk, which will appear as a filling defect.

In this experiment we evaluated the hearing thresholds of three different signals (wide-band, low <b>pass</b> <b>filtered,</b> and <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> noises) in presence of a high level low frequency masker (90 dB SPL, 220 Hz), and we decreased the transmission of both masker and signal by changing the middle ear stiffness in 42 normal subjects {{to determine whether or not}} their thresholds will change by the same amounts which leads to linear function or their thresholds will change by different amounts which will be related to nonlinear function of masking at high levels.
