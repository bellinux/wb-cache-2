40|$|Abstract − The aim of {{this study}} is the {{development}} of a novel nonintrusive mass flowmeter for the moved bed gravity flow of the new process, i. e. : the synthetic naphtha and hydrogen making reactor and DRI (Direct Reduction for Iron Ore) reducing petroleum and coke coal. One of the authors already developed cross correlation method, steady state heat transfer method and PZT acoustic emission method. This paper describes a prototype of a new cross correlation method using a pulse <b>heating</b> <b>marking</b> signal (JPA 1999 - 23339). The steady state heat transfer type is improved ale to +- 0. 8 % full scale in this paper and it is the most available for the new process till the third oil crisis or reconstruction of coke. This new prototype should be more useful for the derivative temperature against choking the feed powder {{on the surface of the}} temperature sensors. ...|$|R

50|$|Much {{like the}} Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2014 off-season, the Heat {{focused on how}} it would {{maintain}} and remain a top-contender without LeBron James. However, rather than firing key members and rebuilding, the Heat kept much of its roster together and re-tooled. Despite the departure of James, the off-season for the <b>Heat</b> <b>marked</b> the return of many key veterans {{and the arrival of}} new stars embarking on a hopeful note for the Heat. Chris Bosh signed to a hefty $115,000,000 contract for five years. Dwyane Wade also re-signed for a two-year contract. Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem and Chris Andersen also returned however James Jones went to go join LeBron in Cleveland. The Heat also signed free-agents Luol Deng from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Danny Granger from the Los Angeles Clippers and Josh McRoberts from the then Charlotte Bobcats. The Heat also acquired 2014 draftee Shabazz Napier. Because of the Heat's off-season handling of James's departure, while not necessarily a title-favorite, the Heat still remained by many sports analysts to remain a top contender in the east.|$|R
50|$|On November 6, 2015, Korver scored 22 points, hitting {{all eight}} of his shots, {{including}} four from three-point range, as the Hawks won their sixth straight with a 121-115 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Pelicans. On December 26, in a win over the New York Knicks, Korver hit one three-pointer and passed Rashard Lewis for ninth place on the all-time list for three-pointers made. However, his late December shooting slump marked {{one of the worst}} shooting stretches of his career. In four games between December 23-29, Korver shot 5-of-33 from the field and a woeful 2-of-27 from three-point range. Korver continued to struggle with his shot in January, missing all six of his shots on January 31 against the Miami <b>Heat,</b> <b>marking</b> just the third time in his career that he went 0-of-6 or worse as a starter. Over 47 games to begin the season, his 42% field goal shooting was the worst it had been since the 2004-05 season, and his 37% three-point shooting was a career-low success rate.|$|R

40|$|Zur Differenzierung von Kurzzeitkontaktstrommarken zu klassischen Strommarken bezueglich der Auspraegung von Morphologie, Histologie und Metallisationsmuster werden mittels Licht- und Rasterelektronenmikroskopie sowie mikroanalytischer Verfahren Einflussfaktoren eruiert. Die Stromflussdauer hat fuer die Auspraegung von Morphologie, Histologie und {{diffuser}} Metallisation einen entscheidenden, fuer die Ablagerung von metallischen Partikeln und Kugeln einen untergeordneten Einfluss. Die Abgrenzung zwischen Strom- und Hitzemarken, sowie zu Elektroschockresiduen ist durch das Metallisationsmuster eindeutig moeglich. Anhand von Stofffasern kann auf das getragene Kleidungsstueck, mittels der Metallisation auf die verwendete Elektrode geschlossen werden. Die Untersuchung von Morphologie und Metallisationsmuster sollte durch Niedervakuum-REM mit Kuehltisch und EDX erfolgen. For {{differentiation of}} short-time current marks to classical current marks concerning morphology, histology and pattern of metallization factors of influence {{were determined by}} means of light and scanning electron microscopy. The duration of current flow is in respect of morphology, histology and diffuse metallization a deciding factor, regarding to the deposit of metallic particles and pellets a subordinating parameter. The discrimination between current and <b>heat</b> <b>marks</b> {{as well as to}} the residue of electric shock is clearly possible because of the pattern of metallization. By means of fabric fibres a conclusion to the worn garement and by means of metallization an inference to the used electrode is possible. The examination of morphology and pattern of metallization should be carried out by variable-pressure scanning electron microscope with a specimen cooling stage and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy...|$|R

5000|$|In 1941, the 218th Field Artillery {{was ordered}} {{to head to the}} Philippines to guard against {{possible}} Japanese attack. When the Attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, the 218th was at sea, and was immediately rerouted back to Oregon. America had entered World War II, and the 41st Infantry Division was sent to the Pacific War to fight against the Empire of Japan. In the summer of 1943, the 162nd Infantry Regiment alongside a Brigade of Australian troops assaulted Nassau Bay on the north coast of New Guinea in order to drive the Japanese out of Salamaua. The landings were disastrous, and heavy surf swamped may landing craft. [...] The infantry struggled to get ashore, and the invasion was soon called [...] "shipwreck landing." [...] The 218th Field Artillery Battalion was slated to follow the 162nd Infantry in, but not enough boats were available anymore, so B and C Batteries landed several days later. Japanese snipers, booby traps, and jungle ambushes greeted the artillerymen starting the first day, and the constant rain broken by periods of intense steamy <b>heat</b> <b>marked</b> a difficult campaign ahead. The 80 men of C Battery hauled their 4 M116 howitzers through 5 miles of jungle by hand, and were forced to cross and recross rivers in the twisting terrain. Despite the difficulties of moving howitzers through the jungle, the men were dug in on 8 July 1943, six thousand yards from a Japanese controlled hill called, [...] "the Pimple." ...|$|R
