5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and <b>ductwork,</b> and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal <b>ductwork</b> for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks {{do not have}} any platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochère, which protects passengers from inclement weather. The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed <b>ductwork</b> is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a series}} of {{laboratory}} measurements was conducted on residential air handling units (AHUs) and air conditioners to characterize their performance at typical installed conditions. In addition, performance models of blowers and air conditioners were developed from the laboratory measurements and integrated with building energy simulations to predict the energy consumption and the life cycle cost of <b>ductworks</b> with respect to different climates (Chicago, IL and Austin, TX), duct materials (e. g., sheet metal and flex ducts), flow resistances, and blower types (e. g. PSC and ECM blowers). The experimental results showed that PSC and ECM blowers have distinct airflow, power, and efficiency performance in response to increases in the external static pressure (ESP). The building energy simulation results showed that increasing the duct flow resistance from 0. 3 to 0. 9 in. w. g. (75 to 225 Pa) decreased airflow rates of PSC blowers and consequently decreased the annual blower electricity consumptions by 11 % for the Austin home and 16 % for the Chicago home. However, in systems with ECM blowers the same increase in the duct flow resistance increased the annual blower electricity consumptions by about 60 % for both the Austin home and the Chicago home, primarily because ECM blowers maintained constant airflow rates over a range of pressures. For the same increase in the duct flow resistance, the electricity consumptions of condensing units in systems with PSC blowers increased by 2. 7 % for the Austin home and 5. 5 % for the Chicago home, while the electricity increase in systems with ECM blowers were less dramatic, being 1. 6 % for the Austin home and 1. 5 % for the Chicago home. Also, the simulation results indicated that although the cost-effectiveness of a specific duct design is shown to be heavily dependent on initial duct fabrication and installation costs, the use of lower flow resistance <b>ductworks</b> generally leads to lifetime savings {{in the presence of}} supply and return leakages of 10 %. Specifically, the lifetime savings is achieved in 6 out of 8 simulated cases for the Chicago home and all of the simulated cases for the Austin home by using <b>ductworks</b> at lower flow resistances...|$|R

Recently, in Korea, apartment house suppliers are {{required by law to}} establish ventilation systems in apartment houses. In this study, improvement of IAQ by establishing mechanical ventilation system in apartment houses was investigated through mock-up tests. Seven apartment houses were arranged for the test and concentrations of VOCs and Formaldehyde were examined under various conditions of ventilation rates and duct works. The results of this study show that IAQ of the test houses with mechanical ventilation system was improved from about 30 % to 40 % compared with IAQ in the apartment houses without ventilation system. However, there were no apparent concentration differences between the cases of changing ventilation rates and <b>ductworks...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} sizing the network for the {{transport}} of the air, from the Air Handling Unit to terminal units, for a dual duct system, is described. The method of the calculation for the channels presented here leads to a reduction of their size thus reducing cost {{and size of the}} network, with respect to the methodologies usually adopted or proposed. As an alternative to the design criteria traditionally used, we present a method for sizing that requires that the "cold" channel transports air at a temperature value slightly lower (1 - 2 °C) than the minimum inlet temperature (variable with time) required by the zones. The method was applied to some reference networks and the results were compared with those obtained using the design criteria traditionally used. The obtained reductions of the total area of the channels, and therefore as a first approximation of their total weight, range between 15 % and 34 %, also depending, over that on the system, on the temperature of the hot channel, kept constant and ranging between 35 °C and 45 °C. The air speed through the ducts is always lower or equal to the fixed values; this constraint is not always respected in the sizing of the <b>ductworks</b> with the traditional method...|$|R
40|$|Using {{cold air}} {{distribution}} in thermal storage systems {{is one of}} the major areas of energy conservation in HVAC systems. In this paper, blowing of supply air directly through an ice storage system has been investigated. Heat transfer calculations have been performed and by obtaining the leaving air temperature. A comparison between this system and the conventional air handling units using cold water of ice storage, as working fluid, has been considered. In other words, this paper concerns the possibility of blowing supply air directly into a charged ice storage tank, in order to omit water circuit between the storage and the air-handling unit and its coils as well. In this method after ice has been formed in the storage, water is evacuated from the storage and air is blown through the tank. It is found that for the same amount of made ice, due to omitting the water circuit (and coils of air-handling unit), a considerable lower temperature could be achieved. This results in reduced required air flow, size of <b>ductworks,</b> fan energy consumption and generated noise in supply air distribution. It is also shown that escaped air is reduced by decreasing free bypass area inside the storage which leads to increase the efficiency of the method...|$|R
25|$|Lvov, {{concerned}} with inefficiency of existing heating ovens, designed his own heating system and advertised {{it through a}} two-volume treatise on heating and ventilation (Русская Пиростатика / Russkaya Pyrostatica, 1793).

25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with <b>ductwork.</b> Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E
25|$|Tank {{introduced}} a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through <b>ductwork</b> in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E

40|$|The {{values of}} {{microbial}} {{growth in the}} air exiting from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts treated with silver/zeolite {{have been shown to}} be lower than those in the air coming out the traditional metal ones. This study aims to verify how long this antimicrobial activity lasts. All the tests were performed according to US ASTM E 2180 - 01 and ISO-JIZ 22196 standards. Samples of aluminum cladding panels of different thickness and incorporating silver-zeolite were tested in order to verify their thickness depending antibacterial activity. The same kind of linings samples were analyzed after a simulated and accelerated ageing process. Ag-zeolite incorporating HVAC duct panels linings were tested after years from their installation, in order to verify the maintenance of their bactericidal power during time. For laminates containing different amounts of silver+Zeolite it was shown that also in panels with minimum thickness tested, the lowest germicidal effect (GE) found was still very good (GE of 5, 76 ULog 10). After their wearing and tearing the antimicrobial activity tended to increase passing from 7. 2081 to 8. 29922 LogUnits in panels 80 microns thick. For still hospital working aluminium foils incorporating Silver/Zeolite on panels installed through 2006 and 2008, the antimicrobial action of zeolite was still firmly present even after two years and three years. The germicidal effect standards were maintained even during time on constant values between 7. 477 and 7. 086 LogUnits. The persistence of bactericidal efficacy of Ag+zeolite treatment in all the materials used for the construction of HVAC <b>ductworks</b> can be confirmed...|$|R

2500|$|Principals of {{operation}} use motor driven blowers (fans) {{mounted in the}} cabinet to draw directional mass airflow around a user and into the air grille - protecting the operator. [...] The air is then drawn underneath the work surface and {{back up to the}} top of the cabinet where it passes through the HEPA filters. A column of HEPA filtered, sterile air is also blown downward, over products and processes to prevent contamination. Air is also exhausted through a HEPA filter, and depending on the Type of Class II BSC, the air is either recirculated back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fan, through <b>ductwork</b> where it is expelled from the building.|$|E
2500|$|The Type A1 cabinet, {{formerly}} known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75ft/min.

2500|$|Power {{came from}} a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row 18-cylinder radial engine {{producing}} 2,000hp (1,500kW)—the same engine that would power the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over 400mph (644 kph) in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of 146in (3.7m) in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli's experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine {{was placed in a}} broad cowling that opened at the front in a [...] "horse collar"-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right oil coolers, and the turbosupercharger intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the turbosupercharger turbine {{at the bottom of the}} fuselage about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300rpm. The complicated turbosupercharger system with its <b>ductwork</b> gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was problematic since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the main landing gear struts and so that wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each main gear strut was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out 9in (23cm) when extended.|$|E

[...] In the basement, the four vaults were repurposed into a nightclub, and the iron gate which closed off the vault areas used as the main entrance to the bar. The former main vault became the Bourbon Room, which was decorated with disused safe deposit box covers and keys as well as gears from vault doors.
