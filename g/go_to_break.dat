5000|$|Carrie Snyder (Gladys George) is a prostitute, who {{is forced}} out of the fictional {{southern}} town of Crebillon, after forming a friendship with a young boy named Paul (Jackie Moran), whose dying mother (Janet Young) is unable to protest against her son visiting such a woman. After Carrie has left town Paul runs away from his abusive father (John Wray), and meets a girl named Lady (Charlene Wyatt) who has run away from a burning trainwreck, not wanting {{to go back to the}} people she was with. Carrie comes back for Paul and ends up taking Paul and Lady to New York with her. Carrie gets an apartment and starts a successful chain of laundry stores. Eventually they become very rich and Lady (Arline Judge) grows very attracted to Paul (John Howard). However Paul feels obligated to take care of a young woman named Lili (Isabel Jewell) whose brother's death he caused (the brother had been pushing Paul to try to get on the train, but when Paul pushed back, the train door closed with the brother on the outside with his coat stuck in the train door, causing him to get dragged along with the train and his legs to be run over). Lilli pretends to love Paul because he is rich, which Carrie is able to see, but which Paul does not. She devises a plan to make Lilli leave, if she will bribe some people to help get Lilli's true love out of jail, she will leave Paul. They <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the man out of jail, but they are caught. Lilli is shot dead and Carrie gets sent to jail. An old lawyer friend (Harry Carey) vows to fight for her freedom, but Carrie decides to plead guilty, because she doesn't want Lady to know about her past (her life as a prostitute would be dragged out in court if her case went to trial) and also because she fears that this damage to her reputation would also be bad for the reputation of the children. The lawyer ends by remarking to Paul's employer (Dudley Digges) that, [...] "valiant is the word for Carrie".|$|E
50|$|The Bowery Boys, led by {{the notorious}} Slip Mahoney (Leo Gorcey), are helping out at a boxing arena, selling programs, drinks and snacks to the audience. The most popular {{upcoming}} fight is between their own Jimmy Higgins ”The Battler from the Bowery” (Robert Walcott) and the reigning champion Joey Prince (Bill Cartledge). The fight will be Jimmy’s chance to bring home the title, but his chances are slim at best. When the match starts, Jimmy takes a serious beating in the ring. He is knocked down already in the second round, which renders him unconscious. Eventually Jimmy dies from his injuries. When two of the boys <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the awful news to Jimmy’s mother, Mrs. Higgins (Dorothy Vaughan), she is devastated. The boys decide to help her out, by finding another one of her boys, Johnny (Frankie Darro), who disappeared some time ago. Johnny, who is Jimmy’s older brother, vanished {{to get away from}} a gang of swindlers who played him for a fool and set him up. The boys soon find Johnny in a bar together with a hussy by the name of Bunny Talbot (Evelynn Eaton). Johnny is completely oblivious about his younger brother’s death. He quickly sobers up after getting the news, and the boys start working him into fighting condition. Together with the journalist Gabe Moreno (Gabriel Dell), the boys start promoting a series of fights in benefit for the Higgins family. When Jimmy’s manager, Blinky Harris (Lyle Talbot), wants in on the action, the boys tell him to take a hike, since they consider it his fault that Jimmy died. What the boys don’t know, is that Harris had fixed the fight against Prince, but Jimmy didn’t go along with the plan. Johnny’s first fight is announced, and the training starts in a loft locality the boys get to borrow from their friend Louie (Bernard Gorcey) who owns a candy store. The thumping and crashing from the loft make Louie’s business go bad. Johnny wins his first series of fights, and is considered a challenger to the title. A fight against Prince is set up, and the winner will then fight the title-holder Dynamite Carson (Bert Conway). Johnny’s fight against Prince starts, but when Prince goes down in the first round, he claims that he did so because the match was fixed. The result is that both boxers are suspended from further fighting. Harris is the one who has fixed the fight, and he promises the Bowery Boys that Prince will confess and clear Johnny’s name. The condition is that Johnny loses the first match between him and Carson, and then gets to win the second. The boys agree to the condition, but have no intention of following the plan. Unfortunately they didn’t count on Harris taking Boomer Higgins (Teddy Infuhr), the youngest of the Higgins brothers, as collateral. Harris assures the boys that Boomer will be let out as soon as Johnny has lost the fight. The boys go on a hunt throughout the city to find Boomer, and when they do, they help him escape. Boomer arrives to the ring in time for Johnny to know he is safe, and then Johnny doesn’t have to lose. Harris cheats by giving Carson a metal stick to hold in his hand, and Johnny is badly beaten. Between rounds the boys manage to remove the metal stick and Johnny can get the upper hand in the fight once more. He wins the fight by knocking out Carson, and Harris is exposed as a cheater to the boxing commissioner.|$|E
40|$|Extract] The Senate Standing Committee on Employment Education and Training’s recent Report on Priorities for Reform in Higher Education {{commented that}} Universities have {{produced}} law graduates who “are usually well {{grounded in the}} knowledge and skills essential to the practice” of the legal profession, but who are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession, who are not analytical, creative thinkers, whose education does not provide the basis for adequate flexibility, who are not sufficiently attuned to the need for “lifelong” learning, and who are not good communicators. In short, the Committee noted, “Australia is producing highly training technicians who are under-educated in the broader sense of the term”. A major factor highlighted by the Committee was the low quality of teaching in the education sector. It is difficult to argue against these comments made by the Senate Committee, and their application to law teaching in Australian Universities. They substantially describe my own experience as a law student, researcher and teacher in law schools since 1980. The focus of law teaching in university law schools, with a few notable exceptions is narrow, focusing primarily on exposition of legal doctrine, and rather halfheartedly, its application, with scant regard for the history, philosophy and political economy of the society within which law is practised and enforced. Despite some undoubted progress during the last few decades, law schools still have some way to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down the strong focus of professionalism and specialisation, where “knowledge has become cut up into innumerable separate parcels”, with a “specialist profession” as “custodian and user of each of these parcels”. A few years ago, in a perceptive article about the history of legal scholarship in Australia, Chesterman and Weisbrot pointed out that Australian legal scholarship has been “predominantly positivist” and unquestioning, eschewing any recognition of legal pluralism. A major factor encouraging the development of this approach has been the particularly close link between legal education and the legal profession. 6 Until recently, university law faculties were “generally viewed as adjuncts to the legal profession, rather than truly academic institutions dedicated to liberal educational aims”. Law teaching was carried out mostly by practitioners, and there were very few fulltime academics. Little legal research was done, and the general approach in courses taught was fairly uniform. What distinguished Australian legal education from the English system was that the professional authorities did not themselves take responsibility for the “practitioners” subjects such as Evidence, Procedure and Conveyancing. Instead the law schools became “trade schools” providing almost all of the substantive law courses required for admission to practice. The professional authorities were not prepared to accord recognition for professional entry purposes to a university law degree unless it had a substantial “hard law” content in subjects directly relevant to legal practice. 9 As Chesterman and Weisbrot noted: Australian university law schools, having won the right to be the principal providers of legal education and socialisation, also inherited the imperatives of practice from the profession. This included the empiricist tradition of English legal training, with its emphasis on pragmatic, inductive reasoning, and its lack of concern for sociological jurisprudence...|$|E
