The abundantly available clay minerals are potential sources of SCMs. Thermal treatment of kaolinite clay under moderate temperatures (700 - 1000 K) yields an amorphous phase called metakaolinite, a material that has great promise as a mineral admixture for cement and concrete. However, the optimum properties of metakaolinite are highly dependent on operating temperature and residence time during thermal treatment. This article presents the development of a numerical model for the simulation of dehydroxylation of kaolinite clay using gPROMS (general PROcess Modeling System). Accordingly, a 1 D dehydroxylation model is used to examine the thermal transformation of kaolinite into different phases.

It is clarified that heterogeneous flow structures still exist in systems with elastic and frictionless particle collisions, even though the particles in the emulsion phase are more loosely packed. The flow structures in various flow regimes, including uniform, bubbling and turbulent fluidization, can be reproduced from these simulations. Systems with strong particle fluctuating motion but weak <b>gas</b> <b>suspension</b> display an emulsion-bubble structure. On the contrary, systems with weak particle fluctuation motion tend to produce uniform structures. If these two interactions are equally important, the system features complex flow patterns resembling those displayed in the turbulent fluidization.

The flow regime transition is actually the macro-scale expression of the altering degree of dominance of particle¿particle and particle¿fluid interactions.

This low-cost retrofit project will demonstrate the GSA system {{which is expected to}} remove more than 90 % of the SO{sub 2 } from coal-fired flue gas, while achieving a high utilization of reagent lime. The host site facility will be the STF located at the Shawnee Fossil Plant in West Paducah, Kentucky. Over the past 15 years, the STF has served as a testground for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems. At the present time a semi-dry process employing 10 MW capacity spray dryer is being tested at the facility. Upon completion of the current spray dryer test, the GSA system will be tested for a period of eleven months. The GSA system brings coal combustion gases into contact with a suspended mixture of solids, including sulfur-absorbing lime. After the lime absorbs the sulfur pollutants, the solids are separated from the gases in a cyclone device and recirculated back into the system where they capture additional sulfur pollutant. The cleaned flue gases are sent through a dust collector before being released into the atmosphere. The key to the system`s superior economic performance with high sulfur coals is the recirculation of solids.

40|$|Spark {{discharge}} is {{a method}} for producing nanoparticles from conductive materials. Besides the general advantages of nanoparticle synthesis in the gas phase, the method offers additional advantages like simplicity, compactness and versatility. The synthesis process is continuous and is performed at atmospheric pressure, which is quite economic in comparison with vacuum methods and {{has the potential of}} being scaled up. In addition, it bears unparalleled possibilities of mixing materials. Although the method has extensively been used for research purposes, {{there is a lack of}} systematic study in previous work. This is the main objective of the present thesis. The investigation on the performance of the spark discharge generator revealed that the mean particle size can be tailored via the energy per spark and the particle production rate can be controlled by the spark energy and the spark frequency. Different electrode materials led to different mass production rates, where thermal conductivity, evaporation enthalpy and the boiling point had a major influence. Characterization of the spark generated particles revealed information on sintering, oxidation and structure on all length scales. Besides the nanoparticles, much larger particles are sometimes formed. While the former are formed by vaporization and condensation, the latter arise from dispersion of molten pools on the electrode surface. Agglomeration and sintering of nanoparticles in <b>gas</b> <b>suspension</b> and on substrates are observable through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface determination by adsorption (BET) and mobility analysis, as well as through comparison of the characteristic diameters these methods give. Inter-particle sintering at room temperature was observed and indicated complete absence of adsorbed surface layers. This is an effect of the extreme purity achievable with the spark discharge method. For non-noble metals, oxygen impurities in the carrier gas led to oxide layers on the particle surfaces, which hindered sintering. The merit of the spark generation nanoparticle synthesis process in achieving specific functionalities was demonstrated by examples of successful application. Spark generated Pd nanoparticles showed a hydrogen storage capacity near the theoretical maximum value. Spark generated Mg nanoparticles exhibited a decrease in the hydrogen desorption temperature, which makes them an interesting starting point for new hydrogen storage systems. Furthermore, nanoparticles from spark discharge proved to be interesting materials for production of lithium ion battery electrodes. Flexible mixing of materials on a nano scale down to the atomic scale should give access to an enormous variety of new material properties tunable not only through size but also through mixing ratios. Thus, there is a great interest in developing new methods for synthesis of mixed nanoparticles. The ability of spark discharge to generate mixed metallic and composite nanoparticles is expected to open new fields of application. Electrodes with different degrees of premixing of the constituents were applied to study the composition, texture and structure of the nanoparticulate product. Various miscible and immiscible systems with small and large differences in evaporation rates were studied. In almost all the cases, x-ray diffraction or compositional analysis of the single particles showed evidence of mixing. Using different metals for the positive and the negative electrode it was shown that spark discharge induces mixing, and on the example of the Au-Pd system the effect of operating conditions on mixing was studied. It was observed that the mixing ratio is mainly influenced by the polarity and by the gap distance between the electrodes. The particles produced from various materials are mainly very small compared to other production methods, a few nm in diameter, and in a rather narrow size range. Surprizingly, the size does not show any significant material dependence. A mathematical model derived by Lehtinen et al. (1996) was applied to explain the experimental findings and solved numerically. The model shows agreement with the sizes observed and qualitatively explains the small sizes as a consequence of the large cooling rate in the spark discharge process.

Many cores operating in single-instruction multiple-data mode, such as general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), are employed for direct numerical simulation of the fluid flow at the micro-scale using the lattice Boltzmann method. This architecture is also expected to be efficient for the multi-scale simulation of other complex systems.
