5|$|Around 120,000 prisoners <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> colonies were {{captured}} during the Battle of France. Most of these troops, around two-thirds, came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> North African possessions of Tunisia, Morocco and, particularly, Algeria. Around 20 percent were from French West Africa. The rest were from Madagascar and Indochina. Influenced by Nazi racial ideology, German troops summarily killed between 1,000 and 1,500 black prisoners during the Battle of France.
