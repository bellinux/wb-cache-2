5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1987, {{attempts}} were made to thaw and revive [...] by re-establishing the Egyptian Soviet Friendship Society. Sharaf, with his long experience in eastern block countries, was hand-picked by Boutros Boutros Ghali, then Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, to become secretary of the friendship society. At the time, the society's president was Ghali himself. Prominent Egyptians from diverse fields of interest were invited to join the society. Both men would travel to Moscow to participate in the society's meetings and gatherings of prominent politicians, diplomats, businessmen, academicians, historians, linguists and enthusiasts of Egyptian Soviet relations. Sharaf's visits to Moscow and his extensive travels in the Soviet hinterland convinced him that the Soviet Union was not the superpower he once <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, however, predict its sudden collapse.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1937 season, the Baltimore Orioles sold Abernathy to the Buffalo Bisons, {{also of the}} International League. During a game on August 5, 1938, {{while playing}} with the Bisons, Abernathy was stuck {{in the head by}} a {{baseball}} from the opposing pitcher and was sent to St. Joseph Hospital in Syracuse, New York where he was initially in critical condition. The opposing pitcher who threw the injury-inflicting pitch, Jon Gee of the Syracuse Chiefs, went to the hospital after the game to see Abernathy. Abernathy, whose head was wrapped in bandages, told Gee that he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not throw the pitch at him on purpose. Officially diagnosed with a fractured skull, Abernathy underwent surgery performed by Dr. Brooks McCain and was reportedly in an [...] "improved" [...] condition immediately afterwards. While recovering from his injuries, the Bisons and Chiefs played a benefit game for Abernathy and raised $4,000 ($ in today's standards) to pay his medical bills. On September 3, 1939, Abernathy left the hospital and returned home. During the 1938 season, Abernathy batted [...]323 with 121 hits, 27 doubles, five triples and 21 home runs. Despite being out of play after his injury in 1938, Abernathy still managed to hit the fourth most home runs in the International League.|$|E

2500|$|Looking at {{the leading}} group, it was {{reasonable}} {{to think that}} Ballan, Le Mével or Popovych was going to attack sooner or later, as Freire is a top-class sprinter and would probably beat them all if {{they went to the}} finish line together. Yaroslav Popovych was the first to attack and immediately the French got disappointed as Christophe Le Mével dropped and never managed to come back. Alessandro Ballan however closed the gap and brought Óscar Freire back in his wheel. It was then Freire's turn to attack, but again Ballan closed the gap and now brought back Popovych. Popovych and Freire both took turns in attacking but Ballan seemed to be the strongest as he closed the gap every time. However, after a while he was also getting tired and could not respond to yet another attack by Popovych. He did not get any help from Freire in closing the gap and so Popovych won the stage. Freire <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not deserve the second place and left it to Ballan; however, this could cost him the green jersey in the end. Le Mével finished as fourth and in the peloton it was Tom Boonen who convincingly won the sprint for the fifth place, 4'25" [...] behind Popovych.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fly in the}} {{ointment}} was Connie Mack Stadium. The plan {{assumed a}} $1.5 million cash infusion from Bob Carpenter to buy the old ballpark, and he was anything but enthusiastic about it. [...] "We need that ballpark {{as much as we}} need a hole in the head", he said. Carpenter estimated that modernizing the place would cost a million dollars, and even at that {{it would be impossible to}} enlarge the seating capacity. He also recognized the growing parking problem, as well as the declining affluence of the neighborhood. He tried to pass on the purchase, reminding Johnson that he had a lease until 1957. Johnson responded by threatening to raise the [...] "rent" [...] to 20 cents a head, and to bill the Phillies for stadium upkeep the A's had always paid for. When Carpenter did not show signs of giving in, Johnson said he would call the entire deal off. Carpenter <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have much choice, since no other facility in the Delaware Valley was suitable even for temporary use. [...] Reluctantly, he formed the 21st and Lehigh Realty Company to buy the park for $1.7 million, and collected rent from the Phillies just as the A's had previously—though this effectively resulted in Carpenter transferring money from one pocket to another.|$|E
60|$|Charnock did not answer, {{but gave}} her a curious look, and she pondered {{for a moment or}} two. He was {{obviously}} moved, but one could not tell how far his emotions went, and she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to listen. She understood her husband and knew he sometimes deceived himself.|$|E
6000|$|Reddy {{hung his}} head. [...] "I don't care!" [...] he said, which was very, very foolish, because, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> care {{a very great}} deal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How many? There were five, but I {{think that}} fellow down there sold one; but then I think he bought another. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} be," [...] said Mrs. Burton. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> admire your drawings, Nelie; even those you {{had at the}} fair, that time." ...|$|R
60|$|He gave {{an order}} and two Krooboys got to work. There was no obvious reason for {{lowering}} the sail, but when Wyndham ordered the negroes obeyed. Although they grinned with frank good-humor when Marston talked to them, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not share Wyndham's authority. Yet Harry was not harsh.|$|E
60|$|Of Abraham it is written, {{that what}} he <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> That his faith wrought with his works. And by his works his faith was made perfect. That when he gained faith in God, he went and acted on his faith. When God called him he went out, not knowing whither he went.|$|E
60|$|What {{happened}} {{aboard the}} Arangi Jerry never <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{know that it}} was a world destroyed, for he saw it destroyed. The boy who had knocked him on the head with the paddle, tied his legs securely and tossed him out on the beach ere he forgot him in the excitement of looting the Arangi.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> That evening--a week ago, {{when he was}} squiring me {{home from}} the concert. It was raining, and my face was wet; he said that was why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|Nanda {{looked at}} him with her long grave straight-ness, which had often a play of light beyond any smile. [...] "Oh, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> want more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't mean {{anything}} of that kind, Emily. You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, and you should not say so. It would be too horrible to think of." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mr. Shelby {{knew that}} Haley {{was not a}} nice man. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want Tom for a servant, but only wanted to sell him again, to make more money. So Mr. Shelby said, 'No, I can't do that. I never mean to sell any of my slaves, least of all Tom. He has been with me {{since he was a}} little boy.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{during the}} long February nights with the ewes in labour, looking out from the shelter into the {{flashing}} stars, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not belong to himself. He must admit {{that he was only}} fragmentary, something incomplete and subject. There were the stars in the dark heaven travelling, the whole host passing by on some eternal voyage. So he sat small and submissive to the greater ordering.|$|E
60|$|Three {{years of}} M. Najdol's {{preparations}} {{do not fit}} a man for many careers. His friends, who <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not drink, assumed that Conroy had strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises, and Conroy had with some care invented an imaginary doctor, symptoms, and regimen, which he discussed with them and with his mother in Hereford. She maintained that he would grow out of it, and recommended nux vomica.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes; you {{are always}} good to me; and as to my uncle, I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean to be unkind. I should not fear that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My father! you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not like}} me, my {{presence}} {{is always a}} source of irritation to him, he cannot even bear {{me to look at}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> {{never going}} on no cruise-- [...] <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> and {{finished}} with the sea, [...] And yet he likes to feel she's there to use-- [...] If he should ask her--as she used to be.|$|R
60|$|I heard Don bark. Turning {{the corner}} of the cliff wall I saw him on a narrow shelf. He was coming toward me and when he reached me he faced again to the wall and barked fiercely. The hair on his neck bristled. I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not fancy that narrow strip of rock, nor did I. But a sudden, grim, cold {{something}} had taken possession of me, and I stepped forward.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jordan gave {{a little}} grunt, not unamiable. Paul divined that his master's bark was worse than his bite. Indeed, the little manufacturer, {{although}} he spoke bad English, was quite gentleman enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles. But he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not look like the boss {{and owner of the}} show, so he had to play his role of proprietor at first, to put things on a right footing.|$|E
6000|$|On this {{particular}} day I was soundly rated. [...] "The obstinacy of my whole sex," [...] it seems, was concentrated in me; I had an [...] "orgueil de diable." [...] I feared to fail, forsooth! What did it matter whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should not fail, like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He {{wanted to see me}} worsted (I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did),</b> and one minute he paused to take breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} made me so happy!" [...] she said tremulously. [...] "Oh, you can never know how happy! Nothing hurts now--nothing ever can hurt, because I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> care." ...|$|R
60|$|If it {{concerns}} Tom, don't tell me, please. You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> do ridiculous things at times. But I don't let him worry me any more; so don't worry me about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course Lew likes me. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and I {{want him}} to," [...] said Betty. [...] "But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care as {{you seem to}} think. Grandmother Watkins said the same. I am sure {{both of you are}} wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|But though Tom did not reproach Heale, Heale reproached himself. He {{had just}} {{conscience}} enough left {{to feel the}} whole weight of his abused responsibility, exaggerated and defiled by superstitious horror; and maudlin tipsy, he wandered about the street, moaning that he had murdered his wife, and all the town, and asking pardon of every one he met; till seeing one of the meeting-houses open, he staggered in, in the vain hope of comfort which he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not deserve.|$|E
6000|$|Dan and {{the girls}} and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivia's garden fence, {{watching}} Felix weed. Felix worked well, {{although he did not}} like weeding--"fat boys never do," [...] Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not to hear her, but I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> because his ears grew red. Felix's face never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she did not say things like that out of malice prepense. It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.|$|E
60|$|But then, as Ursula <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} the {{perpetual}} tyranny of young children about him. He treated her mother with great courtliness, to which Mrs. Brangwen returned an easy, friendly hospitality. Something pleased the girl in her mother's calm assumption of state. It seemed impossible to abate Mrs. Brangwen's position. She could never be beneath anyone in public relation. Between Brangwen and Skrebensky there was an unbridgeable silence. Sometimes the two men made a slight conversation, {{but there was no}} interchange. Ursula rejoiced to see her father retreating into himself against the young man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{but that}} is over now. I am to go and live at Scarrowby at once, and have the shooting. He can't want me to remain there all by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] said Wamba, [...] "fool as I am, I {{shall not}} do your fool's errand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou <b>knowest</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not always miss his mark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{exactly the}} same materials," [...] said Will, {{thinking}} {{that he would be}} duly reserved. [...] "He is not an Orientalist, you <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not profess to have more than second-hand knowledge there." ...|$|R
