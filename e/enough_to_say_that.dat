[...] She is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party; she told the BBC Andrew Marr Show in 2010 that she {{had been a member of}} the party [...] "all my life." [...] Thompson endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in both the 2015 and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections. She has also expressed support for the Women's Equality Party.|$|E
500|$|In 1863–1864 {{during the}} American Civil War, Edward {{traveled}} through Europe, taking {{the opportunity to}} visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father {{later on in the}} war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests [...] Edward's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, [...] "I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have gone to Europe to avoid the war." [...] Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom.|$|E

500|$|Peter Timmis of Cross Rhythms gave Move nine stars {{out of ten}} squares, commenting that [...] " [...] If {{you like}} your rock soulful and gospel-tinged then 'Move' is an album you'll want to check out". Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E
500|$|Irene {{has never}} been the most admired of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech. [...] What would be mellifluous in rhyme, is merely monotonous without it.|$|E

[...] Punshon stated that the title story was, [...] "the best, and Mrs Christie is least successful when she enters into the international spy field.

2500|$|Especially {{important}} is Rachmaninoff's use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, {{most notably in}} the choral symphony The Bells, the Second Piano Concerto, the E flat major Étude-Tableaux (Op.33, [...] ), and the B-minor Prelude (Op.32, [...] ). [...] "It is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the church bells of Novgorod, St Petersburg and Moscow influenced Rachmaninov and feature prominently in his music. This much is self-evident. What is extraordinary is the variety of bell sounds and breadth of structural and other functions they fulfil." [...] He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He uses them most perceptibly in his Vespers, but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening melody of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (The opening melody of the Third Piano Concerto, on the other hand, is not derived from chants; when asked, Rachmaninoff said that [...] "it had written itself".) ...|$|E

2500|$|Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems {{referred}} {{to the role of}} the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that [...] "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.

2500|$|The {{first two}} letters of Ecruliani's {{treatise}} were addressed to Giorgio Garnero (1550-1614), [...] "a Burgundian medical writer", while the third letter consisted of his responses to her philosophical viewpoints. [...] In {{an excerpt from}} Erculiani's letter to Garnero, she speculated that the Biblical flood occurred because of an imbalance between earth and man: [...] " [...] occurred because men's presence on earth had increased so much in number, size, and lifespan, that {{around the time of}} the sin, the earth element, which dominates men, was much diminished; nor had it been replenished for centuries, with the result that [...] was so greatly diminished that it was necessarily swallowed up by water, which had contributed little of itself to [...] men."Erculiani later followed up the statement within her fourth letter, addressed to Queen Anna's [...] "chancellor for Transylvania", Martin Berzevicy (1538-1596), who visited Padua in 1568. [...] She expressed her belief that God and nature work in unison: [...] "it is true that the doctors of the church and the divine theologians have put forth different causes and reasons; but for me, it is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God and Nature herself do not contradict those causes, but He makes use of her in His works." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was another}} point on {{which there was}} no agreement. A large {{minority}} wished to retain episcopacy, and to keep the Book of Common Prayer [...] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical Presbyterian, but the bishops had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the Puritans as verging on Papacy that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked. [...] Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon monarchy, and, when the majority of the House of Lords arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.|$|E
