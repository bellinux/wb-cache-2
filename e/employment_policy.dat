25|$|The Blue Eagle At Work {{was highly}} {{anticipated}} by many labor scholars, labor attorneys and {{activists in the}} labor movement. After its publication, the work was widely reviewed in the scholarly and labor press, including Labor Studies Journal, the Journal of Industrial Relations, WorkingUSA, Labor History, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, Employee Rights and <b>Employment</b> <b>Policy</b> Journal, LRA Online, Labor Research Association, British Journal of Industrial Relations, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, Hawaii Laborer, ILCA Online, Portside, The Progressive Populist, Workday Minnesota, Religious Socialism, All Aboard, NLRB, Labour/Le Travail, Noteworthy Books in Industrial Relations and Labor Economics, Princeton University, Benson's Union Democracy Blog, University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business and Employment Law, and the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. Some of the reviews expressed greater or lesser degrees of skepticism about the likelihood of Morris' thesis being adopted but praised the work highly.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{prominent}} party was the UNP, the United National Party. In the first parliamentary elections, the UNP gained 42 {{out of the}} 95 seats available, and also won the elections in 1952. When the first prime minister, D. S. Senanayake, died of a stroke, his son Dudley Senanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, was appointed as prime minister. In 1956, the radical socialist SLFP (Sri Lanka Freedom Party) won the elections, and Solomon Bandaranaike took power. He was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959 and his widow, Sirimavo, succeeded him {{as leader of the}} SLFP. She held office until 1977, with two exceptions in 1960 and 1965–1970, when the UNP held power. During her rule, she implemented a radical economic program of nationalisation and land reform, a pro-Sinhalese educational and <b>employment</b> <b>policy,</b> and an independent foreign policy as part of the non-aligned movement.|$|E
500|$|Linfield are {{generally}} regarded as a 'Protestant club' and draw {{the vast majority of}} their support {{from one side of the}} community. However, the squad itself is one of the most diverse in the Irish League. The club has also been regarded as sectarian in the past, both in respect of its alleged <b>employment</b> <b>policy</b> and of the behaviour of its fans. This sectarian reputation is partly the result of the actions of fans who have a history of occasional anti-Catholic behaviour ranging from sectarian chanting on the terraces to outright violence. Part of the problem has been attributed to Windsor Park's location in a part of Belfast that is predominantly Protestant. A relatively small number of local Catholics played for the club during the Troubles, which led to an accusation that the club held a historical policy of not signing Catholic players. However, the existence of such a policy has been disputed: ...|$|E

40|$|The European Employment Strategy (EES) and {{the process}} of Open Method of Coordination (OMC) have key roles in {{ensuring}} that the European Member States reach the Lisbon Targets by 2010. The EES promotes active <b>employment</b> <b>policies,</b> and this dissertation compares and analyses active <b>employment</b> <b>policies</b> in three welfare states; United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands. The analysis focuses on whether or not active <b>employment</b> <b>policies</b> in the three countries have converged towards the recommendations of the EES. The impact of the EES and OMC is widely discussed, and some of the main problems concern whether OMC has the ‘power’ to change welfare states. A macro-oriented regime framework for analysing the characteristics of different employment regimes is developed, including a distinction between path-dependent and path-breaking changes. Based on these distinctions, a categorisation of the regimes according to the three possible combinations of categories of instruments is utilised when establishing the development in the countries’ active <b>employment</b> <b>policies.</b> The study reveals that the countries’ different historical and institutional legacies mostly influence developments in national <b>employment</b> <b>policies</b> prior to 1997, and, hence, that the countries’ policy-developments are relatively path-dependent. But in the period after the launch of EES (after 1998) the study reveals that cross-country tendencies and convergence have emerged, which cannot be explained by the national policy-paths. Features of active <b>employment</b> <b>policies</b> and the rhetorical understanding of problems and solutions regarding unemployment have, to a varying extent, converged within the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands...|$|R
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of Durham County Council on 26 July 1944, J.W. Foster, {{chairman}} of the Finance Committee of the council, spoke in favour of the proposals, claiming they would fulfill the Government's White Paper on <b>Employment</b> <b>Policy,</b> and its policy on the rehabilitation of depressed areas. [...] At the outbreak of war, {{the north of the}} country had still not fully recovered from the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Foster believed the employment the station's construction and maintenance provided would help prevent a return to those conditions. It was also seen that the station would generally improve the supply of electricity for industry. He pointed out that the criticism of the scheme was based entirely on assumption that the station would [...] "destroy the Medieval charm of the city", without taking into account the thoughts of the experts who designed the station. He also pointed out that the critics made their comments without any suggestion of an alternative, and that their campaign against the scheme had attracted publicity through a BBC broadcast.|$|E

2500|$|Employees are {{important}} in any running of a business; without them the business would be unsuccessful. However, more and more employers today are finding that employees remain for approximately 23 to 24 months, according to the 2006 Bureau of Labor Statistics. The <b>Employment</b> <b>Policy</b> Foundation states that it costs a company an average of $15,000per employee, which includes separation costs, including paperwork, unemployment; vacancy costs, including overtime or temporary employees; and replacement costs including advertisement, interview time, relocation, training, and decreased productivity when colleagues depart.|$|E

2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] was {{nothing to do with the}} promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed to fall outside the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to <b>employment</b> <b>policy</b> he brought was one of upholding labour market flexibility. The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, and he sat in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E
