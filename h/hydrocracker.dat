40|$|This paper {{present some}} results {{obtained}} from the research program being pursued at the Research Institute of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals aimed at the development of suitable catalysts for hydrocracking of the vacuum gas oils from Arabian Light crude to obtain higher quality distillate products. The newly developed high-performance hydroprocessing catalysts are based on synthetic smectite clays and modified zeolites. Active metals have been incorporated into these novel supports to prepare several catalyst formulations for both stages of the conventional fixed-bed <b>hydrocrackers.</b> These novel catalysts have been characterized by sophisticated techniques and evaluated in different types of reactors (such as Pulse Microreactor, Batch Autoclave reactor, Fixed-bed Flow reactor etc.) using different feedstocks (e. g. model compounds and real VGO). Some of the formulations of developed catalysts have exhibited high performance in terms of hydrodesulfurization and cracking activities when compared to commercial catalysts under the same operating conditions. These catalysts are being further developed, comprehensively characterized, and thoroughly evaluated in order {{to come up with}} tailor-made catalyst formulations for hydrocracking of heavy petroleum fractions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDevelopment {{of models}} for {{industrial}} <b>hydrocrackers</b> {{has received a}} great amount of attention by the scientific community over the past decades. Two fundamentally different modelling approaches are compared in this paper: a continuous lumping model with three families (paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and a single events microkinetic model. The aim is to demonstrate the differences in the capabilities of the two modelling frameworks. Both models are capable of simulating experimental data from hydrocracking of a pre-treated Vacuum Gas Oil in a pilot plant at industrial conditions. The continuous lumping model provides better results of the macroscopic effluent characteristics, such as yield structure and PNA (Paraffin, Naphthene, Aromatic) distribution in the middle distillate cut. It requires only the feed SIMDIS (Simulated Distillation) and PNA composition to be known. The single events model, on the other hand, provides information which is not available in a simple continuous lumping model. An analysis of the reaction kinetics of paraffins and mono-naphthenes is performed to demonstrate this aspect. The single events model is far more complex and computationally expensive than the continuous lumping model. In conclusion, the two approaches should be considered complementary rather than competitive. In conjunction, they can be used to balance the drawbacks of each individual modelling approac...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to determine the}} conditions for the hydrogen-heavy oil feed preparation so as to optimize the yield of hydrocracking reactions. Proper contacting of hydrogen with heavy oil on the catalytic bed is necessary to improve the yields of the hydrocracking reactions. It is most desirable to have the necessary amount of hydrogen available either in the dissolved or in entrained state, so that hydrogen diffusion to the reaction site does not provide rate controlling resistance to the overall rates of hydrocracking reactions. This project proposes to measure solubility and entrainment data for hydrogen in heavy oils at conditions such as in <b>hydrocrackers,</b> and investigate the improvement of these properties by usage of appropriate additives. Specifically, measurements will be carried out at temperatures up to 300 {degrees} C and pressures up to 120 atmospheres. Correlations for solubility and entrainment kinetics will be developed from the measured data, and a method for estimating yield of hydrocracking reactions using these correlations will be suggested. Exxon Research and Engineering Company will serve as private sector collaborator providing A&T with test samples and some technical expertise that will assure successful completion of the project. The final experimental measurements for hydrogen solubility in hydrocarbons are in progress. The novel experimental apparatus has been successfully operated for these measurements. The calibration procedures and some of the initial data measurements are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{dependency}} {{on fossil fuels}} and the associated price and supply chain risk increase {{the need for more}} efficient utilisation of existing non-renewable energy sources. Carbon capture and hydrogen purification technologies are expected to {{play a key role in}} the future low-carbonised energy matrix. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCCs) are one of the emerging clean coal technologies which pave the way for producing power from coal with a higher net power efficiency than conventional PC-fired boiler power plants. It is also advantageous that in an IGCC power plant a carbon capture unit can be applied to a stream having a very high CO 2 partial pressure ahead of gas combustion that would not be available in case of a PC-fired boiler power plant, leading to less energy penalty involved in carbon capture. At the same time, the production of ultrapure hydrogen is both a sought target and an appropriate environmental solution because it is commonly utilised as feedstock in refineries’ hydrotreaters and <b>hydrocrackers</b> as well as energy carrier in fuel cells. A high purity of hydrogen has been commercially produced out of raw synthesis gas using a Hydrogen Pressure Swing Adsorption (H 2 PSA) process. In this thesis, it was aimed to design and optimise a bespoke H 2 PSA system tailored for a decarbonised syngas feed originating from a carbon capture unit. Therefore, a novel H 2 PSA has been studied that is applied to an advanced IGCC plant for cogenerating power and ultrapure hydrogen (99. 99 + mol...|$|R
