40|$|The Cerro Prieto {{geothermal}} field is a liquid-dominated geothermal reservoir of complex geological and hydrological structure. It {{is located at}} the southern end of the Salton-Mexicali trough which includes other geothermal anomalies as Heber and East Mesa. Although in 1973, the <b>initial</b> power plant <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> was 75 MW of electrical power, this amount increased to 180 MW in 1981 as field development continued. It is expected to have a generating capacity of 620 MW by the end of 1985, when two new plants will be completely in operation. Questions about field deliverability, reservoir life and ultimate recovery related to planned installations are being presently asked. Numerical modeling studies can give very valuable answers to these questions, even at the early stages in the development of a field. An effort to simulate the Cerro Prieto geothermal reservoir has been undergoing for almost two years. A joint project among Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas (IIE) and Intercomp of Houstin, Texas, was created to perform reservoir engineering and simulation studies on this field. The final project objective is tosimulate the behavior of the old field region when production from additional wells located in the undeveloped field zones will be used for feeding the new power plants...|$|R

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the Fig.  4 that the EENS index {{decreases}} as the <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> of the TPGS or WPGS increases. However, the impact of increasing <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> of the TPGS is larger than that of increasing <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> of the WPGS. The difference becomes more significant as the increased <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> is larger. It is reasonable to judge that the reliability of the hybrid generation system is more sensitive to the TPGS than the WPGS. This is because the power system can obtain more power from the TPGS than the WPGS on the average when they have the same increased <b>installed</b> <b>capacity</b> since in general, tidal power has less randomness than wind power.|$|R
