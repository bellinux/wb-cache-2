Substrate specimens of alumina and zirconia were air particle abraded with <b>dialuminium</b> <b>trioxide</b> before priming and application of composite resin. Priming was made with gamma metharyloxy-trimethoxysilane or acryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane monomer after which the intermediate dimethacrylate resin was applied and photopolymerized. This was followed by cur-ing particulate composite resin cement (Relyx ARC) to the substrate as a resin stub. The ageing methods of the specimens (n= 6) were: (1) they stored four years in 37 ± 1 ºC distilled water, (2) thermocycled 8000 times between 55 ± 1 ºC and 5 ± 1 ºC, (3) stored first in water for four years and then thermocycled. Specimens which were stored dry, were used as controls. Bonding of composite resin was measured by shear-bond strength test set-up. Both thermocycling and long-term water storage decreased significantly shear bond strength values compared to the control group (from the level of 20 MPa to 5 MPa) regardless of the used primer or the type of the substrate. Combination of four years water storage and thermocyling reduced the bond strength even more, to the level of two to three megapascals. In can be concluded that water storage and thermocycling itselves, and especially combination of water storage and thermocycling can cause considerable reduction in the bond strength of composite resin cement to alumina and zirconia...|$|E
