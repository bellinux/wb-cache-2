5|$|Vertebrates {{including}} {{several species of}} frog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among the mammals, deimatic <b>displays</b> are found in species with strong defences, such as in foul-smelling skunks and spiny porcupines.

5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} <b>displays</b> involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight.

They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship <b>displays</b> are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many wall-size <b>display</b> {{systems are}} built to provide {{large-scale}} visualization. These systems {{may be quite}} successful for some limited applications, but are very inflexible, since these systems only have fixed <b>display</b> regions. This paper integrates steerable projectors whose beam can be moved under computer control onto a wall-size <b>display</b> system to strengthen its <b>display</b> ability. With the steerable projectors, the integrated <b>display</b> system, named Flexible <b>Display,</b> provide an extendable <b>display</b> region. This consists of a large-scale <b>display</b> region and several movable <b>display</b> regions, such that the integrated <b>display</b> system has great potential {{in the area of}} human-computer interaction and information visualization. This paper applies the Flexible <b>Display</b> to a virtual museum application to give the users fluent navigation experience.

40|$|Abstract — Electronic {{information}} <b>display</b> {{systems are}} widely used in public places. The increase in use of light-emitting diodes (LED) <b>display</b> arouses our interest in the effective methods of <b>displaying</b> dynamics text. In order to overcome the limitations of screen size of the <b>display</b> units, numerous means of presenting moving materials on dynamic <b>display</b> have been invented. However, in the past, researchers only focused on the studies of dynamic text <b>display</b> on small screens such as cellular phones, pagers and desktop phones and some researches concern about the optimal dynamic text <b>display</b> in website design. So far, no studies have been found on LED <b>display</b> board for optimal <b>display</b> method. There are many factors that would affect the readability of electronic text. This paper reviews some related empirical studies concerning the various <b>display</b> methods of dynamic text presentation. The factors explored in this review are the text <b>display</b> type, character type, text <b>display</b> direction, and text/background color combination. The review {{would be helpful to}} researchers in formulating further research plans and methodology for determining the optimum dynamic text <b>display</b> methods on LED <b>display</b> boards.
