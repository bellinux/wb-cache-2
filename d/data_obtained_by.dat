25|$|The three moons {{mentioned}} above add new plasma into the magnetosphere. By far the strongest source is Enceladus, which ejects {{a fountain of}} water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen through cracks in its south pole region. A fraction of this gas is ionized by the hot electrons and solar ultraviolet radiation and {{is added to the}} co-rotational plasma flow. Titan once was thought to be the principal source of plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere, especially of nitrogen. The new <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> Cassini in 2004–2008 established {{that it is not a}} significant source of nitrogen after all, although it may still provide significant amounts of hydrogen (due to dissociation of methane). Dione is the third moon producing more new plasma than it absorbs. The mass of plasma created in the vicinity of it (about 6g/s) is about 1/300 as much as near Enceladus. However, even this low value can not be explained only by sputtering of its icy surface by energetic particles, which may indicate that Dione is endogenically active like Enceladus. The moons that create new plasma slow the motion of the co-rotating plasma in their vicinity, which leads to the pile-up of the magnetic field lines in front of them and weakening of the field in their wakes—the field drapes around them. This is the opposite to what is observed for the plasma-absorbing moons.|$|E
500|$|The age of {{the last}} {{eruption}} is controversial. In 1994, radiocarbon dating yielded an age of 10,700 ± 800 years Before Present from a pyroclastic flow. Later, paleosoils and other samples from the same flow were used to deduce similar ages of over 36,770, 42,650, over 35,670 and over 35,520 years before present, respectively. Thus this youngest age estimate was discarded. In 2010, further research identified two younger eruptions, one occurring 39,000 years Before Present and the other 27,500 years Before Present. Other <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> uranium-thorium dating indicate an age of 32,600 ± 1,000 years ago for the youngest eruption. Both of these eruptions took place at St. Ana and imply a repose period between eruptions of over 10,000 years. Much older dates obtained by potassium-argon dating are not considered reliable. Alternatively, the latest eruption may have occurred at a satellite vent seeing as sedimentation of the St. Ana lake has been ongoing since 26,000 years ago. These two recent eruptions were fed by different magmas, with the younger eruption coming from deeper magma chambers ( [...] versus [...] ) and involving more primitive magma. The youngest eruption was probably very violent; the Roxolany Tephra which {{may be associated with}} it has been found as far as Odessa, Ukraine, [...] away from Ciomadul. If the Roxolany Tephra was formed by the youngest eruption of Ciomadul, the youngest eruption would have occurred 29,600 calibrated radiocarbon years ago based on independent dates of the tephra.|$|E

2500|$|The uplift {{has taken}} place in two {{distinct}} stages. [...] The initial uplift following deglaciation was almost immediate due to the elastic response of the crust as the ice load was removed. [...] After this elastic phase, uplift proceeded by slow viscous flow so the rate of uplift decreased exponentially after that. [...] Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1cm/year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the GPS <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> the BIFROST GPS network. Studies suggest that rebound will continue for about at least another 10,000 years. [...] The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred metres near the centre of rebound.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, a {{model of}} a protein will be more {{accurate}} the more fit the actual molecule that represents and will be more precise as there is less uncertainty about the positions of their atoms. In practice there is no [...] "standard molecule" [...] against which to compare models of proteins, so the accuracy of a model is given by the degree of agreement between the model and a set of experimental data. Historically, the structures determined by NMR have been, in general, of lower quality than those determined by X-ray diffraction. This is due, in part, to the lower amount of information contained in <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> NMR. Because of this fact, it has become common practice to establish the quality of NMR ensembles, by comparing it against the unique conformation determined by X-ray diffraction, for the same protein. However, the X-ray diffraction structure may not exist, and, since the proteins in solution are flexible molecules, a protein represented by a single structure may lead to underestimate the intrinsic variation of the atomic positions of a protein. A set of conformations, determined by NMR or X-ray crystallography may be a better representation of the experimental data of a protein than a unique conformation.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{personal}} genome sequence to {{be determined}} was that of Craig Venter in 2007. [...] Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples.

[...] However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort {{the decision was made to}} switch from sequencing a composite sample to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. [...] Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. [...] Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome. [...] In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. [...] Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released, including those of Desmond Tutu, and of a Paleo-Eskimo.
