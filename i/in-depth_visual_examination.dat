40|$|AIM: To {{analyze and}} study the changes of intraocular pressure(IOP), visual field and P-ERG on {{patients}} with big cup/disk(C/D) in 24 h. METHODS: A total of 120 cases(240 eyes) diagnosed with big C/D(C/D> 0. 3) were divided into group A(C/D RESULTS: There was no significant statistical difference in the 24 h average IOP(P > 0. 05) among the three groups, while the amplitudes had significant statistical differences(P P P P P > 0. 05); Compared with group A, the MD and the PSD were significantly higher in group B, and the difference was of statistical significance(P P > 0. 05), but there were significant statistical differences in amplitudes(P P P > 0. 05); Compared with group A, the P 50 's amplitude of group B was significantly lower, and the difference was of statistical significance(P CONCLUSION: When the patients' C/D is no less than 0. 6, there are obvious changes of 24 h IOP, static threshold visual field and P-ERG's P 50 wave. For patients with big C/D, a single IOP examination is far from sufficient, so an <b>in-depth</b> <b>visual</b> function <b>examination</b> should be performed. Meanwhile, it's feasible to regard C/D 0. 6 as a screening criterion for suspected glaucoma...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{validity}} of detection of obscure fissure caries extending into dentine by clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination,</b> Diagnodent or their combination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> on fissures of molars with no obvious cavitation was performed on university students with air drying and under optimal lighting. DIAGNOdent was used to detect dentine fissure caries. Biopsy was then performed during restorative treatment of the studied fissures. This was used as reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination,</b> Diagnodent with different cut-off points and their combinations were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 145 first and second permanent molars in 41 students aged 20 ± 2 years were examined. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical visual detection of caries extending into dentine were 0. 89 and 0. 44 respectively. The sensitivity and specificity using DIAGNODent with the recommended cut-off point 20 were 0. 94 and 0. 14 respectively. When the cut off point was increased to 35, the sensitivity & specificity values were both changed to 0. 75. Caries detection {{by a combination of}} clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> and DIAGNOdent reading 35 had the highest sum of sensitivity & specificity (0. 71 + 0. 90). CONCLUSION: The validity of caries detection on obscure fissure caries extending into dentine using DIAGNODent with the commended cut-off point 20 was not substantially better than by clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination.</b> A combination of clinical <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> and Diagnodent with a cut-off point 35 gave a satisfactory level on both sensitivity and specificity of detection of fissure caries extending into dentine.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{diagnostic}} performance for the detection of caries using photographs with an established <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> method and histological sections as the reference standard. Methods 50 extracted permanent teeth were assessed for the presence of occlusal caries by 9 examiners using two methods; traditional <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> developed by BASCD and photographs produced by an intra-oral camera. For both methods, diagnoses were made at “caries into dentine” level. The teeth were histologically sectioned and the diagnostic decisions using visual and photographic assessment were compared to the histological reference standard. Inter- and intra- examiner reliability for the methods was assessed and weighted kappa values were calculated. Results The <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> method had a median sensitivity value of 65. 6 % and a median specificity value of 82. 4 %. The photographic assessments method had a median sensitivity of 81. 3 % and a median specificity of 82. 4 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{performance}} of the DIAGNOdent 2095 with <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> for occlusal caries detection in permanent and primary molars. The sample comprised 148 permanent human molars and 179 primary human molars. The samples were measured and visually examined three times by two examiners. After measurement, the teeth were histologically prepared and assessed for caries extension. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were calculated. Intra-class correlation (ICC), unweighted kappa and the Bland and Altman method were used to assess inter- and intra-examiner reproducibility. DIAGNOdent showed higher specificity and lower sensitivity than did <b>visual</b> <b>examination.</b> The ICC values indicated an excellent agreement between the examinations.

40|$|Aim: Accurate {{detection}} and diagnosis of caries in primary molars is challenging, especially for proximal lesions where direct <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> is difficult. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this in-vivo and in-vitro study was to assess the validity, reproducibility and acceptability of a laser fluorescence pen and compare these outcomes with those of conventional methods of proximal caries detection in primary molar teeth. Methods: Eighty-two children (aged 5 - 10 yrs) were recruited. Initially 1030 proximal surfaces were clinically examined using meticulous <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> (ICDAS), bitewing radiographs, and a laser fluorescence device (LF pen). Temporary tooth separation (TTS) was achieved for 447 surfaces and these surfaces were re-examined visually (ICDAS) and by the LF pen. The teeth were subsequently extracted and serially sectioned for histological validation. Proximal surfaces were further assessed in-vitro using direct <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> and the LF pen. The validity of all diagnostic methods was assessed.

The <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> of fissures was based on the Ekstrand classification system.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effi- ciency of three diagnostic methods of bite-wing radiography, DIAGNOdent, and visu- al examination in diagnosing the incipient occlusal caries of permanent first molars. Materials and Methods:  In this diagnostic cross-sectional study, 109 premanent first molar teeth of 31 patients aged 7 - 13 years were examined visually by bite-wing radi- ograghy, and DIAGNOdent. Scoring of <b>visual</b> and radiography <b>examinations</b> were based on the Ekstrand classification. <b>Visual</b> <b>examination</b> after pit and fissure opening was used as the gold standard. ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristics) was used to define the best cut-off point for DIAGNodent compareing with gold standard and inter-examiner reproductibility of visual, radiography were assessed using Kappa test and ICC (Intraclass Correlation) wase used for DIAGNOdent values. R esults: The sensitivity of detecting caries that had extended into the enamel was 81. 4 %, 86. 3 %, and 81. 4 % for <b>visual</b> <b>examination,</b> DIAGNOdent, and radiography, respectively. Moreover, the specificity was 100 %, 71. 4 %, and 100 % for visual obser- vation, DIAGNOdent, and radiography, respectively in the enamel. The Kappa index for inter-examiner correlation was 0. 7 and 0. 8 for <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> and radiog- raphy, respectively.
