40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, world {{population}} grew at a record pace, both in absolute and relative terms, from 2. 5 billion to 6 billion (or 1. 75 percent annually). Demographers have long identified rapid mortality declines as the main explanation. This article finds that one-fourth of today's world population is alive because of mortality improvements since mid-century. Very rapid growth is unlikely to continue as substantial <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> also occurred in recent decades. This article finds that already by the year 2000, these <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> have almost exactly compensated for the impact of mortality declines from mid-century levels.

First, the impact of <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> will soon and significantly exceed that of mortality declines.

500|$|Walker {{also took}} an {{interest}} in demographics later in his career, particularly towards the issues of immigration and birth rates. He published The Growth of the United States in 1882 and Restriction on Immigration in 1896 arguing for increasing restrictions out of concern about the diminished industrial and intellectual capacity of the most recent wave of immigrants. Walker also argued that unrestricted immigration was the major reason behind nineteenth-century Native American <b>fertility</b> <b>decline,</b> but while the argument was politically popular and became widely accepted in mobilizing restrictions on immigration, it rested upon a surprisingly facile statistical analysis that was later refuted. Writing on immigrants from southern Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Russia in The Atlantic, Walker claimed, [...] "The entrance into our political, social, and industrial life of such vast masses of peasantry, degraded below our utmost conceptions, is a matter which no intelligent patriot can look upon without the gravest apprehension and alarm. These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of the olden time. They are beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them, as centuries were on the side of those who formerly came to us. They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which fit men to take up readily and easily the problem of self-care and self-government, such as belong to those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak-trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a move away from a unifying but teleological {{framework}} for studying <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> can only been intellectually emancipating and is a necessary precondition for scientific advance. The study of change in human reproduction is an immensely complex and multi-faceted problem which requires the combination of both quantitative and qualitative forms of evidence and their respective methodologies of enquiry. The theoretical challenge is to construct an intellectually facilitating heuristic framework for synthesis of comparative, multidisciplinary study of the multiple <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> that have occurred, not to seek a replacement 'general narrative' for discredited demographic transition and modernization theories. Quantitative historical demography can only gain in its explanatory power by engaging with studies which also incorporate research into such qualitative aspects of gender as sex and power and which address a more historicist {{understanding of the role}} of culture by exploring its relationship with institutions, ideology and politics. It is argued that a number of recent, contextualized local and comparative studies of <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> are demonstrating how productively to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to explore rigorously these aspects of the history of <b>fertility</b> <b>declines.</b> Within the heuristic framework envisaged here, priorities for further research in the future would include exploring comparatively the relationship between reproductive change and communication communities with respect to the ideologically and politically-mediated issues of sex, religion, health, disease and education.

By boosting food supplies and fostering development, the technologies were expected to create "breathing space" for completing demographic transitions there. This paper uses District-level data from rural India on agricultural transformation (from 1961 to 1981) and on changes in human fertility (from 1971 to 1981) to examine whether they did so. In a reduced form model, female literacy and marriage rates emerged as strong fertility change determinants; effects varied by age cohort.

2500|$|According to a 2017 {{study in}} the Journal of Economic Perspectives, it is {{complicated}} to evaluate {{the effects of the}} one-child policy on family outcomes because the Chinese government had already enacted aggressive family planning policy before the introduction of the one-child policy; seen a sharp drop in fertility rates before the enactment of the one-child policy; the one-child policy coincided with Chinese economic reform which would have contributed to reduced fertility rates; and other developing East Asian countries also experienced sharp declines in fertility rates. According to the study, [...] "In general, very different views exist on how the one-child policy affected fertility: one group of studies argued that the one-child policy had a significant or decisive effect on fertility in China, while another group argued that socioeconomic development {{played a key role in}} China’s <b>fertility</b> <b>decline.</b> A plausible reconciliation of these views is that the one-child policy accelerated the already-occurring drop in fertility for a few years, but in the longer term, economic development played a more fundamental role in leading to and maintaining China’s low fertility level. To put it more bluntly, China’s fertility might well have dropped to the current low level with rapid economic development, even without the one-child policy, although the timeline of the decline would not appear quite the same." ...|$|E

Such programs are a new phenomenon. In some LDCs increasing birth-control practice and <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> occurred along with considerable social and economic development, but even there rapid changes among the disadvantaged masses are generally associated with strong family planning programs. Fertility has also fallen in some countries with only some development but with vigorous family planning programs. China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are such cases. In such places as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, fertility generally remains quite high, apparently because of little development and traditional familial institutions.

40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades {{reproductive}} behavior has changed rapidly in much of the developing world. The average total fertility rate (TFR) has fallen by half from the tradit ional six or more to near three today, and contraceptive use – once rare – is now widespread. Between the early 1960 s and the late 1990 s the largest <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> occurred in Asia (- 52 per cent) and Latin America (- 55 per cent) and the smallest in sub-Saharan Africa (- 15 per cent) (United Nations 2001). Differences among countries are even larger, with some completing the transition to replacement fertility in record time (e. g., China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea), while others (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa) have seen little change in reproductive behavior. These recent <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> have been more rapid and pervasive than had been expected. For example, although the medium variant projections prepared by the United Nations Population Division in the 1970 s and 1980 s correctly predicted widespread <b>fertility</b> <b>declines</b> by the 1990 s, the actual levels in the 1990 s were even lower than these projections indicated for some world regions.

40|$|The first {{demographic}} transition started in many Western industrialized societies around {{the latter part}} of the nineteenth century with steady mortality improvement. Expectation of life at birth, about 40 years at the start of the transition, has now doubled (Riley 2001). <b>Fertility</b> <b>declined</b> from a level of about five children to under two children per woman over the same period (Coale and Watkins 1986; Chesnais 1993; Dyson 2010).
