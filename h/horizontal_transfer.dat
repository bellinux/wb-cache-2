They have {{separately}} {{evolved in}} both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous {{to that of other}} polymerases. It is presumed that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.|$|E

The cagA gene codes for a relatively long (1186-amino acid) protein. The cag pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system. The low GC-content of the cag PAI relative {{to the rest of the}} Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> from another bacterial species.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E

In this review, these transfers and similar, previously reported events are discussed and reanalysed to portray the interrelationships between the species that allowed the occurrence of so many <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfers.</b> The paper also addresses problems that may arise in drawing inferences about the time period during which the <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfers</b> occurred and the factors that may be associated with these transfers are discussed...|$|R

The discovery of Chromera velia with similar structure to the apicomplexanss, provides an important link in the evolutionary history of the apicomplexans and dinophytes.

If a fragment of the genome strongly deviates from the genomic signature, this {{is a sign of}} a potential <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer.</b> For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see Figure 2), GC content of a genome segment is a simple genomic signature. Commonly used genomic signatures include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, or structural features of the genome.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> to evolution has been controversial {{since it was}} suggested to be a force driving evolution in the microbial world. In this paper, I review the current standpoint on <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> in evolutionary thinking and discuss how important <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> is in evolution in the broad sense, and particularly in prokaryotic evolution.

Moreover, I discuss the feasibility of reconstructing ancient phylogenetic relationships in the face of <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer.</b> Finally, I discuss how <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> fits in the current neo-Darwinian evolutionary paradigm and conclude {{there is a need for}} a new evolutionary paradigm that includes <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> as well as other mechanisms in the explanation of evolution...|$|R
40|$|Objective : {{to study}} {{the role of the}} {{intercellular}} interactions in the progression of the cancer cells resistance to metformin, a biguanide antidiabetic drug exhibited the marked anti-tumor activity. Results. Earlier we have demonstrated the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transferring</b> of hormonal resistance of breast cancer cells  from cell to cell, and showed the key role of exosomes on the transferring of the resistance. Here we have shown the effect of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>transferring</b> of metformin resistance in breast cancer cells – similar to the progression of hormonal resistance. We found that <b>horizontal</b> <b>transferring</b> of the metformin resistance is mediated via exosomes secreted by the resistant cells. The proteome analysis of the exosomes revealed several proteins differentially expressed in the exosomes of metformin-resistant cells and associated with the regulation of cell response to apoptotic drugs. Conclusions. Totally, the data presented demonstrate the new mechanism of the development of the cancer cell resistance based on the intercellular interactions, opening the new insights in the target therapy of breast cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Genetics has {{traditionally}} focused on vertical gene transfer, {{which is the}} passing of the genetic material of an organism to its offspring. However, recent studies in genetics increased the awareness that <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer,</b> which is {{the passing of the}} genetic material of an organism to another organism that is not its offspring, is also a significant phenomenon. <b>Horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> is thought {{to play a major role}} in the natural evolution of bacteria, such as, when several different types of bacteria all suddenly develop the same drug resistance genes. Artificial <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> occurs in genetic engineering. This thesis provides methods to detect <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> among bacteria using BLAST and DaliLite measures of protein sequence and structural similarities. This research is novel and unique because no previous <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> study worked directly on protein sequences and structures. The main method is a computer algorithm to detect <b>horizontal</b> gene <b>transfer</b> among different COG classifications of proteins. The thesis also considers visual structural comparisons and sequence alignments using the ‘Jmol’ tool. Finally, the thesis considers the possibility that the method yields false positives...|$|R
25|$|The first models which {{tried to}} explain the {{clustering}} of genes were, of course, focused on operons because they were discovered before eukaryote gene clusters were. In 1999 Lawrence proposed {{a model for the}} origin operons. This selfish operon model suggests that individual genes were grouped together by vertical en <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> and were preserved as a single unit because that was beneficial for the genes, not per se for the organism. This model predicts that the gene clusters must have conserved between species. This is not the case for many operons and gene clusters seen in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Genes are {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} basic units transferred through an HGT event. However {{it is also possible}} for HGT to occur within genes. For example, {{it has been shown that}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> between closely related species results in more exchange of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called gene conversion, mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four Escherichia coli and two Shigella flexneri strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain polymorphic sites, consequences of homologous recombination. Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E

2500|$|Bacteria usually acquire {{resistance}} to tetracycline from <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> {{of a gene}} that either encodes an efflux pump or a ribosomal protection protein.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} worrisome {{characteristics}} of P. aeruginosa is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which [...] is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., mexAB, mexXY, etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. In addition to this intrinsic resistance, P. aeruginosa easily develops acquired resistance either by mutation in chromosomally encoded genes or by the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of multidrug resistance by P. aeruginosa isolates requires several different genetic events, including acquisition of different mutations and/or <b>horizontal</b> <b>transfer</b> of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in integrons favors the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some {{recent studies have shown}} phenotypic resistance associated to biofilm formation or to the emergence of small-colony variants may be important in the response of P. aeruginosa populations to antibiotics treatment.|$|E
