25|$|The <b>ginned</b> cotton fibre, {{known as}} lint, is then {{compressed}} into bales which are about 1.5 m tall and weigh almost 220 kg. Only 33% {{of the crop}} is usable lint. Commercial cotton is priced by quality, and that broadly relates to {{the average length of}} the staple, and the variety of the plant. Longer staple cotton (2½ in to 1¼ in) is called Egyptian, medium staple (1¼ in to ¾ in) is called American upland and short staple (less than ¾ in) is called Indian.|$|E
25|$|The {{cottonseed}} {{which remains}} after the cotton is <b>ginned</b> {{is used to}} produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls {{can be added to}} dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.|$|E

The factory also produced almonds and crabwood (Carapa procera).|$|E

Porter seized three hundred bales of Confederate cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it [...] "U.S.N. prize", referring to the United States Navy. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be <b>ginned</b> and baled.

2500|$|Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase had in December {{deployed}} Colonel William H. Reynolds {{to collect}} and sell whatever cotton could be confiscated from the Sea Island plantations. Soon after, Chase deployed Edward Pierce (after his brief period at Grand Contraband Camp) to assess the situation in Port Royal. Pierce found a plantation under strict Army control, paying wages too low to enable economic independence; he also criticized the Army's policy of shipping cotton North to be <b>ginned.</b> Pierce reported that the black workers were experts in cotton farming but required White managers [...] "to enforce a paternal discipline". He recommended {{the establishment of a}} supervised black farming collective to prepare the workers for the responsibilities of citizenship—and to {{serve as a model for}} post-slavery labor relations in the South.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Bara {{women would}} weave local cotton to make {{clothing}} {{for themselves and}} their family members. Cotton continues to be hand picked, <b>ginned</b> and woven using a high-whorl drop spindle. Raw cotton yarn is typically dipped in a softening solution before weaving; prior to softening, the yarn is called fole velo ("living yarn") and is believed to be imbued with magical powers; ombiasy (village wisemen) may tie this yarn around the wrist for protection or wrap it around the bodies of participants in circumcision ceremonies. [...] Less commonly, clothing was made of silk (landy) produced by the local silkworm that fed off indigenous tapia trees growing in the Isalo area. Although this silk was more coarse and uneven than that produced by the Merina or Betsileo people, throughout the island it was the most prized type of silk because of its durability. In the far eastern part of Bara territory, clothing was most commonly made from beaten bark cloth or mats of harefo (Eleocharis plantagines). Women wore tube dresses made of two to three mats stitched together and tied at the shoulder or belted at the waist, often in combination with a bandeau style top of woven mahampy reeds. Men wore beaten bark cloth loincloths with jackets or tunics formed from stitched woven mats; older men's clothing included sleeves. The wearing of charms is common among the Bara, as elsewhere in Madagascar; charms called tsimokotra were historically crafted from the bones of lemurs' feet to relieve fatigue.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gin</b> 4, a Nim 1 -related kinase, is {{required}} in budding yeast for localization of the septins and for proper control of daughter cell growth during G 2 /M. <b>Gin</b> 4 becomes hyperphosphorylated when cells enter mitosis, leading to activation of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity. In this study, we have used immunoaffinity chromatography to identify proteins that associate with <b>Gin</b> 4 during mitosis, {{with the goal of}} finding targets of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity and proteins that play a role in <b>Gin</b> 4 activation. We show that during mitosis <b>Gin</b> 4 is assembled into a multiprotein complex that includes Nap 1, Bni 5, the septins, and at least two molecules of <b>Gin</b> 4. The associated <b>Gin</b> 4 molecules present in this complex phosphorylate each other, leading to <b>Gin</b> 4 hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, the Shs 1 septin present in the complex undergoes <b>Gin</b> 4 -dependent phosphorylation during mitosis and appears to be a substrate of <b>Gin</b> 4 in vitro, suggesting that it is a target of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity in vivo. Genetic data support the idea that Shs 1 is an important target of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity. Association of <b>Gin</b> 4 with the septins during mitosis requires Shs 1, Nap 1, Cla 4, Elm 1, and the kinase activities of <b>Gin</b> 4 and Cdc 28. Self-association of <b>Gin</b> 4 molecules requires Shs 1 but not Cla 4 or Nap 1. Previous work has suggested that the septins function together as a tight complex, and we found {{that the majority of the}} Shs 1 in the cell is tightly bound to the other septins Cdc 3, Cdc 10, Cdc 11, and Cdc 12. Interestingly, however, Shs 1 can bind to <b>Gin</b> 4 and induce <b>Gin</b> 4 oligomerization under conditions in which the Cdc 11 septin does not bind to <b>Gin</b> 4, suggesting that Shs 1 can function independently of the other septins. Taken together, these findings suggest that highly regulated protein-binding events ensure that the <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase is activated only during mitosis and only in association with Shs 1, a likely in vivo substrate of <b>Gin</b> 4. In addition, these results provide clues to how <b>Gin</b> 4 may regulate the localization or function of the septins...|$|R
