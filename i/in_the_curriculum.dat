5|$|An Act of Congress created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E

Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On September 17, 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to look into how the {{individual}} has been portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different <b>curriculums</b> for Swedish compulsory school from the 60 ’s to the 90 ’s. This was done in order to see what type of discourse –monocultural- multicultural- or intercultural- the understanding of the individual has led to. The purpose was divided into five questions: Who is <b>the</b> individual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculums?</b> How is <b>the</b> individual portrayed <b>in</b> relation to education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculums?</b> How is <b>the</b> individual portrayed <b>in</b> relation to society <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculums?</b> What type of discourse - monocultural- multicultural- or intercultural- is mirrored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different <b>curriculums?</b> Is it possible to see tendencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discourses that lead closer to, or farther away from, an intercultural perspective? The material that was analysed consists of four different curriculums: Lgr 62, Lgr 69, Lgr 80, and Lpo 94. The method used was a discourse analytic approach based on the theory of social constructionism. The answers to the questions asked were structured with the support from definitions of monocultural discourse, multicultural discourse, and intercultural discourse, derived from Pirjo Lahdenperäs (2008) descriptions of different organizational cultures. The main conclusion drawn from this analysis {{was the fact that the}} intercultural discourse about the individual has not been obtained. Instead, the monocultural discourse has been dominant for a long time. There have been tendencies showing a move towards a more multicultural-, or intercultural discourse in Lgr 80 and Lpo 94, but these perspectives have not been fully accomplished due to there always existing a cultural norm...|$|R

5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.|$|E
5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E
5|$|In June 1919, {{soon after}} the passage of Education Act 1918, the school {{successfully}} applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions. In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.|$|E
