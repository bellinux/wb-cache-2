40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of {{childbirth}} delivery method on vaginal pressure and abdominal thickness during the Valsalva maneuver (VAL). [Subjects] Thirty healthy female volunteers (26 ‚Äì 39 years of age) were selected for this research. Their delivery histories were: nulliparous 10, vaginal delivery 10, and Cesarean delivery 10. None of the participants had a history of incontinence. [Methods] In the crook-lying position, a perineometer probe was inserted into the vagina and the transducer was placed transversely on the right side of the body during the Valsalva maneuver. [Results] There were significant differences in the thickness of the transverses abdominis (TrA) between in all the <b>groups</b> rest <b>and</b> the Valsalva maneuver, and there were significant differences in the internus oblique (IO) in the nulliparous group. During the Valsalva maneuver, there were sig-nificant differences in the TrA between the nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> there were sig-nificant differences in the IO between the nulliparous delivery <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> between the nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the Cesarean section group.
