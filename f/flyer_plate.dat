The investigation showed that optimal blast mitigation occurs for foams with an expansion ratio of about 60 : 1. Simple analyses representing the foam as a shocked single phase mixture are presented and shown inadequate. The experimental data demonstrate that foam slows down and broadens the propagated pressure disturbance relative to a shock in air.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} have been performed on a built-up cellular steel structure to determine the structural response of the system when subjected to an explosive load at close range. Initial full scale field tests demonstrated how the structure reacted under an extreme loading event; specifically, in {{the failure of the}} bolts and support structure, and the formation of <b>flyer</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>Flyer</b> <b>plates</b> are formed out of the support steel of the structure. They can range in size from several inches square to several feet square {{depending on the size of}} the charge and standoff. These <b>flyer</b> <b>plates,</b> if unimpeded, can travel at extremely high velocities; they will then impact additional steel <b>plates</b> forming secondary <b>flyer</b> <b>plates,</b> which can cause significant damage to the entire structure. Laboratory tests were performed on structural components, plates and bolts, to evaluate their failure mechanisms. Comparisons were made between the type of bolts used and plate thicknesses in developing behavior phenomena. Strain rate data was gathered that can be used to improve existing material behavior. This data reflects overall system behavior as opposed to component behavior. Based on the knowledge gained from these experiments a new retrofit technique was developed that can mitigate damage during an extreme event. The new so-called Kinetic Energy Defeat Device (KEDD) utilizes non-viscous liquids in a periodic array to redirect the kinetic energy of a projectile through the formation of high speed jets. This re-direction of energy can slow the velocity of the incoming projectile, thereby, limiting the damage to the structure. Full scale and scaled field tests, along with laboratory tests have been performed to determine the effectiveness of this device. Tests with and without the KEDD system have been compared evaluating the type of failure that occurs and the speed at which the projectiles trave...|$|R
5000|$|This {{error is}} due to the {{configuration}} exceeding one of the underlying simplifying assumptions used in the Gurney equations, that there is a linear velocity gradient in the explosive product gases.

50|$|The Gurney {{equations}} give {{a result}} that assumes the <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> remains intact throughout its acceleration. For some configurations, this is true; explosive welding, for example, uses a thin sheet of explosive to evenly accelerate flat plates of metal and collide them, and the plates remain solid throughout. However, for many configurations where materials are accelerated outwards, the expanding shell fractures due to stretching. When it fractures, it usually breaks into many small fragments due to the combined effects of ongoing expansion of the shell and stress relief waves moving into the material from fracture points.|$|E

A flyer velocity versus charge voltage calibration up to a charge voltage of 6 kV was performed using a VISAR velocity interferometer.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} study was to drive a planar shock wave into a layer of sand for use in armor effectiveness studies. We proposed to use an explosively-driven <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> to impact the sand layer and launch a shock wave. In detail, our concept is to use a slanted <b>flyer</b> <b>plate,</b> with an explosive layer underneath it, and accelerate the <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> by detonating the explosive. As the resulting detonation wave runs through the explosive layer, it pushes the <b>flyer</b> <b>plate.</b> If all the geometry is carefully designed and the flyer plate/explosive layers are precisely positioned, we will produce a flat <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> that travels on the order of 1 to 2 km/s toward a layer of sand. The subsequent impact will generate a shock wave within the sand that will eventually accelerate the sand with a flat top profile toward the intended target, thus achieving a flat sand-loading profile on the target. Success in these experiments will allow us to be able to test various armor designs for effectiveness in mitigating this threat. Since our experiments are done on a laboratory scale, armor testing can be done in a timely and costeffective manner. Mexican Navy author...|$|E

Recently, underwater explosive welding shows its advantage in some difficult-to-weld combinations such as material with thin thickness, high hardness, and fragile quality.

Mechanical damage to the sample was also characterized using optical and scanning electron microscpopy. Data for this work was obtained from hypervelocity impacts on a polysulfone resin and a graphite polysulfone composite. Polysulfone was selected because it was flown on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) which spent several years in low earth orbit (LEO). Chemistry of the vapor produced by the impact was analyzed {{with a time of}} flight mass spectrometer, (TOFMS). This represents the first time that ejected vapors from hypervelocity collisions were trapped and analyzed with a mass spectrometer. With this approach we are able to study changes in the vapor chemistry as a function of time after impact, obtain a velocity measurement of the vapor, and estimate a temperature of the surface at time of impact using dynamic gas equations. Samples of the vapor plume may be captured and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Studies were also conducted to determine mechanical damage to a graphite polysulfone composite and a polysulfone resin. Impact craters were examined under optical and scanning electron microscopes.

The three-stage gun is a modified two-stage light-gas gun, consisting of a piston used in the first stage, an impactor in the second stage, and a <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> in the third stage. The impactor {{is made up of}} different material layers that are increasing in shock impedance. The graded or pillowed layers allow the flyer to be launched at velocities up to 16 km/s without the formation of a single shock wave in the <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> and without it melting. Under certain experimental conditions the flyer velocity cannot be measured by standard means, X-rays and VISAR. Also, {{there is a need to}} know the flyer velocity prior to a launch in order to calibrate instruments and determine the appropriate shot configuration. The objective of HVL{_}CTH is to produce an accurate forecast of the <b>flyer</b> <b>plate</b> velocity under different launch conditions. CTH is a Eulerian shock physics computational analysis package developed at Sandia National Laboratories. Using CTH requires knowledge of its syntax and capabilities. HVL{_}CTH allows the user to easily interface with CTH, through the use of Fortran programs and batch files, in order to simulate the three-stage launch of a <b>flyer</b> <b>plate.</b> The program, HVL{_}CTH, requires little to no knowledge of the CTH program and greatly reduces the time needed to calculate the flyer velocity.
