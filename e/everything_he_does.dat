The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

500|$|Calling {{the film}} [...] "a slickly {{engaging}} piece of lightweight existentialism," [...] Todd McCarthy wrote in Variety that [...] "Clooney owns {{his role in}} the way first-rate film stars can, so infusing the character with his own persona that <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> seems natural and right. The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis." [...] The New York Times Manohla Dargis especially appreciated the film's strong female roles, noting that [...] "the ferocious Ms. Kendrick, her ponytail swinging like an ax, grabs every scene she's in," [...] but wrote that the film [...] "is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama... and the mope rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses." ...|$|E

He described Holloway as the [...] "X Games-type scientist", {{and said that he}} liked the character's [...] "leap-before-looking" [...] philosophy. He also said that Holloway [...] "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's willing to go to the edge to get that." [...] Describing the character's motivation, he said: [...] "he goes to the extreme in <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the [...] I think what drives him is the thrill of the search." [...] Marshall-Green contrasted Holloway with Shaw, and said: [...] "she's the believer. I'm the scientist. I'm the skeptic. I'm the atheist".|$|E
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the true}} {{identity}} of Archie's killer is kept a secret between Max and Stacey for several months, Max's daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes suspicious in November 2010 when Max tells her Bradley was innocent. Lauren suspects Max killed Archie as she becomes paranoid about his anger. Jossa {{said in an}} interview with website Digital Spy: [...] "'s thinking about Archie's murder and realising that if Bradley didn't do it, it must have been someone else. As far as she knows, her dad is the only person who knows that Bradley didn't do it, so she's trying to put this puzzle together and it's all adding up to Max being the killer, because <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> seems to lead to a lot of aggression." [...] However, Lauren soon works out that Stacey is the murderer after speaking to her. Jossa said she was excited that her character was one of only a select few to know the true identity of Archie's killer.|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E
500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E

He's not doing it because I'm telling him he has to go out, or because he's the face of Michigan State football. When he's out there, he's doing it because he believes in doing it."

2500|$|Coauthor Bill Zanker {{writes in}} the work about the {{importance}} of brand name power for Trump: [...] "That {{is an example of the}} Trump attitude. Trump knows his worth, and he gets people to pay him for it. But it is not only for the money. With Trump it is never just for the money. He is passionate about <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> He loves connecting with people, helping them, and educating them. Zanker gave as an example his company The Learning Annex and its business relationship with Trump, [...] "If you consider the advertising, promotions, and everything The Learning Annex does to enhance the Trump brand, nationally and internationally, Donald gets much more than $1.5 million per speech— but he donates much of the money to charity." [...] Trump concurs with Zanker's assessment, [...] "I give two-hour speeches at the Learning Annex Wealth Expos. I donate a large portion of my speaking fees to charity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Joe's {{place of}} origin is Japan, he spent the {{majority}} of his time in Thailand, where he trained Muay Thai. It was through his victories that Joe got the nickname [...] "Hurricane Upper" [...] Joe Higashi. Joe earned his title as the champion of Muay Thai by beating Hwa Jai in a Muay Thai only tournament. Hwa Jai later joined the King of Fighters tournament in order to exact revenge against Joe but failed, and after admitting his defeat they're good friends and sparring partners. Ever since then, Joe has been defending his title against lesser opponents. At first, Joe was a stoic character who lived for fighting and training. As time passed, he becomes a pretty goofy man who self proclaims himself to be a genius with mostly <b>everything.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not take battle as serious as the Bogards, but he loves to fight.

2500|$|He appeared, from 1984 until 1989, {{with the}} New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (NYGASP), earning warm reviews for his [...] "subtle facial gesture and small comic touch" [...] and clear diction. [...] Of his 1986 Bunthorne with the company, The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Reed does not overdo. He sings and {{speaks in a}} {{moderate}} tone of voice, never moves more than fairly quickly, and never hits the audience {{over the head with}} a joke. As a result, when he strikes a pose of even mild ridiculousness, the result is hilarity. He makes Bunthorne a good-natured poseur, and admits his dependency on adulation with endearing simplicity." [...] At a NYGASP gala at Symphony Space in 1987, Reed proposed on stage to noted sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer. [...] He also performed in concerts in North America and Britain, including at The Berkshire Choral Institute as The Duke of Plaza Toro (with Kenneth Sandford as Don Alhambra) in The Gondoliers (1985). [...] In reviewing a 1988 concert, The Boston Globe wrote that Reed [...] "is near to perfect in his chosen field. Reed's acting, his command of patter and <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> (which is a lot) to convince you that what he's emitting could really be mellifluous, all-out singing – all these are freshly and tirelessly amusing".|$|E

Ron Entwistle is co-writer and co-producer of [...] "Weird", which Duff said is [...] "about someone that she's still obsessed with. And <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> is like he says this, but he does this ... She's not really sure who he is or what he does, but she likes it." [...] Kevin De Clue contributed to [...] "The Last Song" [...] and [...] "Mr. James Dean" [...] (both co-produced by Haylie), which Duff has named her favorite track on the album and described as [...] "very funny"; in the song, she tells an ex-boyfriend that he'll [...] "never be James Dean". Duff neither confirmed nor denied whether the song was about fellow singer Aaron Carter, and she said [...] "it was definitely an experience that I went through that was interesting and I {{learned a lot from}} that time in my life." [...] In [...] "Hide Away", co-produced and co-written by Shaun Shankel, Duff discusses a relationship that isn't working because she is in a position where her life is [...] "figuratively under the microscope". Diane Warren wrote [...] "I Am", an empowerment song in which Duff lists positive and negative aspects about herself; she has said it is about being comfortable [...] "with all those feelings ... being who you are".

2500|$|Antoine Roquentin – The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a café owner named Françoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Françoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." [...] He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." [...] When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E
