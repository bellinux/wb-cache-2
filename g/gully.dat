5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree <b>Gully</b> Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water <b>Gully</b> adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water <b>Gully</b> were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree <b>Gully.</b> A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} the <b>gully</b> in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Waterfall <b>Gully</b> {{was first}} {{explored}} by European {{settlers in the}} early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall <b>Gully</b> until 1884, when they agreed to place the land {{under the auspices of}} the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall <b>Gully,</b> designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State Government control, and in 1972 the Waterfall <b>Gully</b> Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on The <b>Gully,</b> Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade.

40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>gullies</b> {{and their}} relationships to the atmospherically derived dust–ice mantle and aeolian {{features in the}} northwestern part of the Argyre basin. A detailed morphologic map of the Argyre study region allowed us to constrain the stratigraphic relationships and relative ages of <b>gullies.</b> In addition, we investigated the morphologic characteristics and orientations of all <b>gullies</b> in the Argyre study region. Maximum absolute ages for <b>gullies</b> were determined with crater size–frequency distribution measurements of the dust–ice mantle, which is the source material of <b>gullies</b> in the study area. <b>Gullies</b> only evolve from this mantle probably by melting of its ice content. Two different morphologies of pristine and degraded <b>gullies</b> were identified, mostly occurring on pole- and equatorward-facing slopes, respectively. We conclude that the morphologies and orientations were initiated either by a more rapid and extensive erosion of equatorward-facing <b>gullies</b> or by at least two generations of <b>gullies</b> with generally older <b>gullies</b> on equatorward-facing slopes and younger ones on pole-facing slopes. Different intensities of solar insolation on equator- and pole-facing slopes might {{be responsible for the}} different development of pristine and degraded <b>gullies.</b> <b>Gullies</b> in the study area generally have ages ≲ 20 Ma. Some uncratered (and thus very young) aeolian dunes are superposed by a few <b>gullies</b> in some locations, indicating another even younger generation of <b>gullies</b> with an upper limit absolute model age of about < 500 ka...|$|R

40|$|Received: 2013 / 10 / 10 - Accepted: 2013 / 12 / 13) This article {{presents}} {{the process of}} development of seven <b>gullies.</b> The area of study {{is located in the}} province of Pichincha. These <b>gullies</b> show extensive sedimentary deposits. The characteristic of the deposits, th stratification and analysis of the organic matter at different depths, demonstrate that the deposits were formed by the accumulation in the <b>gullies.</b> At a depth of 225 - 230 cm the deposits have higher organic matter content than the layers located more than a meter above. The influences of the deposits, the transformation of the forms of the <b>gullies</b> and the characteristics of erosive-accumulative process have been investigated. Also the characteristics of the <b>gullies</b> at multiple levels have been studied. The <b>gullies</b> that are {{at the top of the}} hillside belong to periods prior to the activation of the erosion, if compared to <b>gullies</b> in the lower parts of mountainside.

40|$|Monitoring ephemeral <b>gullies</b> {{facilitates}} water {{planning and}} soil conservation. Artificial interpretation based on high spatial resolution images {{is the main}} method for monitoring ephemeral <b>gullies</b> in large areas; however, this method is time consuming. In this study, a semiautomatic method for extracting ephemeral <b>gullies</b> in loess hilly areas based on directional edge detection is proposed. First, the area where ephemeral <b>gullies</b> developed was extracted because the weak trace of ephemeral <b>gullies</b> in images can hardly be detected by most image detectors, which avoided the noise from other large <b>gullies.</b> Second, a Canny edge detector was employed to extract all edges in the image. Then, those edges along the direction where ephemeral <b>gullies</b> developed were searched and coded as candidate ephemeral <b>gullies.</b> Finally, the ephemeral <b>gullies</b> were identified through filtering of pseudo-gullies by setting the appropriate length threshold. Experiments in three loess hilly areas showed that accuracy ranged from 38. 18 % to 85. 05 %, completeness ranged from 82. 35 % to 92. 86 %, and quality ranged from 35. 29 % to 79. 82 %. The quality of the remote sensing images highly affected the results. The accuracy was significantly improved when the image was used with less grass and shrubs. The length threshold in directional searching also affected the accuracy. A small threshold resulted in additional noise and disconnected <b>gullies,</b> whereas a large threshold disregarded the short <b>gullies.</b> A reasonable threshold can be obtained through the index of quality. The threshold also exhibits a strong relationship with {{the average length of}} ephemeral <b>gullies,</b> and this relationship can help obtain the optimum threshold in the hilly area of the Northern Loess Plateau of China...|$|R
40|$|The {{finding of}} abundant, {{apparently}} young, Martian <b>gullies</b> with morphologies indicative of formation by flowing fluid was surprising in that volumes of near-surface liquid water in sufficient quantities {{to modify the}} surface geology were not thought possible under current conditions. Original hypotheses on origin of <b>gullies</b> were mostly centered on groundwater seepage and surface runoff and melting of near-surface ground ice. More recently, melting of snow deposited in periods of higher obliquity has been proposed as a possible origin of the <b>gullies.</b> Tied to this hypothesis is the supposition that the "pasted-on" mantling unit observed in association with many <b>gullies</b> is composed of remnant snowpack. The mantling unit has distinct rounded edge on its upper boundary and exhibits features suggestive of flow noted that the uppermost part of the mantle marks where <b>gullies</b> begin, suggesting {{that the source of}} water for the <b>gullies</b> was within the mantle. The mantle is found preferentially on cold, pole-facing slopes and, where mantled and non-mantled slopes are found together, <b>gullies</b> are observed incised into the latter. In other cases, the mantling material lacks <b>gullies...</b>|$|R
5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the {{alternative}} route along the <b>gully</b> was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire {{from some of the}} landowners for improved access to and from their propertiesespecially from the Mügge familyled to pressure to build a road through the <b>gully.</b> Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall <b>Gully</b> road was built in the late 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some parts}} of Waterfall <b>Gully</b> were {{transferred}} from the District Council of East Torrens (now the Adelaide Hills Council) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established, {{the government of the}} day chose to retain control of a significant portion of Waterfall <b>Gully.</b> Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G.
