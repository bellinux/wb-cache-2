5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they could continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer come to Washington, D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E

5|$|One year later, Crash {{is living}} with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island, one of the islands owned by Cortex in the {{previous}} game. After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he may contain it. After retrieving a gem, Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E

5|$|The Dude {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> his goons could {{look for the}} ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests being a father, but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E
5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of regent (officially known as General-in-Chief 大將軍) was created during Emperor Wu's reign (r. 14187 BCE) when he appointed three officials {{to form a}} triumvirate regency over the central government while the child Emperor Zhao (r. 8774 BCE) sat on the throne. Regents were often relatives-in-law to the emperor through his empress's family, but they could also be men of lowly means who depended on the emperor's favor to advance their position at court. Eunuchs who maintained the harem of the palace could also gain a similar level of power. They often came from {{the middle class and}} had links to trade. In the Western Han, there are only a handful of examples where eunuchs rose to power since the official bureaucracy was strong enough to suppress them. After the eunuch Shi Xian (石顯) became the Prefect of the Palace Masters of Writing (中尚書), Emperor Yuan (r. 4833 BCE) relinquished much of his authority to <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he was allowed to make vital policy decisions and was respected by officials. However, Shi Xian was expelled from office once Emperor Cheng (337 BCE) took the throne. No palace eunuch would obtain comparable authority again until after 92 CE, when the eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong (d. 107 CE) sided with Emperor He (r. 88105 CE) in a coup to overthrow the Dou 竇 clan of the empress dowager. Officials complained when eunuchs like Sun Cheng (d. 132 CE) were awarded by Emperor Shun (r. 125144 CE) with marquessates, yet after the year 135 CE the eunuchs were given legal authority to pass on fiefs to adopted sons. Although Emperor Ling (r. 168189 CE) relinquished a great deal of authority to eunuchs Zhao Zhong (d. 189 CE) and Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE), the eunuchs were slaughtered in 189 CE when Yuan Shao (d. 202 CE) besieged and stormed the palaces of Luoyang.|$|E

5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1957, Great Moments in Aviation follows Gabriel Angel (Rakie Ayola), a young Caribbean {{woman from}} Grenada who embarks {{on a cruise}} to England with the {{intention}} of becoming an aviator. Upon boarding the ship, Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart (Jonathan Pryce). The rest of the ship's passengers, including missionaries Angela Bead (Vanessa Redgrave) and Gwendolyne Quim (Dorothy Tutin) assume the two are married, and when Professor Rex Goodyear (John Hurt) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch, Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover. It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death. She is furious with Duncan for lying to her, but the two go on to reconcile and later make love. Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to have a husband waiting for her in England. She explains that he has been there for two years working, and she is joining <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas (Oliver Samuels) who flew off into a storm and never came home. They begin a relationship nonetheless, supported by Angela and Gwendolyne, who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another. They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years, and become lovers, vowing to live together in their retirement. It comes to light that the death of Goodyear's wife was an accident, caused as he and Duncan fought over her. Duncan returns his painting, and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel. She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over, and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together. The film ends with Gabriel's grandmother Vesuvia (Carmen Munroe) reading her family a letter from England, informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together, and are expecting a child. As the family express their delight, Gabriel flies overhead, having finally attained her pilot licence and become an aviator.|$|E
