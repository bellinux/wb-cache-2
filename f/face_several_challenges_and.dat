In this paper we {{argue that it is}} necessary to distinguish between two kinds of barriers to innovation. The first corresponds to what we describe as revealed barriers and reflects the degree of difficulty of the innovation process and the learning experience consequent on the firm engaging in innovation activity. The second type of impediment, which we label deterring barriers, encompasses the obstacles that prevent firms from committing to innovation. We use data from the 4 th UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS 4) to investigate the relationship between firms' engagement in innovation and their assessment of the barriers to innovation. We show that the relationship is curvilinear in the case of costs and market barriers. These results have important implications for innovation policy and innovation management. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is {{a system}} that allows for direct {{communication}} between the brain and an external device. Originally, the motivation for developing BCIs has been to provide severely disabled individuals with a basic communication system. Recent years, BCIs directed at regular consumers in practical control applications have gained popularity as well, for which the ultimate goal is to provide a more natural way of communicating with machines. However, BCIs intended at use in control systems <b>face</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> are still inferior to conventional controllers in terms of usability, reliability and practical value. In this thesis, we explore two novel concepts that can enforce BCIs. The first concept relies on detection of so-called Error-Related Potentials (ErrPs), which are the response in brainwaves to an erroneous event. We argue for that these potentials can serve as reward-based signals that give feedback to the system, which enables the BCI to adapt to the user. The second concept is to use sequence labeling frameworks based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to translate brainwaves into control signals with greater accuracy. We also suggest how these two concepts can be combined. Our experiments to detect ErrPs in BCI control applications using a consumer grade headset to obtain EEG measurements indicate no presence of ErrPs, however, the reliability of the EEG recordings is questionable. Furthermore, we have developed a new implementation of the so-called Sparse Hidden-Dynamic CRF (SHDCRF) and measure its performance on a common BCI classification task. In our experiment, the model outperforms similar classifiers that represent the state-of-the-art, and the results suggest that the proposed model is superior in terms of accuracy and modeling capacity. </p...|$|E

It is clear that cloud technologies have proven a major commercial success over recent years (since the appearance of products and cloud offerings like Amazon EC 2 and Microsoft Azure). According to Gardner, Cloud Computing will play a large part in the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) domain over the next 10 years or more, since it provides cost-savings to enterprises thanks to virtualization technologies, opening gates for new business opportunities as well.

40|$|Current {{societies}} <b>face</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> it {{has been}} indicated that sustainability is a major problem. It appears vital to possess knowledge on how to govern problems associated with sustainable development in order to mitigate the challenges they bring about. In this frame of reference, sustainable consumption appears imperative for reaching sustainability. In accord, this dissertation elaborates on how consumption is governed {{by a variety of}} instances and hence contributes to consumer studies by progressing consumer policy as well as the everyday life of consumers in offering distinctive perspectives on governing consumption. Consumer policy attempts to govern consumption, however, predominantly focuses on market activities instead of everyday consumption. Respectively, consumption is here understood as everyday conduct in social practices so as to shed light on its routine and mundane character. The idea of government deployed in this dissertation is that of executing power over oneself or others in conduct of conduct. Hence it is possible to speak of the government of states, households, consumers, or the self. Regimes of prac tices governing consumption can then be found beyond and along the political and market spheres in the everyday. The idea of sustainable development pertains to political practices as well as to everyday routines governing consumption. In order to govern consumption towards a more sustainable form of conduct, practitioners in political, market and everyday spheres can be considered by an analytics of government. Thereby a nexus concatenating distinct features can be distinguished including modes of thought, technologies of government, visual representations and identities involved in government. These four features are considered in the analysis of the individual articles providing perspectives on how consumption is governed. On the one hand consumer policy is comparatively analysed considering first the historic development of consumer empowerment and second on the discursive construction of the consumer in policy documents. The other perspectives on governing consumption convey examples drawing on food consumption. First, a practice approach highlights routines governing consumption, and second, a policy intervention related to public catering is analysed. The results highlight the importance of a possible politico-theoretical alignment of the four features of an analytics of government by the respective practitioners in political, market and everyday spheres. The interplay between modes of thought, technologies of government, visual representations and identities plays a vital role in governing consumption. In order to achieve sustainability and especially sustainable consumption it has to be acknowledged that these four features mutually interact and influence each another...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} ability of two {{theoretical}} frameworks {{to account for the}} establishment of an R&D center in China by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. Multinational corporations <b>face</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> dilemmas when offshoring R&D activities. Barriers created by distance can easily result in increased cost and risk, and have cultural and economic effects. The establishment of the R&D centre in China by Novo Nordisk is well accounted for by the OLI framework. The interaction of ownership, locational, and internalisation factors in the OLI framework reflect the motivations for Novo Nordisk in establishing a wholly-owned R&D subsidiary in China. In contrast, Novo Nordisk’s actions do not fit into the additional domains added in the OLMA framework (a recent revision of OLI), notably the mode of entry choice and adjustment factors. The interaction of the ownership, location, mode of entry and adjustment factors in the OLMA framework does not reflect Novo Nordisk’s actions, and in particular the M and A factors are not utilised. The R&D literature supports the exploitation of the M and A factors, and by ignoring those factors multinational corporations might limit their performance. Not evaluating which entry mode would be most beneficial, and not acknowledging the necessity of adjustments as the structural complexity and the scope of operations increase, might result in poorer business outcomes. It can therefore be argued that Novo Nordisk is failing to optimise the performance of its R&D function by not utilising the M and A factors of the updated version of the OLI framework.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} as a cost effective and easy to deploy alternative to traditional wired systems in a multitude of application scenarios ranging from industrial automation to healthcare monitoring. They are expected to enable an unparalleled number of new services that will bring countless benefits to society. However, low power communications of sensor nodes operating in unlicensed bands <b>face</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> are easily corrupted by transmissions of other collocated wireless networks. This problem has recently raised reliability concerns which have been tremendously enhanced by the proliferation of wireless devices we have been witnessing during the last years in the few available regions of the spectrum. This dissertation studies how to achieve reliable communications by proposing different ways for the energy aware management of the radio interference problem. The use of wireless sensing technologies has been envisaged in a broad variety of settings: for this reason {{it is not possible}} to identify a unifying solution for the problem of interference, but rather it is necessary to tailor the design of communication schemes accounting for the specific communication paradigm adopted by sensors, the traffic pattern generated by the expected application, as well as for the channel conditions experienced by nodes. When packet transmissions are addressed to a single receiver, cognitive access schemes can be utilized and sensors can opportunistically select for their transmissions when to access a certain channel or which channel to access so as to avoid interference. We provide an energy aware design for communication schemes implementing these ideas and evaluate their energy performance by means of experiments using real hardware. Our results indicate that the first approach should be considered only for sporadic packet transmissions over channels presenting limited interfering activities; channel adaptation should instead be preferred for large bulks of data or when the risk of operating in heavily interfered frequency bands is high. We further propose and evaluate a novel adaptive frequency hopping algorithm: this algorithm has been shown to be very efficient in mitigating the negative effects of interference allowing at the same time to avoid the use of the energy costly spectrum sensing algorithms required by cognitive access schemes. However, none of these three approaches may be suitable for scenarios where packet transmissions are addressed to multiple receivers. To deal with the packet losses that nodes may experience over noisy or interfered channels we envisage the use of fountain codes and show how it is possible to engineer such a coding solution so as to reduce the complexity and overhead introduced by the encoding and decoding procedures. The resulting codes provide an efficient way for disseminating data over multi-hop wireless sensor networks. Results obtained in this dissertation can be of great utility for designers of sensor applications who can use them in order to select the most energy efficient way to achieve reliable interference-aware communications.

Based on the platinum cost per kW of the fuel cell, two different scenarios (32 and 3 US$ kW(- 1)) are considered. It is observed that in spite of very high cost of platinum, the net present value of the fuel cell is comparable with the scenario with low investment cost in platinum when the salvage value of platinum is considered. In some situations, the high investment cost in the platinum offers high salvage value leading to a profitable case. Hence, the high cost of platinum might promote the commercialization of the fuel cells if appropriate business model is in place...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} our inaugural {{effort to}} develop a law clinic serving the unique client population in Okinawa, Japan. Due to a substantial U. S. military presence in Okinawa, there is a heavy concentration of foreign residents here including U. S. civilians and service members and non affiliated third country nationals, especially from the Philippines, Korea and Thailand. The Japanese immigration status of foreigners [...] either Status of Forces Agreement ("SOFA") status or Japanese resident aliens, complicates the legal landscape and affects their legal rights and responsibilities. Additionally, the large presence of foreigners on this small island, and their interaction with local residents, creates a host of complex legal issues that elsewhere would be rare but are the norm here. While most foreign residents are transient, their international legal issues are not people change, problems remain. Currently, no legal providers in Okinawa comprehensively serve Japanese and non Japanese nationals with their international legal problems. With emphasis on international family law cases, we attempted to provide bilegal, bilingual counseling for all Okinawan residents in our law school clinic last year. We <b>faced</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> we have much work ahead. But, we will reflect on our experiences, continue to develop the clinic and break through barriers {{in order to provide}} high quality legal advice to needy clients...|$|R
30|$|The {{contemporary}} {{humanitarian and}} disaster management field <b>faces</b> <b>several</b> interrelated <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> problems which make study on {{coordination and cooperation}} vital to save as many lives as possible and to lessen impacts. To begin with, {{there is a growing}} trend in the number and scale of disasters (UNISDR 2015; Cahill 2012), including that of climate-related and man-made disasters. During the first decade of this century alone, 4000 disasters occurred, significantly jumping from the 900 disasters during the 1970 s (Brinkman 2010). In particular, the mortality and economic losses associated with disaster risks in low- and middle-income countries are an uptrend, with the average of economic losses from disasters reaching an average of US$ 250 billion to US$ 300 billion each year (UNISDR 2015).|$|R
40|$|Post-disaster housing {{reconstruction}} projects <b>face</b> <b>several</b> <b>challenges.</b> Resources <b>and</b> material {{supplies are}} often scarce; several and {{different types of}} organizations are involved, while projects must be completed {{as quickly as possible}} to foster recovery. Within this context, the chapter aims to increase the understanding of relief supply chain design in reconstruction. In addition, the chapter is introducing a community based and beneficiary perspective to relief supply chains by evaluating the implications of local components for supply chain design in reconstruction. This is achieved through the means of secondary data analysis based on the evaluation reports of two major housing reconstruction projects that took place in Europe the last decade. A comparative analysis of the organizational designs of these projects highlights the ways in which users can be involved. The performance of reconstruction supply chains seems to depend to a large extent on the way beneficiaries are integrated in supply chain design impacting positively on the effectiveness of reconstruction supply chains...|$|R

Global and inter-regional competitio, a heterogeneous and discerning visitor, and tensions between heritage preservation and "edutainment", have together demanded a more creative use of historic venues and sites and their promotion to new audiences. The paper outlines responses {{in the form of}} late night and nuite blanche events and festivals, which are extending the heritage tourism offer temporally, spatially and socially in a growing number of cities. At the same time, this late night events strategy is making areas of these cities both safer and more attractive to visitors...|$|R

Methods We used the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from 1990 to 2015. Results Ischemic heart disease was {{the leading cause of}} death in the region in 2015, followed by cerebrovascular disease. Changes in total deaths ranged from a reduction of 25 % for diarrheal diseases to an increase of about 42 % for diabetes and tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer. Collective violence and legal intervention increased by 850 % during the time period. Diet was the leading risk factor for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for men compared to maternal malnutrition for females. Childhood undernutrition was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 1990 and 2005, but the second in 2015 after high blood pressure. Conclusions Our study shows that the region is <b>facing</b> <b>several</b> health <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> calls for global efforts to stabilise the region and to address the current and future burden of disease...|$|R
