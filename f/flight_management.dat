5|$|Westland and IBM {{formed a}} {{consortium}} in 1991 {{to perform the}} helicopter's complex systems integration. The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake {{a wide variety of}} missions. A digital automatic flight control system (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>management</b> systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the System Dynamics methods and the existing knowledge and practices for the development <b>Management</b> <b>Flight</b> Simulators. <b>Management</b> <b>Flight</b> Simulators constitute the ultimate cybernetic method for learning and testing strategies prior to implementation. The main issues and trends in the field are identified, and new views to the development of System Dynamics simulation models are suggested. Having gone through a review process of relevant sources, a conceptual framework for the development of System Dynamics <b>Management</b> <b>Flight</b> Simulators is proposed. The proposed framework would be particularly useful for researchers in the field but also for practitioners and developers of decision support systems.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, <b>flight</b> <b>management</b> systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E

25|$|Cali's {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} had no functional radar to monitor the 757, {{as it had been}} blown up in 1992 by the terror group FARC. Cali's approach uses several radio beacons to guide pilots around the mountains and canyons that surround the city.

25|$|Some airliners are {{flown by}} a third crew member in {{addition}} to the pilot and co-pilot, a flight engineer. The flight engineer is responsible for monitoring aircraft systems in flight and for inspecting the aircraft before and after each flight.

Recent airliners from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus are designed for a two pilot crew with <b>flight</b> <b>management</b> functions previously the responsibility of a flight engineer now handled by automation.
