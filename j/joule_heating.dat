5|$|The {{resistive}} <b>Joule</b> <b>heating</b> effect {{employed in}} filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as <b>Joule</b> <b>heating.</b> This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA uniform {{electric}} current at infinity {{was applied to}} a thin infinite conductor containing an elliptical hole with an edge crack. The {{electric current}} gives rise to two states, i. e., uniform and uneven <b>Joule</b> <b>heat.</b> These two states must be considered to analyze the heat conduction problem. The uneven <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> gives rise to uneven temperature and thus to heat flux, and to thermal stress. Using a rational mapping function, problems of the electric current, the <b>Joule</b> <b>heat,</b> the temperature, the heat flux, the thermal stress are analyzed, and each of their solutions is obtained as a closed form. The distributions of the electric current, the <b>Joule</b> <b>heat,</b> the temperature, the heat flux and the stress are shown in figures. The heat conduction problem is solved as a temperature boundary value problem. Solving the thermal stress problem, dislocation and rotation terms appear, which complicates this problem. The solutions of the <b>Joule</b> <b>heat,</b> the temperature, the heat flux and the thermal stress are nonlinear {{in the direction of}} the electric current. The crack problems are also analyzed, and the singular intensities at the crack tip of each problem are obtained. Mode II (sliding mode) stress intensity factor (SIF) is produced as well as Mode I (opening mode) SIF, for any direction of the electric current. The relations between the electric current density and the melting temperature and between the electric current density and SIF are investigated for some crack lengths in an aluminum plate...|$|R
25|$|Resistors (and other {{elements}} with resistance) oppose {{the flow of}} electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance.

25|$|Irreversible {{degradation}} of a photoresistor can be induced by exceeding its maximum specified voltage {{even for a}} short period. For high-resistivity devices, this voltage {{is determined by the}} leakage currents flowing on the semiconductor surface and varies between 100 and 300 V for. For low-resistivity models, the voltage limit is lower and originates from the <b>Joule</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electromagnetic waves {{which have}} a {{component}} of their electric fields aligned parallel to the wires will induce the movement of electrons {{along the length of}} the wires. Since the electrons are free to move in this direction, the polarizer behaves in a similar manner to the surface of a metal when reflecting light, and the wave is reflected backwards along the incident beam (minus a small amount of energy lost to <b>Joule</b> <b>heating</b> of the wire).|$|E
40|$|Poynting flux {{into the}} {{ionosphere}} measures the electromagnetic energy {{coming from the}} magnetosphere. This energy flux can vary greatly between quiet times and geomagnetic active times. As part of the Geospace Environment Modeling-coupling energetics and dynamics of atmospheric regions modeling challenge, physics-based models of the 3 -D ionosphere and ionospheric electrodynamics solvers of magnetosphere models that specify <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> and empirical models specifying Poynting flux were run for six geomagnetic storm events of varying intensity. We compared model results with Poynting flux values along the DMSP- 15 satellite track computed from ion drift meter and magnetic field observations. Although being a different quantity, <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> can in practice be correlated to incoming Poynting flux because the energy is dissipated primarily in high latitudes where Poynting flux is being deposited. Within the physics-based model group, we find mixed results with some models overestimating <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> and some models agreeing better with observed Poynting flux rates as integrated over auroral passes. In contrast, empirical models tend to underestimate integrated Poynting flux values. Modeled <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> or Poynting flux patterns often resemble the observed Poynting flux patterns on a large scale, but amplitudes can differ {{by a factor of}} 2 or larger due to the highly localized nature of observed Poynting flux deposition that is not captured by the models. In addition, the positioning of modeled patterns appear to be randomly shifted against the observed Poynting flux energy input. This study is the first to compare Poynting flux and <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> in a large variety of models of the ionosphere...|$|R

25|$|In {{a normal}} conductor, an {{electric}} current may be visualized as a fluid of electrons moving across a heavy ionic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision {{some of the}} energy carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into heat, which is essentially the vibrational kinetic energy of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and <b>Joule</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
25|$|Induction heating is a {{non-contact}} {{process which}} uses {{the principle of}} electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece. By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current is made to flow in the material, thereby causing <b>Joule</b> <b>heating.</b> In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the Curie point due to hysteresis losses. The generated current is predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by {{the frequency of the}} alternating field and the permeability of the material.|$|E
25|$|Superconductors are {{materials}} that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, {{because they can}} have V=0 and I≠0. This also means there is no <b>joule</b> <b>heating,</b> or in other words no dissipation of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4 K with liquid helium for most metallic superconductors like NbSn alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77K with liquid nitrogen for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic high temperature superconductors.|$|E

It is found that the conductive filament rupture in RRAM RESET process can be attributed {{not only to the}} <b>Joule</b> <b>heat</b> generated by internal current flow through a filament but also to the charge trap/detrapping effect. The RESET current decreases upon heating. Meanwhile, the energy consumption also decreases exponentially.

25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and thermistors {{are generally}} used in two ways.

25|$|More {{rarely a}} {{defect in the}} magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that {{particular}} spot is subject to rapid <b>Joule</b> <b>heating</b> from the enormous current, which raises {{the temperature of the}} surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size of}} the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.|$|E

500|$|Io has an {{extremely}} thin atmosphere consisting mainly {{of sulfur dioxide}} (...) , with minor constituents including sulfur monoxide (...) , sodium chloride (...) , and atomic sulfur and oxygen. The atmosphere has significant variations in density and temperature with time of day, latitude, volcanic activity, and surface frost abundance. The maximum atmospheric pressure on Io ranges from 3.3 to 3 pascals (Pa) or 0.3 to 3 nbar, spatially seen on Io's anti-Jupiter hemisphere and along the equator, and temporally {{in the early afternoon}} when the temperature of surface frost peaks. Localized peaks at volcanic plumes have also been seen, with pressures of 5 to 40  Pa (5 to 40 nbar). Io's atmospheric pressure is lowest on Io's night side, where the pressure dips to 0.1 to 1 Pa (0.0001 to 0.001 nbar). Io's atmospheric temperature ranges from the temperature of the surface at low altitudes, where sulfur dioxide is in vapor pressure equilibrium with frost on the surface, to 1800 K at higher altitudes where the lower atmospheric density permits heating from plasma in the Io plasma torus and from <b>Joule</b> <b>heating</b> from the Io flux tube. The low pressure limits the atmosphere's effect on the surface, except for temporarily redistributing sulfur dioxide from frost-rich to frost-poor areas, and to expand the size of plume deposit rings when plume material re-enters the thicker dayside atmosphere. The thin Ionian atmosphere also means any future landing probes sent to investigate Io will not need to be encased in an aeroshell-style heatshield, but instead require retrothrusters for a soft landing. The thin atmosphere also necessitates a rugged lander capable of enduring the strong Jovian radiation, which a thicker atmosphere would attenuate.|$|E

When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law).
