40|$|Global {{warming and}} air {{pollution}} are the major problems facing the world today. Therefore strict environmental legislation on the emission of harmful gases from motor vehicles has forced the automobile industry to search for alternative materials or new materials for exhaust systems. In order to produce cleaner exhaust gases, the exhaust temperature needs to be increased to approximately 900 oC. Therefore, exhaust manifolds are exposed repeatedly to hot gases as they are nearest to the engine requiring good oxidation resistance, thermal fatigue properties, cold workability and weldability. One such material to meet the above characteristics is AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel, a dual stabilised Ti and Nb ferritic stainless steel. Ti and Nb are added to stainless steel to stabilise C and N due to their high tendency to form carbonitrides (Ti,Nb) (C,N) and laves phase (Fe 2 Nb) and Fe 3 Nb 3 C. With 18 % Cr content, this steel has a good corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. Included in many applications of this steel are those requiring deep drawing and related forming operations. However, the drawability and stretchability of ferritic stainless steels is inferior {{to that of the}} more expensive austenitic stainless steels. For instance, Columbus Stainless has experienced ridging/roping problems at times during the manufacturing process of type AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel. It is believed that this problem is related to crystallographic texture of materials which have effect on formability. The R-value in FSS can be improved through optimisation of chemical composition, which includes reducing the carbon content, and processing conditions such as reducing the slab reheating temperature, increasing annealing temperature and refining the hot band grain size. Therefore the aim of this research project was firstly to investigate effect of amount of cold reduction and annealing temperature on texture evolution and its influence on formability. The as received 4. 5 mm hot band steel was cold rolled by 62, 78 and 82 % reductions respectively followed by isothermal annealing of each at 900 oC, 950 oC and 1025 oC for 3 minutes. Orientation distribution function (ODF) through X-ray diffractometer (XRD) measurement was used to characterise the crystallographic texture formed in the steel using PANanalytical X’Pert PRO diffractrometer with X’celerator detector and variable divergence. Microstructures were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that steels that received 78 % cold reduction and annealed at 1025 oC recorded the highest Rm-value and lowest ΔR-value which enhances its <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>capability.</b> In addition, this steel showed the highest intensity of shifted γ-fibre, notably { 554 } and { 334 }. It can therefore be concluded that the γ-fibre which favours deep drawing, is optimal after 78 % cold reduction and annealing at 1025 oC. The second objective was to investigate the effect of (Nb+Ti) content on the crystallographic texture and the subsequent formability and ridging severity. AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel with different amount of (Nb+Ti) content was used i. e. Steel A (0. 26 Nb+ 0. 2 Ti), Steel B (0. 44 Nb+ 0. 15 Ti) and steel C (0. 7 Nb+ 0. 32 Ti). After a strain of 10 %, steels A exhibited the least resistance against surface ridging with average roughness Ra of 1. 5 μm followed by steels B with an average roughness Ra of 1. 1 μm. Steel C showed the highest resistance to ridging with an average roughness Ra of 0. 64 μm. This was attributed to the increase in carbonitrites (NbTi) (C,N) due to increased (Nb+Ti) content which acted as nucleation sites for γ-fibre.

40|$|Interstitial Free (IF) steels have {{excellent}} <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>capabilities</b> and non-ageing properties. These steel grades {{still have some}} disadvantages such as a generally weak mechanical strength and high reactivity in the grain boundaries during galvannealing, which produces brittle Fe-Zn-intermetallic compounds. Furthermore the resistance to secondary work embrittlement is rather low due {{to the absence of}} soluble interstitials in grain boundaries. A good remedy is the insertion of a defined amount of carbon into the surface after recrystallization started. The possibilities and limits of a change in surface properties of Ti-IF sheet steel by a short time annealing in reactive atmospheres (CO, H 2, N 2) were evaluated: The introduction of carbon interstitials during continuous annealing increases mechanical strength associated with bake hardening and moderate age hardening and a good formability. However, to achieve fully recrystallized grains with a favourable (111) -texture the carburizing treatment should start after new grains have nucleated. A short carburizing treatment during continuous annealing can significantly improve the resistance of Ti-IF and P-Ti/Nb-IF steel against secondary work embrittlement (SWE). The r-value was slightly influenced by the added carbon atoms, the r-values were in the range between 3 and 2. The higher the carbon potential of a carburizing atmosphere, the higher is the carbon pickup. This could lead to the formation of an austenite layer which has a much higher solubility for carbon than the ferrite...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{simplified}} (one step) method called “inverse approach ” (IA) for {{the numerical}} analysis of the stamping process has been continuously developed by the authors {{since the end of}} the eighties. In the present paper we recall the main finite element formulation aspects, for an efficient estimation of the large elastoplastic strains encountered in <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> operations. The <b>capabilities</b> of the code Fast_Stamp include: fixed (imposed) initial blank, bending effects due to tool curvatures, blankholder restraining forces (including drawbeads). Considerations of bending and unbending during forming stages can improve the IA regarding stresses distribution. In this case satisfactory estimation of springback can result. Since 1996 we also developed “math based ” optimization algorithms and strategies. The cost functions and constraints are mainly expressed to reduce or control the thickness changes, the localized necking, the wrinkling tendency, the springback after forming. The design variables are describing the shape of the blank, the additional (addendum) surfaces, the restraining forces due to drawbeads and the material properties such as anisotropy coefficient and hardening exponent. Optimization algorithms are mainly based on surface response techniques with moving least square approximation and SQP to find the optimum solution at each iteration.
