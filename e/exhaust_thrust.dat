40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of recently completed {{research in the area of}} rocket noise and resulting dynamic behavior of launch pad structures. To gain accurate insight into the vibratory behavior of these structures, dynamic tests were integrated into the design process. Aspects of the acoustic load characterization procedure and the test-analysis correlation of random vibration structural response in the low frequency range (1 to 50 hertz) are presented. BACKGROUND During a Space Shuttle launch (figure 1), ground support equipment and structures in close proximity of the launch pad are subjected to intense sound pressure loads generated by rocket <b>exhausts</b> (<b>thrust</b> > 6 E+ 06 pounds).

50|$|Indirect cycling {{involves}} thermal exchange {{outside of}} the core. The compressor air {{would be sent to}} a heat exchanger. The nuclear reactor core would heat up pressurized water or liquid metal and send it to the heat exchanger as well. That hot liquid would be cooled by the air; the air would be heated by the liquid and sent to the turbine. The turbine would send the air out the <b>exhaust,</b> providing <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
50|$|Target-type thrust {{reversal}} (also called Bucket Thrust Reversal) is a {{deceleration method}} when an aircraft lands.

50|$|The 310 first flew on January 3, 1953 with {{deliveries}} {{starting in}} late 1954. The sleek modern {{lines of the}} new twin were backed up by innovative features such as engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>thrust</b> augmenter tubes and the storage of all fuel in tip tanks in early models. In 1964, the engine exhaust was changed to flow under the wing instead of the augmenter tubes, which {{were considered to be}} noisy.|$|E
50|$|In modern day, light jet general {{aviation}} aircraft {{such as the}} Cirrus Vision, Eclipse 400 or the unmanned aerial drone Global Hawk often have the power plant placed outside the aircraft to protect the passengers and make certification easier.

50|$|Ideally, a mixer {{is also a}} {{performance}} benefit to increasing thrust. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>thrust</b> from a jet engine is equal to exhaust mass flow times exhaust velocity, ie, Thrust = ṁv, while the energy to make that thrust is given by Energy = 1/2mv2. A mixer helps reduce the fastest exhaust velocities from {{the core of the}} engine, while making the average exhaust velocity faster, producing more thrust with the same energy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>thrust</b> in a {{turboprop}} is sacrificed {{in favor}} of shaft power, which is obtained by extracting additional power (up to that necessary to drive the compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system, the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low. Consequently, the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10% of the total thrust. A higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds. Turboprops can have bypass ratios up to 50-100 although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.|$|E

The airplane is taxied inside the structure and turned so the <b>exhaust</b> and <b>thrust</b> is facing the rear wall. The mechanics can then run the engines at high power. A majority of the noise will be either absorbed by the walls or deflected upward, reducing the impact to the surrounding community.|$|R

50|$|A {{turbojet}} engine is a {{gas turbine engine}} that works by compressing air with an inlet and a compressor (axial, centrifugal, or both), mixing fuel with the compressed air, burning the mixture in the combustor, and then passing the hot, high pressure air through a turbine and a nozzle. The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it. The engine converts internal energy in the fuel to kinetic energy in the <b>exhaust,</b> producing <b>thrust.</b> All the air ingested by the inlet is passed through the compressor, combustor, and turbine, unlike the turbofan engine described below.|$|R

Because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only a power shaft, this engine is sometimes classified as a free turbine. The engine, a Proteus 705, was specially modified by Bristol's Stanley Hooker to have a power shaft {{at each end of}} the engine. These shafts are connected directly to final drive assemblies with differentials and fixed ratios of 3.6 to 1 providing power to all four wheels via half-shafts.|$|E
50|$|All {{practical}} airbreathing {{jet engines}} are internal combustion engines that directly heat {{the air by}} burning fuel, with the resultant hot gases used for propulsion via a propulsive nozzle, although other techniques for heating the air have been experimented with (such as nuclear jet engines). Most modern jet engine designs are turbofans, which have largely replaced turbojets. These modern engines use a gas turbine engine core with high overall pressure ratio (about 40:1 in 1995) and high turbine entry temperature (about 1800 K in 1995), and provide {{a great deal of}} their thrust with a turbine-power fan stage, rather than with pure <b>exhaust</b> <b>thrust</b> as in a turbojet. These features combine to give a high efficiency, relative to a turbojet. A few jet engines use simple ram effect (ramjet) or pulse combustion (pulsejet) to give compression.|$|E

50|$|Two X-31s were built, {{with the}} first flying on October 11, 1990. Over 500 test flights were carried out between 1990 and 1995. The X-31 is a canard delta, a delta wing {{aircraft}} which uses canard foreplanes for primary pitch control, with secondary thrust-vectoring control. The canard delta had earlier been used on the Saab Viggen strike fighter, and has since become common on fighters such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Gripen which were all designed and flew several years before the X-31. The X-31 featured a cranked-delta wing (similar to the Saab J35 Draken and the F-16XL prototype), and fixed strakes along the aft fuselage, {{as well as a}} pair of movable computer-controlled canards to increase stability and maneuverability. There are no moveable horizontal tail surfaces, only the vertical fin with rudder. Pitch and yaw are controlled by the canard with the aid of the three paddles directing the <b>exhaust</b> (<b>thrust</b> vectoring). Eventually, simulation tests on one of the X-31s showed that flight would have been stable had the plane been designed without the vertical fin, because the thrust-vectoring nozzle provided sufficient yaw and pitch control.|$|E

Three different types of thrust deflector systems were examined: 90 deg downward deflected nozzle, 90 deg slotted nozzle with boundary layer control, and an externally blown flap configuration. Several nozzle locations were tested, including over and underwing positions. The interference lift of the nacelle and model due to jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>thrust</b> is compared and results show that 90 deg turned nozzles located over the wing (near the trailing edge) produce the largest interference lift increment for an untrimmed aircraft, and that the slotted nozzle located under the wing near the trailing edge (in conjunction with a BLC flap) gives a comparable interference lift in the trimmed condition. The externally blown flap nozzle produced the least interference lift and significantly less total lift due to jet thrust effects...|$|E
50|$|A {{gas turbine}} is a rotary machine {{somewhat}} similar {{in principle to}} a steam turbine. It consists of three main components: compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. The air is compressed by the compressor where a temperature rise occurs. The compressed air is further heated by combustion of injected fuel in the combustion chamber which expands the air. This energy rotates the turbine which powers the compressor via a mechanical coupling. The hot gases are then <b>exhausted</b> to provide <b>thrust.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Falcon 20 {{is powered}} by a pair of {{rear-mounted}} turbojet engines; most commonly powered by a pair of General Electric CF700 engines, the type has also been powered by alternative powerplants, including the Garrett TFE731 and Garrett ATF3 engines. The adoption of newer engines often had the benefit of improving the Falcon 20's range in addition to increased speed and climb rate; this, in combination with its low-drag fuselage, required more careful speed planning than the majority of business jets. On some models, protection against engine conditions such as instances of over-speed and over-temp is provided by electronic flight computers, as is the aircraft's 'throttle-lock' power management system to maintain safe levels of engine power throughout climbs without any crew commands. As conventional thrust reversers are not compatible with the location of the engines, an alternative configuration in the form of rotatable doors fixed to the outer cowling of the engine partially cover both the engine fan and core <b>exhaust,</b> deflecting <b>thrust</b> upwards and forwards.|$|R
50|$|Increasing <b>exhaust</b> {{velocity}} increases <b>thrust</b> {{for a given}} mass flow, but {{matching the}} exhaust velocity to the air speed provides the best energy efficiency. However, momentum considerations prevent jet aircraft from maintaining velocity while exceeding their exhaust jet speed. The engines of supersonic jet aircraft, {{such as those of}} fighters and SST aircraft (e.g. Concorde) almost always achieve the high exhaust speeds necessary for supersonic flight by using a CD nozzle despite weight and cost penalties; conversely, subsonic jet engines employ relatively low, subsonic, exhaust velocities and therefore employ simple convergent nozzle, or even bypass nozzles at even lower speeds.|$|R
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the <b>exhaust</b> to cause <b>thrust</b> vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|R

40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of the Silent Aircraft Initiative's SAX- 40 concept design for extremely low noise has been performed. A NASA team developed a list of 27 risk items, and evaluated the level of risk for each item {{in terms of the}} likelihood that the risk would occur and the consequences of the occurrence. The following risk items were identified as high risk, meaning that the combination of likelihood and consequence put them into the top one-fourth of the risk matrix: structures and weight prediction; boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) and inlet design; variable-area <b>exhaust</b> and <b>thrust</b> vectoring; displaced-threshold and continuous descent approach (CDA) operational concepts; cost; human factors; and overall noise performance. Several advanced-technology baseline concepts were created to serve as a basis for comparison to the SAX- 40 concept. These comparisons indicate that the SAX- 40 would have significantly greater research, development, test, and engineering (RDT&E) and production costs than a conventional aircraft with similar technology levels. Therefore, the cost of obtaining the extremely low noise capability that has been estimated for the SAX- 40 is significant. The SAX- 40 concept design proved successful in focusing attention toward low noise technologies and in raising public awareness of the issue...|$|R

Power from the turbine was transmitted {{by means of a}} one-piece shaft to the pump. The velocity of the LOX was increased through the inducer and impeller.
