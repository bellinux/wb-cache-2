Assuming linear valuation, no-arbitrage, dividend irrelevance and clean surplus accounting, we show that when earnings components aggregate, valuation expressions and abnormal earnings dynamics are generalizations of the Ohlson (1995) model, incorporating simple adjustments for accounting conservatism. When "core" earnings are the relevant earnings construct, valuation expressions closely resemble the aggregation case, but core (abnormal) earnings replaces clean surplus (abnormal) earnings.

40|$|Abstract: We {{sketch a}} theory in which presuppositions do not {{directly}} impose {{conditions on the}} context set, but rather on the contextual meaning of a sentence. Specifically, a part of an expression's meaning which is marked as presupposed should satisfy a principle of Transparency, according to which this part can be disregarded without affecting the contextual meaning of the sentence. We argue that if Transparency is checked incrementally, i. e. {{as soon as a}} clause is pronounced, it yields a predictive account of presupposition projection: unlike competing theories, it derives the projection behavior of connectives from their bivalent semantic contribution. We further speculate that Transparency originates from a more general pragmatic principle, Be Articulate!, which states that one should not say too much at the same time, i. e. express a meaning that is too complex with a single expression. Transparency is a way to satisfy Be Articulate! even when an expression with a complex meaning is uttered because it ensures that part of this meaning can be disregarded. 1.

A central aspect of historical {{research is to}} provide explanations for the causes and effects of events {{that occurred in the}} past. In order to be more concrete, a major war, in particular the Second World War, will be considered such a historical event. History can be analyzed and explained from different perspectives. This paper considers two such perspectives, the first being the traditional historiographic approach, in which the main emphasis is on the qualitative analysis of various kinds of historical sources and documents, and the second being what we call the financial market approach, a recent methodology for linking significant changes in historical market prices to simultaneously occurring geopolitical events. This study seeks to identify the fundamental characteristics of the two approaches and how they compare in answering some important historical questions concerning the Second World War.

40|$|Background: Aberrant hypermethylation of CpG {{islands in}} {{housekeeping}} gene promoters and widespread genome hypomethylation are typical events occurring in cancer cells. The molecular mechanisms behind these cancer-related changes in DNA methylation patterns {{are not well}} understood. Two questions are particularly important: (<b>i)</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> CpG islands protected from methylation in normal cells, and how is this protection compromised in cancer cells, and (ii) how does the genome-wide demethylation in cancer cells occur. The latter question is especially intriguing since so far no DNA demethylase enzyme has been found. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our data show {{that the absence of}} ADP-ribose polymers (PARs), caused by ectopic over-expression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) in L 929 mouse fibroblast cells leads to aberrant methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the Dnmt 1 gene, which in turn shuts down its transcription. The transcriptional silencing of Dnmt 1 may be responsible for the widespread passive hypomethylation of genomic DNA which we detect on the example of pericentromeric repeat sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results show that in normal cells the Dnmt 1 promoter is occupied by poly(ADP-ribosyl) ated Parp 1, suggesting that PARylated Parp 1 plays a role in protecting the promoter from methylation. Conclusions/Significance: In conclusion, the genome methylation pattern following PARG over-expression mirrors th...|$|E

We studied these two questions by recording neurons in primary somatosensory (S 1) and dorsal premotor (DPC) cortex while trained monkeys reported whether the temporal pattern structure of two sequential vibrotactile stimuli (of equal mean frequency) was the same or different. We found that S 1 neurons coded the temporal patterns in a literal way and only during the stimulation periods and did not reflect the monkeys' decisions. In contrast, DPC neurons coded the stimulus patterns as broader categories and signaled them during the working memory, comparison, and decision periods. These results show that the initial sensory representation is transformed into an intermediate, more abstract categorical code that combines past and present information to ultimately generate a perceptually informed choiceThis work {{was supported in part by}} the Dirección de Asuntos del Personal Académico de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (R.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{literature}} of the validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Method: A review of the 747 identified papers that used HADS was performed to address the following questions: (<b>I)</b> <b>How</b> <b>are</b> the factor structure, discriminant validity and the internal consistency of HADS? (II) How does HADS perform as a case finder for anxiety disorders and depression? (III) How does HADS agree with other self-rating instruments used to rate anxiety and depression? Results: Most factor analyses demonstrated a two-factor solution in good accordance with the HADS subscales for Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D), respectively. The correlations between the two subscales varied from. 40 to. 74 (mean. 56). Cronbach’s alpha for HADS-A varied from. 68 to. 93 (mean. 83) and for HADS-D from. 67 to. 90 (mean. 82). In most studies an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved when caseness was defined by a score of 8 or above on both HADS-A and HADS-D. The sensitivity and specificity for both HADS-A and HADS-D of approximately 0. 80 were very similar to the sensitivity and specificity achieved by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).

40|$|Plants {{react to}} their {{environment}} and to management interventions by adjusting physiological functions and structure. Functional–structural plant models (FSPM), combine {{the representation of}} three-dimensional (3 D) plant structure with selected physiological functions. An FSPM consists of an architectural part (plant structure) and a process part (plant functioning). The first deals with (i) the types of organs that are initiated and the way these are connected (topology), (ii) co-ordination in organ expansion dynamics, and (iii) geometrical variables (e. g. leaf angles, leaf curvature). The process part may include any physiological or physical process that affects plant growth and development (e. g. photosynthesis, carbon allocation). This paper addresses the following questions: (<b>i)</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> FSPM constructed, and (ii) for what purposes are they useful? Static, architectural models are distinguished from dynamic models. Static models are useful in order to study the significance of plant structure, such as light distribution in the canopy, gas exchange, remote sensing, pesticide spraying studies, and interactions between plants and biotic agents. Dynamic models serve quantitatively to integrate knowledge on plant functions and morphology as modulated by environment. Applications are {{in the domain of}} plant sciences, for example the study of plant plasticity as related to changes in the red:far red ratio of light in the canopy. With increasing availability of genetic information, FSPM will {{play a role in the}} assessment of the significance towards plant performance o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract According to {{a growing}} trend in {{theoretical}} neuroscience, the human perceptual system is akin to a Bayesian machine. The aim {{of this paper is}} to clearly articulate the claims that perception can be considered Bayesian inference and that the brain can be considered a Bayesian machine, some of their epistemological challenges, and some of their implications. We address two questions: <b>i)</b> <b>How</b> <b>are</b> Bayesian models used in theoretical neuroscience? ii) From the use of Bayesian models in theoretical neuroscience, have we learned or can we hope to learn that perception is Bayesian inference or that the brain is a Bayesian machine? From actual practice in theoretical neuroscience, we argue for three claims. First, currently Bayesian models do not provide mechanistic explanations; instead they are useful devices for predicting and systematizing observational statements about people’s performances in a variety of perceptual tasks. That is, currently we should have an instrumentalist attitude towards Bayesian models in neuroscience. Second, the inference typically drawn from Bayesian behavioural performance in a variety of perceptual tasks to underlying Bayesian mechanisms should be understood within the three-level framework laid out by David Marr ([1982]). Third, we can hope to learn that perception is Bayesian inference or that the brain is a Bayesian machine to the extent that Bayesian models will prove successful in yielding secure and informative predictions of both subjects ’ perceptual performance and features of the underlying neural mechanisms...|$|E

The perspectives of disability office workers (n= 1) and instructors (n= 3) are also included to offer triangulated accounts. I address the following research questions: (<b>i)</b> <b>How</b> <b>are</b> disabled and mad students constituted and represented in Ontario university settings? How do they understand and constitute themselves? (ii) What are mad and disabled students socio-spatial university experiences in relation to issues of access and academic accommodations? I draw theoretically on Foucault and other socio-spatial theorists such as Lefebvre and Soja to consider how university academic accommodations may function as regimes of truths discursively and materially shaping the lives of disabled and Mad students. I sketch cartographies of the present ways disabled and mad students are constituted and come to constitute themselves as disabled subjects. Case study methodology is employed to generate insights into knowledge-power relations shaping disabled and mad subjectivities. This research contributes new knowledge of disablement in university settings with key findings discussing how complex socio-spatial institutional knowledge-power relations shape notions of dis/ability and how disabled students become understood as mis/fits in university settings. This research demonstrates the significance of socio-spatialities in mad and disabled students’ lives, attends to how they are perpetually (re) positioned within institutional spaces, how they craft, understand, and forge their own spaces.

The study is guided by the following three research questions: <b>i)</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> workload and negative WHI temporally related?

(research question 2); and iii) do husbands’ work demands and psychological health cross over to their wives’ home demands and psychological health? (research question 3). The main conclusions of this thesis are that: i) negative WHI can be both an antecedent and a consequence of workload; ii) our newly developed WH culture measure is robust across a wide variety of workers and is characterized by two general dimensions: support and hindrance; iii) more supportive WH cultures are related to higher utilization of flextime, part time work and subsidized child care, to lower levels of negative WHI, and to higher levels of positive WHI and positive HWI; and iv) husbands’ workload and psychological health are related to their wives’ home demands and psychological health. The main (three-level) practical implications of this thesis are: i) organization-level interventions; both governments and employers should offer employees a wide variety of flexible and care-related arrangements, and employers should support the use of these arrangements; ii) couple-level interventions; work-home arrangements, (un) paid help in the household and/or time management courses may decrease crossover effects between partners; and iii) individual-level interventions; focus on specific goals, time management, and leisure activities may reduce high levels of workload and work-home interference...|$|E
