40|$|<b>Gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidases</b> (γ-GTs) {{belong to}} the N-terminal {{nucleophile}} hydrolase superfamily, enzymes that cleave the γ-glutamyl amide bond of glutathione to give cysteinylglycine.

Furthermore, this enzyme is used as a marker of liver disease and cancer.

40|$|Background : Endoparasitoid wasps are {{important}} natural {{enemies of the}} widely distributed aphid pests and are mainly used as biological control agents. [br/] However, despite the increased interest on aphid interaction networks, only sparse information {{is available on the}} factors used by parasitoids to modulate the aphid physiology. [br/] Our aim was here to identify the major protein components of the venom injected at oviposition by Aphidius ervi to ensure successful development in its aphid host, Acyrthosiphon pisum. [br/] Results : A combined large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic approach allowed us to identify 16 putative venom proteins among which three <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidases</b> (gamma-GTs) were by far the most abundant. Two of the gamma-GTs most likely correspond to alleles of the same gene, with one of these alleles previously described as involved in host castration. The third gamma-GT was only distantly related to the others and may not be functional owing to the presence of mutations in the active site. Among the other abundant proteins in the venom, several were unique to A. ervi such as the molecular chaperone endoplasmin possibly involved in protecting proteins during their secretion and transport in the host. Abundant transcripts encoding three secreted cystein-rich toxin-like peptides whose function remains to be explored were also identified. [br/] Conclusions : Our data further support the role of gamma-GTs as key players in A. ervi success on aphid hosts. However, they also evidence that this wasp venom is a complex fluid that contains diverse, more or less specific, protein components. Their characterization will undoubtedly help deciphering parasitoid-aphid and parasitoid-aphid-symbiont interactions. Finally, this study also shed light on the quick evolution of venom components through processes such as duplication and convergent recruitment of virulence factors between unrelated organisms...|$|R
40|$|Parasitism by the endophagous braconid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) has a {{negative}} impact on the reproductive activity of its host, Acyrthosiphon pisitin (Homoptera, Aphididae). The host castration is induced by the parasitoid venom and is reproduced by the injection of chromatographic fractions highly enriched with two proteins, of 18 (p 18) and 36 kDa (p 36) in size, respectively. Here we demonstrate that these bioactive proteins trigger apoptosis of the cells in the germaria and ovariole sheath of the host aphid. Both p 18 and p 36 were internally sequenced and the gathered information was matched against the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative proteins encoded by cDNA clones, randomly selected from a cDNA library, which was raised using mRNA extracted from A. ervi venom glands. The identified cDNA clones contained an insert corresponding to the RNA product of an interrupted gene, made of six exons and five introns, which was found to be transcribed at higher levels in adult females of A. ervi than in mates. This gene codes for a putative protein composed of 541 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 56. 9 kDa, which contained the amino acid sequences experimentally determined for both p 18 and p 36. This putative protein showed a significant level of sequence identity with <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidases</b> (gamma-GT), and it was named Ae-gamma-GT. The gamma-GTs are enzymes which {{play a key role in}} the metabolism of glutathione (GSH) and, as observed in most organisms, they are membrane-bound heterodimers formed by a large and a small subunit, which originate by post-translational processing of a single-chain precursor. The expression in insect cells of Ae-gamma-GT confirmed the occurrence of the expected post-translational processing, and demonstrated that, unlike other gamma-GTs, this protein is secreted in the extracellular environment. A measurable gamma-GT activity was detected in the venom of A. ervi and in the chromatographic fractions containing Ae-gamma-GT. Thus, we suggest that this venom protein may induce apoptosis in the host ovarioles by generating an alteration of the GSH metabolism and a consequent oxidative stress. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Mutations in {{the mouse}} p (pink-eyed dilution) and human P genes lead to melanosomal defects and ocular {{developmental}} abnormalities. Despite {{the critical role}} played by the p gene product in controlling tyrosinase processing and melanosome biogenesis, its precise biological function is still not defined. We have expressed p heterologously in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study its function in greater detail. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that p reaches the yeast vacuolar membrane via the prevacuolar compartment. Yeast cells expressing p exhibited increased sensitivity to a number of toxic compounds, including arsenicals. Similarly, cultured murine melanocytes expressing a functional p gene were also found to be more sensitive to arsenical compounds compared with p-null cell lines. Intracellular glutathione, known {{to play a role in}} detoxification of arsenicals, was diminished by 50 % in p-expressing yeast. By using the glutathione-conjugating dye monochlorobimane, in combination with acivicin, an inhibitor of vacuolar <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> cysteine <b>transpeptidase,</b> involved in the breakdown of glutathione, we found that p facilitates the vacuolar accumulation of glutathione. Our data demonstrate that the pink-eyed dilution protein increases cellular sensitivity to arsenicals and other metalloids and can modulate intracellular glutathione metabolism...|$|R

This peptide coupling is unique in that it occurs between the amino moiety of the cysteine and the terminal carboxylic acid of the glutamate side chain (hence the name gamma-glutamyl cysteine). This peptide bond is resistant to cleavage by cellular peptidases and requires a specialized enzyme, <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (γGT), to metabolize γ-GC and GSH into its constituent amino acids.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Schulman {{joined the}} staff of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development where he headed the Section on Human Biochemical Genetics, and founded and was first Director of the Interinstitute Program in Medical Genetics.

During this period, the major research contributions of Schulman and his associates were in the field of the inborn errors of metabolism, especially diseases of sulfur metabolism. They demonstrated that cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by hereditary absence of the transmembrane lysosomal carrier for cystine, and proved that the enzyme <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> was not, contrary to current theory, required for normal transcellular amino acid transport. Schulman and David Cogan of the National Eye Institute were also the first to utilize cysteamine eyedrops for treatment of the painful photophobia and ocular crystals characteristic of cystinosis, and this treatment is widely utilized today.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase,</b> {{one of the}} enzymes of the γ-glutamyl cycle, {{is present in the}} melanocytes of the eyes of rhesus macaques. Enzyme activity was detected in active melanin-synthesizing melanocytes of the iris stroma and in fetal and neonatal retinal pigment epithelium. It was not detected in adult retinal pigment epithelium or choroidal melanocytes, which are ontogenetically more advanced in development and have little melanogenic activity. Our data show that <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> activity correlates well with growth, early differentiation, and active melanogenesis, and support the hypothesis that in addition to tyrosinase, a second enzyme, such as <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase,</b> takes part in the melanin and pheomelanin metabolic pathways...|$|E
40|$|These studies {{indicate}} that gamma-glutamylcyst(e) ine, found in the urine of a patient with <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> deficiency {{and also in the}} urine of experimental animals injected with glutathione or with inhibitors of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase,</b> is formed by the action of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. The evidence demonstrates that transpeptidation between glutathione and cystine occurs in vivo and also that this reaction constitutes a significant physiological function of the enzyme. The appearance of large amounts of gamma-glutamylcyst(e) ine in the urine seems to reflect an inhibitory effect of glutathione on the transport of gamma-glutamylcyst(e) ine into cells. The findings also indicate that conversion of glutathione to gamma-glutamylcysteine by hydrolytic cleavage of the COOH-terminal glycine moiety of glutathione (or analogous cleavage of glutathione disulfide) is not a quantitatively significant pathway. The results reported here show that <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> activity is not completely absent in a patient found to have a deficiency of this enzyme and that the activity of the enzyme is not abolished in experimental animals treated with potent <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> inhibitors...|$|E

Mean activity of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> in the control samples at 15 weeks was 602 U/l. Activity in the samples obtained in cases of fetal chromosome abnormality was generally below this: it was below the 10 th percentile in 74 % of the samples and below the 2. 5 th percentile in 52 % of the cases.

40|$|The {{reversible}} {{conversion of}} leukotriene C 4 to leukotriene D 4 {{and of the}} latter to leukotriene E 4 were studied with highly purified homogeneous preparations of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase,</b> dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase M. The conversion of leukotriene C 4 to leukotriene D 4, catalyzed by <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase,</b> is significantly more rapid when {{carried out in the}} presence of an amino acid mixture a closely approximating that found in blood plasma and is accompanied by gamma-glutamyl amino acid formation. Because <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> is bound to the external surface of cell membranes and thus is readily accessible to plasma amino acids, it appears that conversion of leukotriene C 4 to leukotriene D 4 under physiological conditions is coupled with the formation of gamma-glutamyl amino acids. The apparent Km value for leukotriene C 4 in this reaction is about 6 X 10 (- 6) M, a value close to that found for glutathione. Conversion of leukotriene D 4 to leukotriene C 4 is effectively catalyzed by <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> in the presence of relatively low concentrations of glutathione. The conversion of leukotriene D 4 to leukotriene E 4 is catalyzed much more rapidly by renal dipeptidase than by renal aminopeptidase M. Incubation of leukotriene E 4 with <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> and glutathione leads to formation of a compound with the properties of gamma-glutamyl leukotriene E 4; this reaction is analogous to that shown previously in which gamma-glutamyl cystine is formed by transpeptidation between glutathione and cystine...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{treated with}} potent <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> inhibitors and {{a patient with}} severe <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> {{deficiency}} excrete much larger than normal amounts of glutathione, gamma-glutamylcysteine, and cysteine in their urine; these compounds were found in disulfide forms. The findings indicate that the metabolic function of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> {{is associated with the}} metabolism or transport (or both) of cysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine, and glutathione, and that gamma-glutamylcysteine is a physiological substrate of the enzyme. The occurrence of gamma-glutamylcysteine in urine and other considerations suggest that this dipeptide is formed as an extracellular metabolite of glutathione in addition to its recognized role as an intrcellular precursor of glutathione. The dipeptide may be formed by a pathway involving transpeptidation or by cleavage of the Cys-Gly bond of glutathione.

The findings, which show that the gamma-glutamyl cycle functions in vivo, support the conclusion that gamma-glutamyl amino acids formed by <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> from externally supplied amino acids and intracellular glutathione are translocated into the cell and thus indicate {{that there is a}} significant physiological connection between the metabolism of glutathione and the transport of amino acids...|$|E

When whole tissue homogenates were treated with papain to solubilize the enzyme and then focused, the same relationship held. The neuraminidase activities in the two homogenates were similar, but the sialytransferase activity (CMP-N-acetylneuraminate:D-galactosyl-glycoprotein N-acetylneuraminyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 99. 1) of the tumor homogenate was 13 times that of the normal mammary homogenate.

The findings indicate that the administered gamma-glutamyl compounds effectively compete with glutathione (exported from kidney cells and present in the glomerular filtrate) for the enzyme. The administration of certain gamma-glutamyl amino acids appears to be a specific and nontoxic procedure for in vivo inhibition of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> that may be useful in experimental work on glutathione metabolism and function and also for treatment of certain toxicities and for modulation of the metabolism of endogenous glutathione conjugates...|$|E

40|$|Glutathione is {{translocated}} out of cells; {{cells that}} have membrane-bound <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> can utilize translocated glutathione, whereas glutathione exported from cells {{that do not}} have appreciable transpeptidase enters the blood plasma.

Studies in which mice and rats were treated with buthionine sulfoximine, a selective and potent inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and therefore of glutathione synthesis, show that glutathione turns over at a significant rate in many tissues, especially kidney, liver, and pancreas; the rate of turnover in mouse skeletal muscle is about 60 % of that in the kidney. Experiments on rats surgically deprived of one or both kidneys and treated with the <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> inhibitor D-gamma-glutamyl-(o-carboxy) phenylhydrazide establish that extrarenal <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> activity accounts for the utilization of about one-third of the total blood plasma glutathione.
