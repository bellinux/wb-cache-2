40|$|Objectives: An {{important}} {{option for}} the medical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. This study reports on the cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> and lifestyle advice. The work was commissioned by the NHS HTA Programme to inform the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) appraisal of CPAP. Methods: A Markov model compared the interventions over the expected patient lifetime. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY incorporated the impact of treatments on daytime sleepiness, blood pressure and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: On average, CPAP was associated with higher costs and QALYs compared with <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> or lifestyle advice. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CPAP compared with <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> was around £ 4, 000 per QALY (2005 - 06 prices). The probability that CPAP is more cost-effective than <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> or lifestyle advice at a threshold value of £ 20, 000 per QALY was 0. 78 for men and 0. 80 for women. Several sensitivity analyses were undertaken and {{it was found that}} the ICER for CPAP consistently fell below £ 20, 000 per QALY gained, apart from in a subgroup with mild disease. Conclusions: The model suggests that CPAP is cost-effective compared with <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> and lifestyle advice for adults with moderate or severe symptomatic OSAHS at the cost-effectiveness thresholds used by NICE. This finding is reflected in the NICE guidance. Copyright © 2009 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|Bariatric {{surgery is}} a valid {{treatment}} alternative for obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but subjects who are overweight or obe se represent a poor model to investigate the role of OSA treatment on cardiovascular variables, calling into question the attribution of cardiovascular and metabolic problems associated with OSA with excess weight. Seventeen patients with significant obesity who demonstrated OSA with a high apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were treated with bariatric surgery alone after refusal of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. At approximately 3 years post-surgery, subjects demonstrated a significant drop in blood pressure measured at rest, improvement in sleepiness and fatigue visual analogue scales, but continued to complain of daytime sleepiness.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: Untreated obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea {{syndrome}} (OSAHS) {{is associated}} with excessive daytime sleepiness, increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, and road traffic accidents (RTAs), which impact survival and health-related quality of life. This study, funded by the French National Authority for Health (HAS), aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of different treatments (i. e., continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], <b>dental</b> <b>devices,</b> lifestyle advice, and no treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate OSAHS in France. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of two cohorts, stratified by CV risk, over a lifetime horizon. Daytime sleepiness and RTAs were taken into account for all patients while CV events were only considered for patients with high CV risk. Results: For patients with low CV risk, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> versus no treatment varied between 32, 976 EUR (moderate OSAHS) and 45, 579 EUR (mild OSAHS) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and CPAP versus <b>dental</b> <b>devices,</b> above 256, 000 EUR/QALY. For patients with high CV risk, CPAP {{was associated with a}} gain of 0. 62 QALY compared with no treatment, resulting in an ICER of 10, 128 EUR/QALY. Conclusion: The analysis suggests that it is efficient to treat all OSAHS patients with high CV risk with CPAP and that <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> are more efficient than CPAP for mild-to-moderate OSAHS with low CV risk. However, out-of-pocket costs are currently much higher for <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> than for CPAP (i. e., 3, 326 EUR versus 2, 430 EUR) as orthodontic treatment is mainly non-refundable in France...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices {{for the treatment}} of obstructive apnoea - hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS), compared with the best supportive care, placebo and <b>dental</b> <b>devices.</b> Data sources: The main search was of fifteen electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, up to November 2006. Review methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CPAP with best supportive/usual care, placebo, and <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> in adults with a diagnosis of OSAHS were included. The primary outcomes of interest were subjective daytime sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and objective sleepiness assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). A new economic model was developed to assess incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness of CPAP was compared with that of the use of <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> and conservative management. The costs and QALYs were compared over a lifetime time horizon. Effectiveness was based on the RCT evidence on sleepiness symptoms (ESS), which was 'mapped' to utilities using individual patient data from a subset of studies. Utilities were expressed on the basis of generic HRQoL instruments [the EQ- 5 D (EuroQoL- 5 Dimensions) in the base-case analysis]. The base-case analysis focused on a male aged 50. A series of subgroup and scenario analyses were also undertaken. Results: The searches yielded 6325 citations, from which 48 relevant clinical effectiveness studies were identified, 29 of these providing data on daytime sleepiness. The majority of the included RCTs did not report using an adequate method of allocation concealment or use an intention-to-treat analysis. Only the studies using a sham CPAP comparator were double blinded. There was a statistically significant benefit with CPAP compared with control (placebo and conservative treatment/usual care) on the ESS [mean difference (MD) - 2. 7 points, 95 % CI- 3. 45 to- 1. 96]. However, there was statistical heterogeneity, which was reduced when trials were subgrouped by severity of disease. There was also a significant benefit with CPAP compared with usual care on the MWT. There was a non-statistically significant difference between CPAP and <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> (six trials) in the impact on daytime sleepiness (ESS) among a population with moderate symptom severity at baseline (MD- 0. 9, 95 % CI- 2. 1 to 0. 4). A review of five studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CPAP was undertaken. All existing cost-effectiveness studies had limitations; therefore a new economic model was developed, based on which it was found that, on average, CPAP was associated with higher costs and benefits than <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> or conservative management. The incremental cost per QALY gained of CPAP was below £ 20, 000 in the base-case analysis and most alternative scenarios. There was a high probability of CPAP being more cost-effective than <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> and conservative management for a cost-effectiveness threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY gained. Conclusions: CPAP is an effective and cost-effective treatment for OSAHS compared with conservative/usual care and placebo in populations with moderate to severe daytime sleepiness, and there may be benefits when the disease is mild. <b>Dental</b> <b>devices</b> may be a treatment option in moderate disease but some uncertainty remains.

30|$|Corrosion and {{fracture}} of Ni-Ti superelastic alloys used as dental devices {{in the oral}} cavity are serious problems (Yokoyama et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2007). Fluoride contained in toothpastes and prophylactic agents has a cariostatic effect, {{and it has been}} reported that the corrosion resistance of Ni-Ti alloys is lost in fluoride solutions (Huang 2007; Lee et al. 2009; Li et al. 2007; Mirjalili et al. 2013; Schiff et al. 2002; Schiff et al. 2004). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that degradation of the mechanical properties of Ti, Ti alloys, and Ni-Ti alloys occurs in acidic and neutral fluoride solutions (Yokoyama et al. 2003 a; Yokoyama et al. 2004 a; Yokoyama et al. 2004 b; Kaneko et al. 2003; Yokoyama et al. 2005). Ni-Ti alloys absorb substantial amounts of hydrogen from acidic fluoride solutions, thereby causing hydrogen embrittlement of the alloys (Yokoyama et al. 2003 a; Yokoyama et al. 2004 a). Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanism for the hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-Ti superelastic alloy in acidic fluoride solutions so that the reliability and safety of the alloy as a <b>dental</b> <b>device</b> can be improved.|$|E

In endodontic treatments, cotton wool is placed beneath the temporary filling to preserve {{the space of the}} pulp chamber and to prevent any blockage of the root canals with temporary filling between clinic visits. Despite its simple application and affordability, cotton wool can lead to fibrous remnants in the pulp chamber or become incorporated into the temporary filling, which can lead to micro-leakage or bacterial colonization on the cotton fibers and subsequent infection. Gelatin capsules or silica gels are proposed endodontic materials which can replace cotton wool in root canal therapy by creating a barrier for entry into the root canals and conferring mechanical stability to the temporary filling above. An innovative and clinically suitable delivery device is required to catalyze the use of novel endodontic materials in place of cotton wool during root canal therapy. The proposed solution is a device that will deliver a variety of endodontic material into the pulp cavity.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (summary) : The current {{doctorate}} {{was primarily}} concerned with the topic bite force and bite pressure measurement on the patient by using the patented method of analysis (DE 10317245) by MUELLER et al [53]. The main task was to estimate {{the distribution of the}} masticatory force, chewing pressure and occlusal contact area depending on the age and sex. Furthermore it was necessary to evaluate the practicability of the modified precsale® procedure by FINK [9]. For this purpose a mobile handheld calibration device was constructed {{with the support of the}} MTL [46] that problem-free allows the necessary calibration adjustment of the foils after use. By the help of a specially created calibration value database it was possible to calculate potential storage and measurement errors. As to that the by FUKUDA [13], OTTL et al [58] and FINK [9] accurately described linear trough mild sigmoidal correlation between appliqued force and calculated color density was confirmed. Additional in vitro advance tests were necessary and demonstrated a relative error of the measurement chain â€ 10 % at room temperature (+ 20 °C). Furthermore it was shown that the mobile handheld calibration device generated reproducible, valid reference points on the prescale® folies with a constant reference pressure of 86, 9 Â± 2, 2 MPa with a calculated total static load force of 54, 0 SD ± 3, 0 N as much as a steady reference area about 0, 63 Â± 0, 01 mm². In cooperation with KLEIBER [34] for the data evaluation the software zahni Â© was developed that based on the source code by FEIKS and FINK [9]. Additionally the pressure selectivity of the prescale® mono sheet type MS could enlarged to a range from 2 to 120 MPa because of the new calibration and analysis procedure. Altogether the main study with a number of 178 patients (gender ratio 1 : 1) and aged between 3 to 94 showed firstly a mean chewing surface of 21, 8 Â± 14, 9 mm², secondly a mean total occlusal force of 920, 6 Â± 553, 4 N and in the third place a mean total bite pressure of 47, 9 Â± 11, 7 MPa. Moreover the statistical computation has been demonstrated a total maximal chewing pressure of 66, 3 Â± 15, 4 MPa.

All the <b>dental</b> x-ray <b>devices</b> assessed were contaminated (tube head, timers or both) as well as all the lead aprons. The portable processing boxes showed 75 percent of contamination. The groups found no statistical significance between the different surfaces assessed and the microorganisms. The highest frequent microorganisms found were from Staphylococcus genus. The authors concluded that because of the high incidence of contamination found, the x-ray devices used in the dental clinics could be at potential risk of cross infection, demonstrating the necessity for applying biosecurity practices when taking radiographic and during radiographic processing...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF), sleep disordered breathing (SDB) [...] including obstructive and central sleep apnoea as well as periodic breathing [...] is a common condition and is believed to {{increase the risk of}} mortality. Treatment of SDB is considered important in the management of CHF. Improvements in SDB {{have a positive effect on}} cardiac output, measured with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); on neurohormonal activity, measured as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); and on the quality of life. Continuous positive airway pressure has been the traditional method used to treat SDB in {{patients with}} CHF, but compliance and tolerability are poor. A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a <b>dental</b> <b>device</b> recommended for the treatment of sleep apnoea, but the method has never been evaluated in patients with CHF. The aims of the present studies were to evaluate the practical use of the MAD for the treatment of SDB in patients with CHF and to test the hypothesis that this intervention increases the dimensions of the pharyngeal airway (PAW), reduces SDB and BNP, and improves LVEF and the quality of life. Patients with mild to moderate CHF and SDB were evaluated using a portable polysomnographic device, lateral radiographs, cardiological and odontological examinations, and quality of life measures prior to and following intervention with an custom-made MAD. At the short-term follow-up 4 - 6 weeks after habituation with the MAD, the severity of SDB according to the apnoea-hypopnoea index had decreased from 25. 1 +/- 9. 4 (mean +/- SD) to 14. 7 +/- 9. 7 (p = 0. 003). An increase in the inferior region of the PAW (7 +/- 5 mm) was observed on radiographs (p = 0. 0001). However, no correlation between the effect of the MAD on the dimensions of the PAW and its effect on SDB was found. At the 6 -month follow-up, the sleep apnoea-related symptoms had decreased by 31 % (p = 0. 003). Quality of life remained stable. BNP were reduced from 195. 8 +/- 180. 5 pg/ml to 148. 1 +/- 139. 9 pg/ml (p = 0. 035). LVEF, however, remained unchanged. At the 12 -month follow-up, 64 % of the patients were still using the MAD. Three patients withdrew from the study because of discomfort with the MAD. In most patients, MAD treatment had no severe side effect on the signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders. However, dental complications were observed. In conclusion, in patients with stable CHF who are experiencing problems with SDB, MAD intervention appears to reduce the severity of SDB, sleep apnoea-related symptoms, and neurohormonal activity. A lower tendency for PAW collapse may explain the effect observed on SDB. The reduction in plasma BNP may indicate decreased cardiac strain as a result of treatment of SDB. The 5 -year survival rate, measured from the start of MAD intervention, was higher in the group that used a MAD than in the group that did not use a MAD (p = 0. 036). No severe side effects on the stomatognathic system were observed during the intervention, and most patients [...] edentulous included [...] tolerated the treatment well. Impaired oral health, including reduced dentition and edentulousness, seemed to limit the use of the MAD in this group of elderly patients, both because of technical difficulties and because of the increased risk of dental complications. However, because the treatment of SDB is important in the management of CHF, the MAD intervention seems to be a valuable method in the treatment arsenal of SDB...|$|E

40|$|High purity alumina {{as well as}} {{zirconia}} ceramics {{have been}} widely used as orthopaedic implant biomaterials and <b>dental</b> <b>devices</b> displaying optimal, but sometimes exclusive, mechanical properties. In order to combine the advantages of alumina and zirconia ceramic materials different types of composites have been developed in which either zirconia is dispersed in an alumina matrix or vice versa. Orthopaedic and dental implant biomaterials are expected to be in contact with living tissues {{for a long period of}} time and their long term toxicity must be carefully evaluated. In this study we report the development of a high performance chromia-doped zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) material which displays promising mechanical properties in terms of hardness, strength and fracture toughness that make it suitable for prosthesis even for small joints. The long-term biocompatibility of this material was also evaluated, mainly in terms of DNA damage, mutagenicity and cancerogenetic potential in mammalian cells. The results obtained suggest that this new ZTA material does not display any longterm carcinogenic effect and it is suitable for biomedical applications from a cancerogenetic point of view. In conclusion, we report the development of a new chromia-doped ZTA material with interesting properties, both from a mechanical and a biocompatibility point of view which warrant further studies on its suitability as a candidate biomaterial for orthopaedic implants and <b>dental</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

5000|$|There are two widely cited {{potential}} virulence {{factors that}} contribute to the pathogenicity of C. glabrata. The first is a series of adhesins coded by the EPA (epithelial adhesin) genes. These genes, located in the subtelomeric region, can respond to environmental cues that allow them to be expressed en masse so the organism can adhere to biotic and abiotic surfaces in microbial mats. This is also the suspected mechanism by which C. glabrata forms microbial [...] "biofilms" [...] on urinary catheters, and less commonly in-dwelling IV catheters.
