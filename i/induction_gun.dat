Introduction For several years a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) collaboration has studied rf power sources based on the RK-TBA concept [1]. This effort has included both experiments [2] and theoretical studies. A preliminary design study for a rf power source using the RK-TBA concept suitable for an rf power source upgrade of the NLC collider design (TBNLC) has been published [3]. The design specifically ad [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} challenge for making two-beam accelerators into realizable power sources for high-energy colliders {{lies in the}} creation of the drive beam and in its propagation over long distances through multiple extraction sections. This year we have been constructing a 1. 2 &A, l-MeV, <b>induction</b> <b>gun</b> for a prototype relativistic klystron two-beam accelerator (RK-TBA). The electron source will be a 8. 9 cm diameter, thermionic, flat-surface cathode with a maximum shroud field stress of approximately 165 kV/cm. Additional design parameters for the injector include a pulse length of over 150 -ns flat top (1 % energy variation), and a normalized edge emittance of less than 300 pi-mm-n-n. The prototype accelerator will be used to study physics, engineering, and costing issues involved in the application of the RK-TBA concept to linear colliders. We have also been studying optimization parameters, such as frequency, for the application of the RK-TBA concept to multi-TeV linear colliders. As an rf power source the RK-TBA scales favorably up to frequencies around 35 GHz. An overview of this work with details of the design and performance of the prototype injector, beam line, and diagnostics will be presented...|$|E

40|$|The Toroid Bonding <b>Gun</b> is and <b>{{induction}}</b> heating device. It is a self contained, portable, {{low powered}} induction welding system developed for bonding or joining plastic, ceramic, or metallic parts. Structures can be bonded {{in a factory}} or in a the field. This type of equipment allows for applying heat directly to the bond lines and/or to the adhesives without heating the entire structure, supports, and fixtures of a bonding assembly. The <b>induction</b> heating <b>gun</b> originally developed {{for use in the}} fabrication of space Gangs of bonders are now used to rapidly join composite sheet and structural components. Other NASA-developed applications of this bonding technique include the joining of thermoplastic composites, thermosetting composites, metals, and combinations of these materials...|$|R
40|$|An {{induction}} heating device includes an <b>induction</b> heating <b>gun</b> {{which includes a}} housing, a U-shaped pole piece having two spaced apart opposite ends defining a gap there between, the U-shaped pole piece being mounted in {{one end of the}} housing, and a tank circuit including an induction coil wrapped around the pole piece and a capacitor connected to the induction coil. A power source is connected to the tank circuit. A pull test machine is provided having a stationary chuck and a movable chuck, the two chucks holding two test pieces bonded together at a bond region. The heating gun is mounted on the pull test machine in close proximity to the bond region of the two test pieces, whereby when the tank circuit is energized, the two test pieces are heated by {{induction heating}} while a tension load is applied to the two test pieces by the pull test machine to determine separation strength of the bond region...|$|R

Also in November, Stradlin released the iTunes-only single [...] "Baby-Rann"â€”his first release in over two years; an accompanying video was made available via YouTube.|$|R
40|$|The tetrapyrrole {{biosynthesis}} pathway {{results in}} the synthesis of both haem and chlorophyll and tight regulation of this pathway during de-etiolation is critical for the safe biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus. While much {{attention has been paid}} to light regulation of the total flux through this pathway less is known about the role of light in regulating the key, metal-insertion branchpoint leading either to haem or chlorophyll. Magnesium chelatase, responsible for channelling substrates into the chlorophyll branch, is composed of three subunits (CHLD, CHLH and CHLI), with a regulatory protein, GUN 4, also necessary for full enzyme activity. To understand how light affects branchpoint regulation we have studied the transcriptional regulation of the four genes encoding these proteins in de-etiolating Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using quantitative PCR. Analysis of gene expression in dark-grown seedlings transferred to far-red and red light has shown that CHLH and GUN 4 are strongly induced, while the CHLD and CHLI 1 genes show little change in expression. Comparison of expression profiles in wild-type and photoreceptor-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis indicate that regulation is primarily under the control of phytochromes A and B. These results suggest that phytochrome-mediated <b>induction</b> of <b>GUN</b> 4 and CHLH is a major mechanism for redirecting tetrapyrrole synthesis to the chlorophyll branch of the pathway during de-etiolation. We are now looking to test this hypothesis further by examining protein levels and the flux of tetrapyrrole intermediates through the branch point at this critical stage of plant development...|$|R
40|$|Several {{cryogenic}} targets must be injected each second into {{a reaction}} chamber. Required target speed is about 100 m/s. Required {{accuracy of the}} driver beams on target is a few hundred micrometers. Fuel strength is calculated to allow acceleration in excess of 10, 000 m/s{sup 2 } if the fuel temperature is less than 17 K. A 0. 1 {mu}m thick dual membrane will allow nearly 2, 000 m/s{sup 2 } acceleration. Acceleration is gradually increased and decreased over a few membrane oscillation periods (a few ms), to avoid added stress from vibrations which could otherwise cause a factor of two decrease in allowed acceleration. Movable shielding allows multiple targets to be in flight toward the reaction chamber at once while minimizing neutron heating of subsequent targets. The use of multiple injectors is recommended for redundancy which increases availability and allows a higher pulse rate. Gas <b>gun,</b> rail <b>gun,</b> <b>induction</b> accelerator, and electrostatic accelerator target injection devices are studied, and compared. A gas gun is the preferred device for indirect-drive targets due to its simplicity and proven reliability. With the gas gun, the amount of gas required for each target (about 10 to 100 mg) is acceptable. A revolver loading mechanism is recommended with a cam operated poppet valve to control the gas flow. Cutting vents near the muzzle of the gas gun barrel is recommended to improve accuracy and aid gas pumping. If a railgun is used, we recommend an externally applied magnetic field to reduce required current by an order of magnitude. Optical target tracking is recommended. Up/down counters are suggested to predict target arrival time. Target steering is shown to be feasible and would avoid the need to actively point the beams. Calculations show that induced tumble from electrostatically steering the target is not excessive...|$|R
