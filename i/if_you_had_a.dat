25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem, you could go to him and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward".|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{also sought}} to make [...] "a comment on {{television}} {{and the idea of}} the passive audience", depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low-quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Barbour {{was interviewed}} by The Weekly Standard [...] magazine. Asked about {{coming of age in}} Yazoo City during the civil rights era, he told the {{interviewer}} regarding growing up there, [...] "I just don't remember it as being that bad." [...] Barbour then credited the White Citizens' Council for keeping the KKK out of Yazoo City and ensuring the peaceful integration of its schools. Barbour dismissed comparisons between the White Citizens' Councils and the KKK, and referred to the Councils as [...] "an organization of town leaders". Barbour continued in his defense of the Councils, saying, [...] "In Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their ass run out of town. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> job, you'd lose it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> store, they'd see nobody shopped there. We didn't {{have a problem with the}} Klan in Yazoo City." [...] Barbour's statement did not address the role of the white supremacist group in publicly naming and blacklisting individuals who petitioned for educational integration and how it used political pressure and violence to force African-American residents to move.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground. The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out, [...] "I grew up watching my dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, and we tried to deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as {{what it would be like}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> second chance, but your second chance was inside of a movie?" [...] Miller and Fortin also served as executive producers, alongside Darren M. Demetre.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would be <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E
