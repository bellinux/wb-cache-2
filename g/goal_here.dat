25|$|In {{the field}} of {{mathematical}} optimization, stochastic programming is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Whereas deterministic optimization problems are formulated with known parameters, real world problems almost invariably include some unknown parameters. When the parameters are known only within certain bounds, one approach to tackling such problems is called robust optimization. Here {{the goal is to}} find a solution which is feasible for all such data and optimal in some sense. Stochastic programming models are similar in style but take advantage of the fact that probability distributions governing the data are known or can be estimated. The <b>goal</b> <b>here</b> is to find some policy that is feasible for all (or almost all) the possible data instances and maximizes the expectation of some function of the decisions and the random variables. More generally, such models are formulated, solved analytically or numerically, and analyzed in order to provide useful information to a decision-maker.|$|E
500|$|Several {{statistical}} scores can {{be based}} on the observed and forecast fields. [...] One, known as a bias, compares the size of the forecast field to the observed field, with the goal of a score of 1. [...] The threat score involves the intersection of the forecast and observed sets, with a maximum possible verification score of 1. [...] The probability of detection, or POD, is found by dividing the overlap between the forecast and observed fields {{by the size of the}} observed field: [...] the <b>goal</b> <b>here</b> is a score of 1. [...] The critical success index, or CSI, divides the overlap between the forecast and observed fields by the combined size of the forecast and observed fields: [...] the <b>goal</b> <b>here</b> is a score of 1. [...] The false alarm rate, or FAR, divides the area of the forecast which does not overlap the observed field by the size of the forecasted area. [...] The goal value in this measure is zero.|$|E

60|$|His {{face was}} no bad index to {{what went on}} within him. He was in a {{condition}} of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily life. He could not {{accept the fact that}} a lady was fifteen minutes late in keeping her appointment without seeing in that accident the frustration of his entire life. Looking at his watch, he seemed to look deep into the springs of human existence, and by the light of what he saw there altered his course towards the north and the midnight.... Yes, one's voyage must be made absolutely without companions through ice and black water--towards what <b>goal?</b> <b>Here</b> he laid his finger upon the half-hour, and decided that when the minute-hand reached that point he would go, at the same time answering the question put by another of the many voices of consciousness with the reply that there was undoubtedly a goal, but that it would need the most relentless energy to keep anywhere in its direction. Still, still, one goes on, the ticking seconds seemed to assure him, with dignity, with open eyes, with determination not to accept the second-rate, not to be tempted by the unworthy, not to yield, not to compromise. Twenty-five minutes past three were now marked upon the face of the watch. The world, he assured himself, since Katharine Hilbery was now half an hour behind her time, offers no happiness, no rest from struggle, no certainty. In a scheme of things utterly bad from the start the only unpardonable folly is that of hope. Raising his eyes for a moment from the face of his watch, he rested them upon the opposite bank, reflectively and not without a certain wistfulness, as if the sternness of their gaze were still capable of mitigation. Soon a look of the deepest satisfaction filled them, though, for a moment, he did not move. He watched a lady who came rapidly, and yet with a trace of hesitation, down the broad grass-walk towards him. She did not see him. Distance lent her figure an indescribable height, and romance seemed to surround her from the floating of a purple veil which the light air filled and curved from her shoulders.|$|E
