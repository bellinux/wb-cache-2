Doherty frequently posted about to Barât on the Libertines forum; in one post from 2003, referring to an incident in 1997 in which Barât had wanted to form a suicide pact, Doherty wrote: [...] "let's keep going i love you <b>i</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] Speaking of his separation from Doherty in 2004, Barât revealed, [...] "There was one point where I very very nearly, just {{to be close to}} him, started taking full on heroin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> <b>So</b> Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E

[...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom".
