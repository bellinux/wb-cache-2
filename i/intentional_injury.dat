25|$|For {{statistical}} purposes, {{injuries are}} classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision. <b>Intentional</b> <b>injury</b> is a common cause of traumas. Penetrating trauma is caused when a foreign body such as a bullet or a knife enters the body tissue, creating an open wound. In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80% of these deaths are caused by firearms. Blast injury is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and also may {{be accompanied by a}} burn injury. Trauma also may be associated with a particular activity, such as an occupational or sports injury.|$|E

2500|$|Clyde {{was first}} arrested in late 1926, after running when police confronted him over {{a rental car}} {{he had failed to}} return on time. His second arrest, with brother Buck, came soon after, this time for {{possession}} of stolen goods (turkeys). Despite having legitimate jobs during the period 1927 through 1929, he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. After sequential arrests in 1928 and 1929, he was sent to Eastham Prison Farm in April 1930. While in prison, Barrow used a lead pipe to crush the skull of another inmate who had sexually assaulted him repeatedly. This was Clyde Barrow's first killing, though another inmate already serving a life sentence took the blame. Barrow convinced another inmate to use an axe to chop off two of Barrow's toes to avoid hard labor in the fields; he would walk with a limp {{for the rest of his}} life as a result.

2500|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often charged for lesser infractions such as [...] "tripping", [...] "elbowing", [...] "roughing", [...] "high-sticking", [...] "delay of the game", [...] "too many {{players on the}} ice", [...] "boarding", illegal equipment, [...] "charging" [...] (leaping into an {{opponent}} or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), [...] "holding", holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), [...] "interference", [...] "hooking", [...] "slashing", [...] "kneeing", [...] "unsportsmanlike conduct" [...] (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), [...] "butt-ending" [...] (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick—a very rare penalty), [...] "spearing", or [...] "cross-checking". As of the 2005–2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [...] "diving", where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In {{the case of a}} goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in <b>intentional</b> <b>injury</b> to an opponent, or when a [...] "minor" [...] penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of [...] "boarding" [...] (defined as [...] "check an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards") is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, a myth has {{developed}} that insurance coverage {{is not available}} or allowed for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> or damage. This myth has two primary bases: one, the “fortuity” doctrine, which provides that insurance should only cover losses that happen by chance; and two, public policy, which allegedly disfavors allowing insurance for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> or damage. This article dispels that myth. Many types of liability insurance policies expressly cover intentional torts including trademark infringement, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, defamation, disparagement, and improper employment practices such as discrimination. In addition, punitive damages, which typically are awarded for intentional misconduct, are covered by insurance policies in most jurisdictions. Further, a public policy analysis actually favors allowing insurance recoveries for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> or damage.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> are an {{emerging}} silent epidemic {{in developing countries}} and contribute significantly to global injury burden. A descriptive prospective {{study was conducted to}} establish the prevalence, contributing factors, injury pattern and treatment outcome of <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> at Bugando Medical Centre in North-western Tanzania. Data was collected using a pre-tested, coded questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS software version 17. 0. A total of 1642 (23. 7 %) patients with <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> were studied. Of these, 97. 7 % resulted from interpersonal violence (homicide) and 2. 3 % were self-inflicted (suicide). Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 2. 2 : 1. Their median age was 24 years. The majority of injuries (53. 5 %) occurred at home. Criminal violence was the most common reason for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> accounting for 52. 1 % of cases. In women, domestic violence was responsible for 64. 6 % of the admissions. Poverty, lack of education, unemployment and alcohol abuse were the most common contributing factors to <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries.</b> Blunt and sharp objects (48. 6 %) were the most common weapons used. Gunshot injuries were recorded in 11. 6 % of cases. The head/neck was commonly affected in 49. 2 %. Soft tissue injuries (87. 3 %) were the most frequent type of injuries.

40|$|Injuries {{constitute}} a {{leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in the world, with <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> and those related to traffic most important, due to their social impact and high prevalence. Although alcohol consumption has been identified as a risk factor for injuries, few studies have assessed risk separately for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> and unintentional injuries caused by traffic, and by other causes. The objective of this paper was to estimate the risk of injuries after acute alcohol consumption for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> and unintentional traffic and non-traffic injuries, using, alternatively, two exposure measures: self-reported drinking prior to the event and blood alcohol concentration. A probability sample was collected of 540 patients from the emergency department of a hospital in Argentina. Logistic regressions were performed, with and without adjusting for gender, age and drinking pattern. Higher risks were found when blood alcohol concentration was used as a measure of consumption, compared to self-report. The highest risk estimates were obtained for <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries,</b> followed by unintentional traffic and, lastly, by unintentional non-traffic injuries. After controlling for confounders, risks for intentional and unintentional traffic injuries appeared similar for those above and below the legal limit. Results point to a significant involvement of alcohol in the regional context. Fil: Cremonte, Mariana. Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata. Facultad de Psicologia; Argentina.

40|$|Objectives We used GBD 2015 {{findings}} {{to measure the}} burden of <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 1990 and 2015. Methods The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study defines <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries</b> as a combination of self-harm (including suicide), interpersonal violence, collective violence (war), and legal intervention. We estimated number of deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) {{for each type of}} <b>intentional</b> <b>injuries.</b> Results In 2015, 28, 695 individuals (95 % UI: 25, 474 – 37, 832) died from self-harm, 35, 626 (95 % UI: 20, 947 – 41, 857) from interpersonal violence, and 143, 858 (95 % UI: 63, 554 – 223, 092) from collective violence and legal interventions. In 2015, collective violence and legal intervention was the fifth-leading cause of DALYs in the EMR and the leading cause in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya; they account for 49. 7 % of total DALYs in Syria.
