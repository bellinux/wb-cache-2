Review of carotid angiograms in 26 patients with internal carotid artery occlusive disease revealed anterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> to ophthalmic <b>artery</b> anastomoses in 16 cases. This route of collateral blood flow was associated in most instances with total occlusion of the cervical portion of the internal carotid artery.

The temporalis myofascial flap is based on two dominant arterial pedicles containing the anterior and posterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The advantages of this flap in TMJ reconstruction include its autogenous origin, adequate blood supply, and {{close proximity to the}} TMJ without the need for additional surgery. When the disc is removed, the flap can simulate physiologic action of the disc. In addition, there is minimal functional morbidity or esthetic deformity at the donor site [9, 10].

40|$|Knowledge as to {{the blood}} supply of the human temporalis muscle is limited to its extramuscular path and relations, little {{information}} existing about the intramuscular vascular architecture. To investigate the 3 -dimensional vascular network in the human temporalis muscle, in 5 fresh cadavers an infusion of methylmethacrylate resin was made via the carotid vessels with subsequent removal of the organic tissues by a corrosion process. The vascular corrosion casts of the temporalis muscle were studied by stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In 6 well perfused muscle specimens, the temporalis muscle {{was found to be}} consistently supplied by 3 arteries: the anterior and posterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries,</b> and the middle temporal artery. Each primary artery branched into the secondary arterioles and then terminal arterioles. The venous network accompanied the arteries, and double veins pairing a single artery was a common finding. Arteriovenous anastomosis was absent, whereas arterioarterial and venovenous anastomoses were common. The capillaries formed a dense interlacing network with an orientation along the muscle fibres.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{application}} of the temporalis muscle flap and its modifications, understanding of the vascular pattern and territories within the muscle remains poor. This study aimed to evaluate the vascular architecture in the human temporalis muscle for surgical application. The material comprised 15 fresh cadavers (30 muscle specimens), which were divided into three groups for vascular infusion by either Indian ink solution, lead oxide solution, or methylmethacrylate resin. The vascular network in the temporalis muscle was analyzed by stereomicroscopy, radiography, and scanning electron microscopy. The human temporalis muscle {{was found to have}} vascular supply from three primary arteries: the anterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> (ADTA), the posterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> (PDTA), and the middle <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> (MTA). Each primary artery branched into the secondary arterioles and then the terminal arterioles. The venous network accompanied the arteries, and double veins pairing one artery was a common finding. The capillaries formed a dense, interlacing network with orientation along the muscle fibres. Arteriovenous anastomosis was absent. In the coronal plane, the vessels were located mainly on the lateral and medial aspects of the muscle with a significantly lower vascular density in the midline. Morphometric analysis of the arterial network showed that the PDTA was larger in size at primary and secondary branching levels than the ADTA and the MTA, whereas no differences were present at the terminal arteriolar levels. The distribution of the arterial territories was as follows: the ADTA occupied 21 % anteriorly, the PDTA occupied 41 % in the middle region, and the MTA occupied 38 % in the posterior region. This improved understanding of the vascular architecture within the temporalis muscle complements the anatomic basis of the flap-splitting technique and increases the safety of its application. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Branches of {{the first}} mandibular part of the MA sit between the initial mandibular part and the {{posterior}} part of LPM. They include the auricular artery deep to the external acoustic meatus, the tympanic artery anterior to the tympanic membrane, the middle meningeal artery (MMA) to the dura mater (with calvaria), the accessory meningeal artery to the cranial cavity, and the alveolar artery inferior to the mandibular gingiva and teeth. The {{second part of the}} MA is the pterygoid portion between LPM and PPF. It mainly serves the masticatory muscles and includes the masseteric <b>artery,</b> <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery,</b> pterygoid branch, and buccal artery. The third pterygopalatine part comprises a short course in the PPF, from the sphenopalatine artery to the sphenopalatine foramen.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{three-dimensional}} images of the arterial supply to the temporomandibular joint. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (five men and five women, mean age 36 years) without signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders, who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning with intravenous contrast, were studied. The direct volume rendering technique of CT images was used, and a data set of images to visualize the vasculature of the human temporomandibular joint in three dimensions was created. After elaboration of the data through post-processing, the arterial supply of the temporomandibular joint was studied. Results: The analysis revealed the superficial <b>temporal</b> <b>artery,</b> the anterior tympanic <b>artery,</b> the <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery,</b> the auricular posterior artery, the transverse facial artery, the middle meningeal artery, and the maxillary artery with their branches as the main arterial sources for the lateral and medial temporomandibular joint. Conclusion: The direct volume rendering technique was found to be successful in the assessment of the arterial supply to the temporomandibular joint. The superficial <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> and maxillary artery ran along the lateral and medial sides of the condylar neck, suggesting that these arteries are at increased risk during soft-tissue procedures such as an elective arthroplasty of the temporomandibular joint...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The infratemporal fossa (ITF) is a {{continuation}} of the temporal fossa between the internal surface of the zygoma and the external surface of the temporal bone and greater wing of the sphenoid bone that is sitting deep to the ramus of the mandible. The principal structure to understanding its relationships is the lateral pterygoid muscle. Other important structures are the medial pterygoid muscle, the maxillary artery, the pterygoid venous plexus, the otic ganglion, the chorda tympani nerve and the mandibular nerve. In this study, we describe the microsurgical anatomy of the ITF, as viewed by step-by-step anatomical dissection and also through the perspective of three lateral approaches and one anterior surgical approach. Methods: Eight cadaver specimens were dissected. In one side of all specimens, an anatomical dissection was done in which a wide preauricular incision from the neck on the anterior border of the sternoclidomastoid muscle {{at the level of the}} cricoid cartilage to the superior temporal line was made. The flap was displaced anteriorly and the structures of the neck were dissected followed by a zygomatic osteotomy and dissection of the ITF structures. On the other side were the surgical approaches to the ITF. The combined infratemporal and posterior fossa approach was done in two specimens, the subtemporal preauricular infratemporal fossa approach in two, the zygomatic approach in two, and the lateral transantral maxillotomy in two. The anatomical dissections were documented on the three-dimensional (3 D) anaglyphic method to produce stereoscopic prints. Results: The lateral pterygoid muscle is one of the principal structures to enable understanding of the relationships into the ITF. The tendon of the temporal muscle inserts in the coronoid process at the ITF. The maxillary artery is the terminal branch of the external carotid artery that originates at the neck of the mandible and runs into the parotid gland. In our dissections the maxillary artery was lateral to the buccal, lingual, and inferior alveolar nerves. We found the second part of the maxillary artery superficial to the lateral pterygoid muscle in all specimens The anterior and posterior branches of the <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> supply the <b>temporal</b> muscle. In two cases we found a middle <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> The different approaches that we used provided different views of the same anatomical landmarks and this provides not only safer surgery but also the best choice to approach the ITF according with the pathology extension. Conclusions: The ITF is a complex region on the skull base that is affected by benign and malignant tumors. The study through different routes is helpful to disclose the relationship among the anatomical structures. Although the authors have shown four approaches, there are a variety of approaches and even a combination of these can be used. This type of anatomical knowledge is essential to choosing the best approach to treat lesions in this area...|$|R
40|$|Various {{authors have}} {{described}} the anatomical variations of the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, especially regarding {{their relationship with the}} lateral pterygoid muscle. However, researchers have been mostly interested in the prevalence of its trajectory, leaving aside the variations of its collateral branches, which determine various vascular territories. The objective of this work is to quantify the temporoalveolar trunk (TAT) of the deep variety of the maxillary artery from an anatomic-topographical description taking into account the neurovascular relationships, the origin of the collateral branches and its regional distribution pattern. In order to achieve our objective, 50 adult cadaveric pieces have been used, which were preserved in formol at 5 % v/v. No exclusion criteria were used to select the pieces. The maxillary arteries were dissected with microsurgical instruments performing a transmadibular approach, which allowed to trespass to the infratemporal fossa. The findings obtained from the dissection of the cadaveric pieces were: in most pieces of the deep variety of the maxillary artery, a common trunk between the posterior <b>deep</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> and the inferior alveolar artery has been identified: the temporoalveolar trunk (TAT), from which we have described two variants, one being complete and the other, incomplete. The existence of the TAT, with its corresponding varieties, substantially modifies the vascular relationships of the region, grouping various branches to a unique origin.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Understanding the {{vascular}} {{variability of}} the inferior temporal occipital regions {{is essential for}} microsurgical approaches to this cerebral zone. To this end, we carried out a microanatomical study of the inferior temporal cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in order to define their vascularisation territories. METHODS: We studied 40 cerebral hemispheres (20 brains) under an operating microscope. Three brains were fixed in Winkler's solution with latex arterial perfusion and the other 17 brains were fixed in formaldehyde solution. RESULTS: Our revised classification {{was based on the}} following findings. First, the anterior hippocampal artery was always associated with the anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery,</b> with the two sharing the vascularisation of the anterior part of the inferior temporal lobe. Second, the middle hippocampal and middle <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> were never present together. Third, the presence of an anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> always involved the presence of a posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> Hence, we classified the temporal branches of the PCA into three new patterns. The first pattern includes the anterior and posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> without the anterior hippocampal artery. The second pattern includes the anterior hippocampal artery and anterior and posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The third pattern includes the common <b>temporal</b> <b>artery.</b> The first pattern was found most frequently (n =  23, 57. 5 %), followed by the second (n =  9, 22. 5 %) and third patterns (n =  8, 20 %).
