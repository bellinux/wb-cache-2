40|$|Micro bores {{are used}} for several high-precision applications, {{especially}} in hydraulic systems and fuel injectors. In this case the shape, particularly the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> of the injection spray hole, has a significant influence on the atomization of fluids and therefore also on the combustion process [1]. Usually these micro bores are machined by electrical discharge machining (EDM) [2]. In EDM sharp edges occur due to the process characteristics and a specific influence on the edge shape is not possible. Thus, a specific and independent adjustment of the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> is required. To produce such a defined <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> of bores, an Electrochemical Machining (ECM) process has been investigated. This process {{is based on a}} localized anodic dissolution of the sample material that is connected to a positive electric potential. The advantages of this process lie in the possible high localization of the erosion process and high achievable surface quality. The tool which is the cathode has a negative potential and determined by the design of the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> [3]. An experimental set-up was developed in order to perform the investigations. This paper presents the setup and experimental investigations...|$|R

50|$|Mansar {{lake was}} built about 1090 by Minaldevi, {{the mother of}} Siddhraj Jaisinh. Formerly known as Mansarovar, now {{shortened}} into Mansar or Munsar lake is 220 yards round, shaped like the conch and is surrounded by flights of stone steps. Gathering from the west, the water passes into a stone-built eightsided silt-well, kund, with, in a niche in each side, a figure cut in bold relief. From the silt-well, through a stone-lined channel and a three-cylinder tunnel, the water passes into the lake. Over the tunnel is a large pyramid-roofed pavilion repaired by the Marathas, and made a temple of Bahuchar Mata, or, as she is locally called, Mansar Mata. Towards the north the steps round the lake are ruinous, and in several places broken roadways run down to the water's <b>edge.</b> <b>Round</b> {{the top of the}} steps runs a row of small spire-roofed shrines, many now wanting but once said to have numbered more than 300. In each shrine on one side of the lake is a pedestal, probably for an image of Krishna, and on the other side a round basin, jaladhar, probably sacred to Shiva. On either hand of one of the roadways that run to the water's edge, is a larger temple with double porch and spire and across the lake a flat roofed colonnade.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The present {{environmental}} issues have made aircraft jet noise reduction a crucial problem in aero-acoustics research. Acoustic studies reveal that addition of chevrons to the nozzle reduces the {{sound pressure level}} reasonably with acceptable reduction in performance. In this paper comprehensive numerical studies on acoustic characteristics {{of different types of}} chevron nozzles have been carried out with non-reacting flows for the shape optimization of chevrons in supersonic nozzles for aerospace applications. The numerical studies have been carried out using a validated steady 3 D density based, k-ε turbulence model. In this paper chevron with sharp edge, flat <b>edge,</b> <b>round</b> edge and U-type edge are selected for the jet acoustic characterization of supersonic nozzles. We observed that compared to the base model a case with round-shaped chevron nozzle could reduce 4. 13 % acoustic level with 0. 6 % thrust loss. We concluded that the prudent selection of the chevron shape will enable an appreciable reduction of the aircraft jet noise without compromising its overall performance. It is evident from the present numerical simulations that k-ε model can predict reasonably well the acoustic level of chevron supersonic nozzles for its shape optimization...|$|E

40|$|Blanking of {{sheet metal}} is an {{important}} forming process in the automotive industry for the manufacture of mechanical components. The final component shape, obtained {{at the end of}} bending or deep-drawing processes, often has sharp edges due to the blanking operation. Concerning passenger safety components, like seat belt anchors, <b>rounding</b> of the <b>edges</b> by punching is necessary to avoid cutting the belt material. In addition to removing the sharp edges, the punching results in work hardening of the material in the rounded zones which results in an increase in the local resistance of the material. In this study, a high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA S 500 MC) has been tested with the aim of quantifying the blanking and <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> operations. The mechanical behaviour of test specimens is investigated by means of tensile tests and the material is characterised in terms of Vickers micro-hardness. Numerical simulations of the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> process are developed using previously identified material behaviour laws. The residual stress fields are characterised and compared to experimental results. This is done so that numerical simulation can be done in the future to prediction the in-service behaviour of the component. Specimens with <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> are compared to specimens that were not submitted to the rounding operation. It is shown that <b>Edge</b> <b>Rounding</b> by Punching improves the component resistance, therefore justifying the use of this process in the manufacture of automotive safety components...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMicro bores {{are used}} for several high-precision applications, {{especially}} in hydraulic systems and fuel injectors. In this case the shape, particularly the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> of the injection spray hole, has a significant influence on the atomization of fluids and therefore also on the combustion process [1]. From the present knowledge {{about the relationship between}} bore geometry and hydraulic properties requirements were derived which are not feasible applying conventional manufacturing techniques. In particular, it is currently not possible to adjust the flow coefficient and the cavitation point independent of each other. The flow coefficient significantly influences the atomization, while the cavitation is necessary to prevent coking of the injection holes. One way to decouple the flow coefficient and cavitation behavior is a functional <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> of the borehole. This cannot be represented by the previous ly applied hydroerosive rounding. Therefore inverse Jet Electrochemical Machining (inverse Jet -ECM) opens up new possibilities, as the erosion area is localised by the jet. In Jet -ECM the electrolyte is supplied through a nozzle at an average speed of about 20 m/s and adjusted perpendicular to the work piece surface. Forming a free jet leads to a high localization of the current density resulting in a much localized machining area direct below the nozzle [2]. In this study an <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> of the micro nozzle bore is realized by an inversion of the Jet-ECM principle...|$|R

40|$|For several high-precision applications, {{especially}} in hydraulic systems and fuel injectors, micro bores are needed. In {{most cases the}} shape of the injection hole, especially the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding,</b> has a significant influence on the atomization fluids and therefore on the combustion process [1]. Usually these micro bores are machined by electrical discharge machining (EDM) [2]. Due to the process characteristics of EDM sharp edges arise and a specific influence on t edge shape is not possible. For this reason a specific adjustment of the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> is required. Therefore an Electrochemical Machining (ECM) process has been developed in cooperation of Chemnitz University of Technology and Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, SITEC Industrietechnologie GmbH and Continental Automotive GmbH [3]. To characterize the process of the electrochemical finishing of micro bores several models have been developed with COMSOL Multiphysics. In the first model the coupling between the application mode electric current and deformed geometry was applied to investigate the erosion process. By help of this model the machined geometry after a processing time of 1 s could be simulated. In a more complex model the non-isothermal fluid ow was anal. It could be observed that the temperature distribution has a less influence on t electrical conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore also on the current density, which determines the <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> process. Selected results of the simulations are validated with experimental ones...|$|R
