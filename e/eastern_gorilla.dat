50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>gorillas</b> live in stable, {{cohesive}} family groups, led by {{a dominant}} silverback male. <b>Eastern</b> <b>gorillas</b> tend to have larger group sizes than their western relatives, numbering up to 35 individuals. There is no distinct breeding season and females give birth only once every 3-4 years due to the long period of parental care and a gestation period of 8.5 months. Newborn gorillas have greyish-pink skin and can crawl after 9 weeks; they are not fully weaned until 3.5 years. Males defend their females and offspring using their large size in intimidating displays involving charging and chest-beating.|$|R

50|$|Four {{species of}} Great Apes (Hominidae) are endemic to Africa: both species of gorilla (western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla,</b> Gorilla beringei) and both species of {{chimpanzee}} (common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and bonobo, Pan paniscus). Humans and their ancestors originated in Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{is a large}} hominid with a large head, broad chest, {{and long}} arms. It has a flat nose with large nostrils. The face, hands, feet and breast are bald. The fur is mainly black, but adult males have a silvery [...] "saddle" [...] on their back. When the gorilla gets older, {{the hair on the}} saddle of the back becomes white, much like the gray hair of elderly people. This is why the older males are called silverbacks. Grauer's gorilla has a shorter, thicker, deep black fur, while the {{mountain}} gorilla has a more bluish color. The mountain gorilla is slightly smaller and lighter than Grauer's gorilla, but still larger and heavier than the western lowland gorilla and the Cross River gorilla. Males are much larger than females. A full-grown adult male <b>Eastern</b> <b>gorilla</b> typically weighs 140 - 205.5 kg and stands 1.7 m upright and a female typically weighs 90 - 100 kg and stands 1.5 m tall. The tallest silverback recorded was a 1.94 m individual shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. The heaviest gorilla recorded was a 1.83 m silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon which weighed about 266 kg, although the latter area is within the range of the western gorilla, far outside that of the <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla beringei) is a {{critically}} endangered {{species of the}} genus Gorilla and the largest living primate. At present, the species is subdivided into two subspecies. Grauer's gorilla, {{formerly known as the}} eastern lowland gorilla (G. b. graueri) is more populous, at about 3,800 individuals. The mountain gorilla (G. b. beringei) has only about 880 individuals. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature mentioned illegal hunting in its assessment of threats to the species.|$|E
50|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla,</b> Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii).

40|$|Gorillas, {{like all}} {{non-human}} great apes, are endangered. Understanding {{the distribution of}} genetic diversity across their range is important because low diversity may arise in small populations through increased inbreeding, and, by reducing reproductive fitness, may lead to decreased chances of persistence of a given population. Previous studies found higher genetic diversity in the western (Gorilla gorilla) than in the <b>eastern</b> <b>gorillas</b> (Gorilla beringei), but rarely employed individuals of known geographic origin to investigate the distribution of diversity across multiple populations. The present study fills that gap by analyzing 1, 161 individuals from nine sites across all four currently recognizedGorilla subspecies. Genetic diversity at each site was estimated using published data from seven highly-variable microsatellite loci. We found that the small and fragmented populations of Cross River <b>gorillas,</b> <b>eastern</b> lowland <b>gorillas</b> and mountain gorillas were less diverse {{than any of the}} five analyzed western lowland gorilla populations. The higher levels of genetic variation within the western lowland gorillas might be best explained by the facts that they (i) exhibit larger present and past effective population sizes than the other subspecies and (ii) maintain higher rates of gene flow through the existence of largely continuous habitat within their range. With regard to conservation, the high genetic diversity within western lowland gorillas is encouraging and retention of dispersal corridors between already protected areas is essential. Am. J.

50|$|Conservationists have {{particularly}} {{worried about}} primates. The Congo is inhabited by several great ape species: the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), the bonobo (Pan paniscus), the <b>eastern</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla beringei), {{and possibly the}} western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). It {{is the only country}} in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee, the bonobo and the gorilla, each of whose populations once numbered in the millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 gorillas, 100,000 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 bonobos. Gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos are all classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union, as well as the okapi, which is also native to the area.|$|E
50|$|Western gorillas are {{generally}} lighter colored than <b>eastern</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Western lowland gorillas have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey fur with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average 155 cm in height, while mature females average 135 cm, weights of wild individuals have been rarely taken but captive western gorillas average 157 kg in males and 80 kg in females. The Cross River gorilla {{differs from the}} western lowland gorilla in both skull and tooth dimensions.|$|R
50|$|The {{great apes}} are large, {{tailless}} primates, {{with the smallest}} living species being the bonobo at 30-40 kilograms in weight, and the largest being the <b>eastern</b> <b>gorillas,</b> with males weighing 140-180 kilograms. In all great apes, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the females, although the degree of sexual dimorphism varies greatly among species. Although most living species are predominantly quadrupedal, they are all able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials, and, in some cases, for tool use.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary cause}} {{of the decline in}} <b>eastern</b> lowland <b>gorilla</b> populations is {{poaching}} for meat. Other reasons for killing gorillas are: instances of killing gorillas as revenge for confiscation of illegal charcoal or other law enforcement, or the destruction of gorilla habitat as a result of logging, charcoal, agricultural expansion or mining. Widespread artisanal mining activities (often controlled by rebel militias) are the major source of hunting pressure for gorillas and other wildlife. <b>Eastern</b> lowland <b>gorilla</b> is also experiencing a range reduction due to an expanding human population.|$|R
