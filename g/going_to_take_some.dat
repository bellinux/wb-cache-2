The title track, a cover of a song on Leon Russell's debut album, was considered as a single, but rejected owing to its length. The album also included a Carole King song, [...] "It's <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>Take</b> <b>Some</b> Time" [...] and another Nichols / Williams original, [...] "I Won't Last A Day Without You". Another Carpenter / Bettis composition, [...] "Top of the World", was originally intended as just an album cut, but after Lynn Anderson scored a hit with the song in early 1973, the Carpenters opted to record their own single version. It was released in September and became the Carpenters' second Billboard No.1 hit, in December.|$|E

Uber cited an example of the aftermath of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden when pricing was increased. During this event, {{the number of people who}} opened the Uber app increased 400%, but, due to the higher prices, the actual ride requests only rose slightly, enabling ride requests to be completed within the usual timeframe.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on August 7, Rodriguez {{announced}} that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor. [...] The club commemorated Rodriguez' final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a [...] "raucous ovation" [...] from the fans. [...] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. On August 15, many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Rodriguez, “I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It’s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to relax and hang with his family and friends.” Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a [...]200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.|$|E

On the Count's side people were asking what Checco meant to do, whether the ovation he had received would encourage him to any violent step. All the world was agog for great events--and nothing happened. It reminded me of a mystery play in which, after great preparation of dialogue, some great stage effect is going to be produced--a saint is going to ascend to heaven, or a mountain is to open and the devil spring out. The spectators are sitting open-mouthed; the moment has come, everything is ready, the signal is given; the mob have already drawn their breath for a cry of astonishment--and something goes wrong and nothing happens.|$|E

5000|$|Lavillenie {{claimed the}} men's world record with 6.16 m on 15 February 2014. Competing {{in the annual}} Pole Vault Stars meeting in Sergey Bubka's {{hometown}} of Donetsk, Ukraine, Lavillenie entered the competition at 5.76 m and cleared that height as well as 5.91 m on his first attempts before needing all three tries to get over 6.01 m (19' 8-1/2"). With the bar set at 6.16 m (20' 2-1/2") and Bubka looking on from the stands, Lavillenie flew over the bar on his first try. 6.16 m is the new absolute world record, exceeding both Bubka's 6.14 m outdoors and 6.15 m indoors that some had considered impossible to beat. It was Lavillenie's fourth consecutive win in the Pole Vault Stars meeting, and came one week short of 21 years since Bubka set the record of 6.15 m at that competition in 1993. [...] "It is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>some</b> time <b>to</b> come back to earth because it is incredible," [...] Lavillenie said. [...] "This is a world record that is so mythical, and to clear it on the first jump, without touching (the bar) - {{there is nothing to}} say. It is just a moment to savor." [...] Holding {{his head in his hands}} in disbelief, Lavillenie looked wild-eyed and then pumped his arms in delight, before running with his arms outstretched to soak up the atmosphere. The vault occurred in Ukraine's fifth largest city just three days before the beginning of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. After a lengthy delay due to the official measurement of the world record 6.16m, Lavillenie had the bar raised 5 cm to 6.21 m (20' 4-1/2"). On his first attempt, he could not control the pole after planting it in the box - the pole pushed him backwards and as he fell off the elevated runway the spikes of his right shoe lacerated the inside of his left ankle that was on the edge of the runway. Fortunately, Lavillenie did not suffer any damage to his ankle ligament or bone. He was given 16 stitches in a Donetsk hospital to close his ankle wound. Although not a serious injury, the nearly 4-inch long gash put an immediate end to Lavillenie's indoor season, forcing him to withdraw from both the Championnats de France d'athlétisme en salle (the French national indoor athletics championships) to be held in Bordeaux on 22-23 February and the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships to be held in Sopot, Poland on 7-9 March. Lavillenie was given a hero's welcome when he landed home on 16 February, showing up in the Charles de Gaulle Airport terminal building in crutches before a horde of journalists. The new world record holder arrived home to an outpouring of praise from all quarters in a country where pole-vaulting is held in the highest esteem. [...] "The New Czar," [...] headlined the L'Équipe sports daily, saying that his giant leap in Ukraine had been [...] "a major landmark in the history of sport." [...] Lavillenie's compatriot, Jean Galfione, who won the 1996 Olympic pole vault gold medal, said, [...] "Doing better than Bubka, it is like going faster than Usain Bolt, having better statistics than Michael Jordan. He has just dethroned a legend." [...] "It was great, a historical moment. It was really an incredible performance. I am very happy that I passed the baton to such a great athlete and such a great personality and role model. I always felt it could happen. I hoped it would be soon," [...] Sergey Bubka, who was the first person to congratulate Lavillenie on his world record-breaking performance, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview shortly after Lavillenie had claimed the world record. On 9 March - on the last day of the 2014 World Indoor Championships, the IAAF announced that it had ratified (certified) his world record jump.|$|R

60|$|The loving {{couple were}} thus loving {{all the way}} to Twickenham, but when we arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. Leaver threw stones at Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Leaver ran after Mrs. Leaver on the grass, in a most {{innocent}} and enchanting manner. At dinner, too, Mr. Leaver WOULD steal Mrs. Leaver's tongue, and Mrs. Leaver WOULD retaliate upon Mr. Leaver's fowl; and when Mrs. Leaver was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> lobster salad, Mr. Leaver wouldn't let her have any, saying that it made her ill, and she was always sorry for it afterwards, which afforded Mrs. Leaver an opportunity of pretending to be cross, and showing many other prettinesses. But this was merely the smiling surface of their loves, not the mighty depths of the stream, down to which the company, to say the truth, dived rather unexpectedly, from the following accident. It chanced that Mr. Leaver took upon himself to propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion of that entertainment, in doing which, he affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself, and pretended grievously to lament his fallen state. This Mrs. Leaver's feelings could not brook, even in jest, and consequently, exclaiming aloud, 'He loves me not, he loves me not!' she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of Mrs. Starling, and, directly becoming insensible, was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room. Presently Mr. Leaver came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in company, and as there was, (in what company is there not?) both Mr. Leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away together.|$|E
