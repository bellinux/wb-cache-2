5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory {{conscription}} was abolished in January 2008. Until 2008 {{military service}} was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> scheme of nine-month conscription tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service.|$|E

50|$|Komba is an extinct genus of galagos, {{containing}} species known <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> {{to middle}} Miocene of Kenya and Uganda. A new species, K. walkeri, was described <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Miocene of Kenya by Terry Harrison in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, the Rankin-Bass studio, {{the company}} behind the 1977 {{animated}} adaptation of The Hobbit, released The Return of the King in 1980 as {{a sequel to}} The Hobbit, but also completing the story begun in Bakshi's film by adapting the final novel, though the Rankin-Bass production offers no stylistic continuation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Cathedral {{began as}} a parish church and was re-founded as a {{religious}} college in 1422, much of its structure being designed by John Wastell (1485 to 1506). It is very different in style <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> great churches, sometimes being listed with the 13 Anglican 'parish-church cathedrals'. Double aisles give it the widest nave of any English cathedral (115feet); and {{it also has the}} richest set of late medieval choir stalls and misericords in the country.|$|E
50|$|Phalangiotarbi (Haase, 1890) is an extinct {{arachnid}} order {{first recorded}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Devonian of Germany and most {{widespread in the}} Upper Carboniferous coal measures of Europe and North America.

50|$|The churchyard wall, {{which dates}} partly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 18th century and partly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 20th century, is listed at Grade II. It {{consists}} of a red brick wall with simple wrought iron gates. On the gate piers are ball finials.|$|R
5|$|Recovery {{efforts were}} {{extensive}} following the storm's passage. The Government of India allocated ₹3 billion (US$69.3 million) to the Odishan state government, supplementing earlier contributions made towards relief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> cyclone. Various {{branches of the}} Indian Armed Forces were dispatched to aid the recovery efforts. Contributions from foreign governments amounted to nearly US$13million, with a majority allocated by the United States. Alongside foreign and domestic government contributions, between 12–14 international aid agencies concurrently participated in relief efforts in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|Season one aired between March 24 and April 26, 2005. It {{originally}} debuted as a midseason {{replacement for}} Committed. It carried over general plot ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, {{and particularly the}} threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only the pilot was a direct adaptation {{of one of the}} UK version's episodes.|$|E
5|$|Sony {{announced}} on April 2, 2012 {{that the three}} films would be re-released on June 12, 2012. The DVDs {{of the first two}} films reinstated a selection of the bonus features missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Blu-ray releases, although the Spider-Man 3 reissue did not include the bonus disc of additional special features that appeared on earlier Blu-ray releases.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the well researched Bronze Age settlement, at least three earlier settlements existed at Mörigen. <b>The</b> <b>earliest</b> were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> to <b>the</b> late Neolithic (4th-3rd millennium BC) while <b>the</b> later were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Bronze Age. However, these sites were not well studied and have largely disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Rugby {{football}} was played in Machen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1870s, but Machen RFC {{can be placed}} as playing as a club <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1880s. One of <b>the</b> club's <b>earliest</b> and most notable players was Frank Purdon, who would later go on to play from Newport and Wales.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built of wood in 1669 and rebuilt in 1817 {{to the current}} three-sided choir. During a {{restoration}} in 1910, lumber from a previous wooden church was found <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1200s, partly with fragments of wall paintings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1500s.|$|R
5|$|Test data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research {{since the}} XF-104 would share the general {{design of the}} X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|The Flood's {{design and}} fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who {{utilized}} unused concepts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Bungie game Marathon 2. The ringworld Halo {{was stripped of}} many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-infested space ships for Halo3.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus, {{writing in}} the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides {{an account of the}} Battle of Mykale, derived directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.|$|E

50|$|Gobekko is an extinct genus of gecko or gecko-like lizard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Late Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Gobekko {{is either}} a basal member of Gekkota, the group that {{includes}} geckos and the legless pygopodid lizards, or a stem-gekkotan outside Gekkota but within the larger group Gekkonomorpha. It is the fourth oldest known member of Gekkonomorpha after Hoburogekko, a gecko <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Cretaceous of Mongolia, AMNH FR21444, an unnamed specimen also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Cretaceous of Mongolia, and Cretaceogekko, a gecko preserved in amber <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Cretaceous of Burma.|$|R
5000|$|The family Chanidae is {{subdivided}} into two subfamilies, the Rubiesichthyinae, which comprises of the extinct genera †Gordichthys, †Nanaichthys and †Rubiesichthys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Cretaceous, and <b>the</b> Chaninae which comprises the sole extant genus Chanos and the extinct genera †Dastilbe, †Parachanos and †Tharrhias, also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Cretacaeous.|$|R
5|$|The root mil in million {{does not}} refer to the numeral, 1. The word, million, derives from the Old French, milion, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Old Italian, milione, an {{intensification}} of the Latin word, mille, a thousand. That is, a million is a big thousand, much as a great gross is a dozen gross or 12×144 = 1728.|$|E
5|$|The {{table of}} {{characteristics}} provided by Lt. Jurrien S. Noot for the 19 April 1940 design {{does not give}} any armament specifics, as these likely remained unaltered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main armament of nine 283mm guns, a secondary armament of twelve 120mm dual purpose guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40mmguns and eight Oerlikon 20mmcannons.|$|E
5|$|USS Theodore Roosevelt {{and later}} {{carriers}} have slight structural differences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the {{high-strength low-alloy steel}} (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E
