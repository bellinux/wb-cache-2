40|$|The {{construction}} industry, {{being one}} of the largest industrial sectors in Canada, has been continually searching for automated methods that can be adopted to monitor the productivity, consistency, quality and safety of its construction work. The automated recognition of construction operational resources (equipment, workers, materials etc.) has {{played a significant role in}} achieving the full automation in monitoring and control of the construction sites. Considering that construction equipment is one of the main operational resources in executing construction tasks, this research work is focused on automated recognition of such equipment from on-site images. In order to achieve this, it is first necessary to evaluate the construction equipment recognition performances of existing object recognition methods. The currently available object recognition datasets that are used to validate the existing recognition methods contain only limited categories of objects, where construction equipment are not included. As a result, it is unclear whether these methods could be used to recognize construction equipment from on-site images, especially considering that construction sites are typically dirty, disorderly, and cluttered. To fill this gap, this research work proposes to create a standardized dataset of construction equipment images that can be used to measure the construction equipment recognition performances of existing object recognition methods. Almost 2, 000 images have been collected and compiled to create the dataset, which covers 5 common classes of construction equipment (<b>excavator,</b> <b>loader,</b> tractor, compactor and backhoe loader). Each image has been annotated with information concerning the equipment class, identity, location, orientation, occlusion, and labeling of equipment components (bucket, stick, boom etc.). The effectiveness of the dataset has been tested on two common object recognition methods in computer vision. The recognition tests imply that the recognition methods can be adopted comprehensively for the recognition of construction equipment with the dataset developed in this research. The performances of these two methods are further compared on the basis of the recognition tests conducted in this work. The results show that the construction equipment recognition performance of existing object recognition methods can be evaluated with the dataset in a standard, unbiased, and extensive way...|$|E

The goal of the novel architecture is to actively use pressure drops usually wasted in the local compensators and, in case of assistive or overrunning loads, dissipated over control valves...|$|R

40|$|Keywords- hybrid excavator; {{potential}} energy recovery; arm; energy saving Environmental and energy issues demand the construction equipment industry {{to develop more}} efficient and energy saving machines as they have done to the automotive industry in the last decade.

Heavy earth moving equipments such as <b>excavators,</b> <b>loaders</b> and forklift trucks have unique power train mechanism, thus the focus on important issues like efficiency improvement or energy savings holds great value.

In this context, hybrid excavators have been ushered in currently. Here system translates the arm/boom/buck’s {{potential energy}} into electrical energy and then the electrical energy is stored in a storage device.

40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the assessment of on-site fuel consumption and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions due to earthworks-related processes in residential building projects, {{prior to the start}} of the construction phase. Several studies have been carried out on this subject, and have demonstrated the considerable environmental impact of earthworks activities in terms of fuel consumption. However, no methods have been proposed to estimate on-site fuel consumption during the planning stage. This paper presents a quantitative method to predict fuel consumption before the construction phase. The calculations were based on information contained in construction project documents and the definition of equipment load factors. Load factors were characterized for the typical equipment that is used in earthworks in residential building projects (<b>excavators,</b> <b>loaders</b> and compactors), taking into considering the type of soil, the type of surface and the duration of use. We also analyzed transport fuel consumption, because of its high impact in terms of pollution. The proposed method was then applied to a case study that illustrated its practical use and benefits. The predictive method can be used as an assessment tool for residential construction projects, to measure the environmental impact in terms of on-site fuel consumption. Consequently, it provides a significant basis for future methods to compare construction projects. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
