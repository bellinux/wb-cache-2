Chelating agents are added to soil to solubilize the metals for enhanced phytoextraction. Yet no studies follow the displacement and leaching of heavy metals in soil with and without roots following solubilization with chelates. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} mobility of heavy metals in biosolids applied to the surface of soil columns (76 cm long; 17 cm diam.) with or without plants (barley; Hordeum vulgare L.). Three weeks after barley was planted, all columns were irrigated with the disodium salt of the chelating agent, EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) (0. 5 g/kg soil). Drainage water, soil, and plants were analyzed for heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). Total concentrations of the heavy metals in all columns {{at the end of the}} experiment generally were lower in the top 30 cm of soil with EDTA than without EDTA. The chelate increased concentrations of heavy metals in shoots. With or without plants, the EDTA mobilized Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, which leached to drainage water. Drainage water from columns without EDTA had concentrations of these heavy metals below detection limits. Only Cu did not leach in the presence of EDTA. Even though roots retarded the movement of Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn through the EDTA-treated soil from 1 <b>d</b> (<b>Cd)</b> <b>to</b> 5 <b>d</b> (Fe), the drainage water from columns with EDTA had concentrations of Cd, Fe, Mn, and Pb that exceeded drinking water standards by 1. 3, 500, 620, and 8. 6 times, respectively. Because the chelate rendered Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn mobile, it is suggested that the theory for leaching of soluble salts, put forward by Nielsen and associates in 1965, could be applied to control movement of the heavy metals for maximum uptake during chelate-assisted phytoremediation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} two smooth {{projective}} curves C 1 and C 2 of genus g which have isomorphic symmetric products are isomorphic unless g = 2. This extends a theorem of Martens. Let k be an algebraically closed field and C 1 and C 2 two smooth projective curves of genus g> 1 over k. It {{is a consequence}} of Torelli’s theorem that if Sym g− 1 C 1 ∼ = Sym g− 1 C 2, then C 1 ∼ = C 2. The same holds for the d’th symmetric products, for 1 ≤ d 1 with Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 1 ∼ = Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 2 for some d ≥ 1. Since the Albanese variety of Sym d Ci, d ≥ 1, is isomorphic to the Jacobian J(Ci), it follows that J(C 1) ∼ = J(C 2). If d ≤ g − 1, the theorem follows immediately from [2], since the image of Sym d Ci in J(Ci) (after choosing a basepoint) is Wd(Ci). Note that in this case it sufices to have a birational isomorphism from Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 1 <b>to</b> Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 2. Suppose g ≤ d ≤ 2 g − 3. Then the Albanese map from Sym <b>d</b> Ci <b>to</b> J(Ci) is surjective with general fibre of dimension d − g. Interpreting the fibres as complete linear systems of degree d on Ci, it follows by Serre duality that the subvariety of J(Ci) over which the fibres are of dimension> d −g is isomorphic to W 2 g− 2 −d(Ci). Therefore if Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 1 ∼ = Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 2, then W 2 g− 2 −d(C 1) ∼ = W 2 g− 2 −d(C 2), so Martens’ theorem implies that C 1 ∼ = C 2. Now suppose that d> 2 g − 2 and g> 2. By choosing some isomorphism we identify J(C 1) and J(C 2) with a fixed abellian variety A. If φ: Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 1 → Sym <b>d</b> <b>C</b> 2 is our given isomorphism, from the universal property of the Albanese morphism we obtain a commutative diagram Sym <b>d</b> <b>C...</b>|$|R

40|$|DIET OF PRE-HISPANIC POTTER VILLAGES IN CENTRAL CHILE THROUGH ISOTOPIC ANALYSES This project {{involves}} {{a study on}} the diet of pre-Hispanic potter villages in Central Chile through the analysis of steady isotopes. These analyses (which in this case included carbon and nitrogen from bone collagen; carbon and oxygen from bone apatite and tooth enamel) are sensitive in differentiating marine from terrestrial diets, plant consumption of C 3 photosynthetic pattern (almost every wild plant and those cultivated in temperate climates) from C 4 (maize), and herbivore diets from carnivore ones. These analyses have the advantage of being able to estimate what each individual consumed, compare the diet of individuals in a same archaeological site, and evaluate differences between the diet of a person as young and as an adult. A total of 103 subjects were analysed, distributed among the different cultural groups of Central Chile: Initial Potter Communities (300 a. <b>C.</b> <b>to</b> 200 <b>d.</b> <b>C.),</b> Bato (20 <b>to</b> 900 <b>d.</b> <b>C.),</b> Llolleo (300 <b>to</b> 1000 <b>d.</b> <b>C.),</b> Aconcagua (100 <b>to</b> 1450 <b>d.</b> <b>C.)</b> and Inca (1450 <b>to</b> 1550 <b>d.</b> <b>C)</b> in the coast and inner valleys. A small sample of archaic groups and Andean groups was analysed as reference. A sample of the main potentially edible resources: sea fauna, lake fauna, guanaco, wild and cultivated plants, were also analysed {{to be used as a}} reference value in estimating human diet. Results indicate that feeding patterns are closely related to the cultural context. During the Archaic period, mainly C 3 plants and terrestrial fauna are consumed. Initial Potter Communities have quinoa horticulture, consume very little meat and have no maize. Bato groups are highly variable and overall they are also strongly dependent on C 3 wild resources. Llolleo groups have clear signs of maize consumption and dietetic differences between inhabitants in the coastal and inner areas, which can be used to establish that they permanently resided in one or the other environment throughout the year. Aconcagua groups consumed proportionally more maize than Llolleo groups, and some of them probably moved around the coast and valleys in the coastal mountain. During the Inca contact times, subjects feature less signs of maize in their bones, which was not expected. This can be due to changes in crops distribution patterns in the local population, as a result of demands by the lords of Tawantinsuyu to be with “chicha” for rituals and inter-personal relations. Differences in feeding patterns between men and women were detected only in the inner Aconcagua population. Groups that had a well consolidated maize horticulture apparently used this resource specially to feed children. It is noteworthy that none of the groups studied, particularly those from the coast, do not include marine resources as a central component of their diet.
