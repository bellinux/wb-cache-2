Still, I know how valuable this son of yours had been to your interests, how dear to your heart, and I cannot tell you, with what deep and sincere grief I heard of your terrible loss." ...|$|E

2500|$|CBS and Warner Bros. {{terminated}} Sheen's {{contract on}} March 7, 2011. He {{was replaced by}} Ashton Kutcher. In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed [...] "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" [...] and stated, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> continue to make great television." [...] In 2012, Sheen returned to television in Anger Management, the spin-off of the movie of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful, my boys. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be brave, if necessary; but {{care and}} caution are the great things, and {{remember}} that our safety depends upon yours." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, hardly that, either," [...] he {{answered}} with hesitation. [...] "There," [...] he continued, [...] "I have said rather more than I should, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not abuse my confidence. Good-bye!" ...|$|R
