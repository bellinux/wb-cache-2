25|$|Using a 1962 De Havilland Caribou as {{a shuttle}} plane, the team {{departed}} the U.S. Armed Services base at Thule and flew in {{tools and equipment}} to the Kee Bird. Over the summer months, the team transported four re-manufactured engines, four new propellers, an <b>engine</b> <b>hoist,</b> and new tires, {{as well as a}} small bulldozer, to the remote site. The team successfully replaced the engines and propellers, mounted the new tires, and resurfaced the aircraft's control surfaces. As the winter snows began to fall, the Chief Engineer, Rick Kriege fell ill and was transported to a hospital in Iqaluit, Canada, where he died from a blood clot two weeks later. Although the plane was nearly ready to fly, Greenamyer's team was compelled by weather to leave the site.|$|E
50|$|An engine crane (also {{referred}} as <b>engine</b> <b>hoist)</b> {{is a common}} repair tool used in vehicle repair shops to remove or install gasoline or diesel engines in small and crowded vehicle engine compartments. It uses a heavy cantilevered support structure to hold the engine in mid-air so that the mechanic can carefully connect or disconnect fragile hoses and wires on the engine to {{the frame of the}} vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The SAE (Society for Automotive Engineers) vehicle {{teams at}} Cal Poly need {{an easy way}} to access the undersides of their {{vehicles}} to facilitate maintenance and servicing. The purpose of this project was to provide a solution that could lift the vehicles effectively and safely from above so that the underside of the vehicles can be accessed, as well as elevating the vehicles to an ergonomic working height. Design specifications were determined based off each vehicle’s requirements in addition to what the team intends to do with their suspended vehicle. After several concept iterations, the team decided to purchase an <b>engine</b> <b>hoist</b> and replace the hydraulic cylinder with a fixed tube and construct a custom transmission thereby turning the <b>engine</b> <b>hoist</b> into a crane mechanism that can be operated easily without concerns of reliability. The team constructed a total of three lifts, each with different specifications, for the Baja, Formula, and F 2000 cars. Material testing was done to verify that the unknown material of the purchased lifts was strong enough to support the loading, as well as final load testing by lifting a vehicle to its designed height...|$|E

50|$|The mine, Orenda Mine #1, {{extracted}} high quality, semi-bituminous coal. A steam <b>engine</b> <b>hoisted</b> {{the coal}} to the surface. The hoist pulled the coal cars up a coal tipple that was 1080 ft long, 92 ft high, and 60 ft wide. In 1920, {{this was the}} largest coal tipple in the world. At its prime, 900 men were employed and over 3,000 tons of coal were mined daily. The company was eventually renamed to the United Coal Company and in 1918 it became the Davis Coal Company.|$|R
2500|$|Seneca then {{instructed}} Tomoka {{that she}} would be sunk by gunfire unless she proceeded toward New York City. The rum-runner started in that direction, but then suddenly started its <b>engine,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the fore staysail and stood rapidly to eastward. Seneca gave chase and opened fire. [...] The first shot was fired across the bow of the fleeing schooner, then the range was gradually decreased. After three warning shots, a fourth shot was fired to hit. The shell landed alongside a few feet from Tomoka, and the schooner immediately stopped engines, hauled down the fore staysail and headed into the wind with her foresail idly flapping.|$|R

50|$|In slope mines, {{where there}} was a {{continuous}} downgrade from the entrance to the working face, the rope from the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> could be used to lower empty cars into the mine and then raise full cars. In shaft mines, secondary <b>hoisting</b> <b>engines</b> could be used to pull cars on grades within the mine. For grades of a few percent, trains of 25 cars each carrying roughly half a ton were typical in the 1880s.|$|R

A comprehensive account of the impact of various factors on the stress-strain state of the rope allows determining the loss of tractive capacity in operation on the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine.</b> The results should be taken into account in the design and operation of hoisting and transporting machines with fl at traction bodies...|$|R
50|$|The coroner's report {{stated that}} the {{engineer}} had lost control because of management's negligence, having failed to properly install a safety device to prevent overwinding. Also, the braking system consisting of disk brakes on the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> had been detached.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] <b>engine</b> could <b>hoist</b> a three car trip, {{equivalent}} to 200 tons in three minutes. After {{a fire in}} 1868, new [...] engines were installed. These were supposedly the most powerful engines in the world, later surpassed only by the engines operating the locks on the Panama Canal. Approximately 800 to 900 railroad cars passed over the plane every twenty-four hours. The Mahanoy Plane ceased operation on February 27, 1932, due to the decline of Anthracite and the much easier route through the Mahanoy Tunnel.|$|R

50|$|On the voyage, the {{friendly}} Antoine acts as chef, {{but the food}} mysteriously disappears from Stan's plate because stowaway Giovanni is taking it. This leads Stan to blame Ollie and an argument ensues. The engine then fails, so Ollie removes parts {{in an attempt to}} fix it. He hands them to Stan, who puts them on the deck where they slide overboard. Ollie then realises that his efforts were in vain when he notices that the fuel gauge reads empty. Having lost the <b>engine,</b> they <b>hoist</b> the sail, revealing Giovanni hiding in it.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the three <b>engines</b> is the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine.</b> It is a double-cylinder {{horizontal}} type with a 12 in bore and 16 in stroke. In addition to powering the hoist, it provided locomotive power and could move the shovel at speeds of a 1/4 mph. About 50 ft of the hoist chain has been removed.Both of the other engines have an 8 in bore. The swing engine, attached to a chain around the swing circle, moves the boom from side to side. The other engine, the boom or crowd engine, raises and lowers the dipper. Due to its exposure to the weather, {{it is no longer}} in working condition. The other two, wholly inside the main section, were more protected from the elements and could be operated with compressed air.|$|R
50|$|Compressed air {{for running}} power drills and for driving fans and small <b>hoisting</b> <b>engines</b> was {{adopted in the}} Comstock mines. Diamond drills for {{drilling}} long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable.

50|$|Small {{scale model}} {{aircraft}} offer increased photographic {{access to these}} previously restricted areas. Miniature vehicles do not replace full size aircraft, as full size aircraft are capable of longer flight times, higher altitudes, and greater equipment payloads. They are, however, useful in any situation in which a full-scale aircraft would be dangerous to operate. Examples would include the inspection of transformers atop power transmission lines and slow, low-level flight over agricultural fields, both {{of which can be}} accomplished by a large-scale radio controlled helicopter. Professional-grade, gyroscopically stabilized camera platforms are available for use under such a model; a large model helicopter with a 26cc gasoline <b>engine</b> can <b>hoist</b> a payload of approximately seven kilograms (15 lbs). In addition to gyroscopically stabilized footage, the use of RC copters as reliable aerial photography tools increased with the integration of FPV (first-person-view) technology. Many radio-controlled aircraft are now capable of utilizing Wi-Fi to stream live video from the aircraft's camera back to the pilot's ground station.|$|R
