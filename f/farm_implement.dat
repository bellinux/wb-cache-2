40|$|Mechanization {{is a key}} to {{agricultural}} productivity growth in developing countries. <b>Farm</b> <b>implements,</b> ranging from hand tools to draft animals to milling machines to power tillers and tractors, often play complementary roles with each other, and supporting adoption of certain <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> may also speed up adoption of others. In the absence of credit, insurance, or information, however, such complementarity may be reduced. This study analyzes how the ownership of particular <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> by Nigerian farmers affected their investment in other <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> under a project that provided matching grants for the acquisition of various types of <b>farm</b> <b>implements.</b> We found that ownership of certain <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> increased farmers' investment in the same implements but reduced their investment in other, potentially complementary, implements. We argue that these effects may be partly explained by high operating and maintenance costs {{associated with the use of}} farm equipment in these countries. Ownership of farm equipment may provide a good indicator of farmers' potential willingness to invest in the same of different farm equipment. At the same time, a public project supporting farmers' investment in farm equipment should provide financial support not only for the acquisition of <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> but also for their operation and maintenance. agricultural mechanization, average treatment effect, complementarity, liquidity constraint, operating cost,...|$|R

2500|$|The {{internal}} war {{for control}} of Japan was won by Tokugawa Ieyasu who defeated his rivals at the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600. Three years later, he established the Tokugawa Shogunate, a powerful entity that would maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in Japan for the following 250 years. This {{is known as the}} Edo period (1603-1868). From the mid 17th century, Japan decided to close itself to interaction with the West as well as its close neighbors of China and Korea through its policy of Sakoku. [...] Contrary to popular belief, this did not lead to Japan [...] "giving up the gun." [...] If anything, the gun was used less frequently because the Edo Period did not have many large-scale conflicts in which a gun would be of use. Often the sword was simply the more practical weapon in the average small-scale conflicts. It {{should also be noted that}} isolation did not decrease the production of guns in Japan—on the contrary, there is evidence of around 200 gunsmiths in Japan by the end of the Edo Period. But the social life of firearms had changed: as the historian David L. Howell has argued, for many in Japanese society, the gun had become less a weapon than a <b>farm</b> <b>implement</b> for scaring off animals. With no external enemies for over 200 years, tanegashima were mainly used by samurai for hunting and target practice, the majority were relegated to the arms store houses of the various feudal lords (daimyo).|$|E
