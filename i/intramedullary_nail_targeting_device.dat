Many other significant co-morbidity and even mortality are associated to this fractures (osteoporosis, malnutrition, decreased physical activity, reduced visual acuity, neurological deficits, asthenia, balance disorders and altered reflexes). Due to osteoporosis, the greater frequency of these fractures occurs to elderly women.

We performed an economic evaluation to compare resource use and effectiveness of reamed and unreamed <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> using a cost-utility analysis. MethodsWe calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each patient from a self-administered health utility index 3 questionnaire for the first 12 months following the <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing.</b> A convenience sample of 235 SPRINT patients provided data on costs associated with health care resource utilization. All costs are reported in Canadian dollars for the 2008 financial year. ResultsWe found incremental effects of − 0. 017 (95 % confidence interval [CI] − 0. 021 – 0. 058) and − 0. 002 (95 % CI − 0. 060 – 0. 062) QALYs for patients treated with reamed compared with unreamed <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nails</b> in closed and open fractures, respectively. The incremental costs for reamed compared with unreamed <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> were $ 51 Canadian dollars (95 % CI −$ 2298 –$ 2400) in closed tibial fractures and $ 2546 Canadian dollars (95 %CI −$ 1773 –$ 6864) in open tibial fractures. Unreamed nailing dominated reamed nailing for both closed and open tibial fractures; however, the cost and the utility results had high variability.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} is to compare <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> with {{external}} fixation for knee arthrodesis after failed infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Primary outcome is radiographic union. Secondary outcomes include recurrent deep infection, revision arthrodesis, and amputation. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes from <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> and external fixation in patients with infected TKA undergoing arthrodesis procedures was performed. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Results <b>Intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> achieves a significantly higher rate of radiographic union compared with external fixation (odds ratio [OR] 5. 17, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 74 - 9. 75, P <. 00001) at a mean follow-up of 44. 22 months. There is no significant difference in the rate of recurrent deep infection (OR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 38 - 2. 15, P =. 83) or amputation (OR 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 23 - 3. 84, P =. 93). The rate of revision arthrodesis procedures is significantly lower for <b>intramedullary</b> <b>nailing</b> compared with external fixation (OR 0. 28, 95 % CI 0. 08 - 0. 93, P =. 04).
