40|$|Summary: Within {{the scope}} of work package 2, two web {{services}} have been developed which allows semantic enrichment and disambiguation of scientific articles as well as mind maps. These services have been named <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> and Disambiguation Service. In the case of scientific articles, which are typically stored as PDF documents, the documents are first parsed, analysed and extracted. Here the PDFs are split into their structure, which allows us to re-create the original table of contents. Furthermore a set of metadata, for example the author names, are extracted. The algorithms, which have been developed to build the <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service,</b> have been evaluated against existing or newly created data-set and the results have been published. The task of the Disambiguation Service is to disambiguate entities discovered by the <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> as well as disambiguate table columns. The results of this work have been published...|$|E

40|$|User {{interactions}} with mobile devices {{can be challenging}} for many reasons including limitations due to input and output capabilities. By leveraging context and using it to facilitate some of the interactions previously initiated by the user, we alleviate the need {{for some of the}} onerous user interactions. In the first part of my workshop presentation, I will present our effort to take a mobile calendar application, that is rich in context information and to use proactive techniques to develop an <b>enrichment</b> <b>service</b> that facilitates user interactions when they are mobile. The service demonstrates that proactive techniques that exploit context can address certain mobile user experience challenges. However, in order to extend the approach more extensively for the mobile calendar application or more generally to other mobile applications, semantic technologies are needed. Thus, the second part of my workshop presentation introduces some early work on mining free-form content in calendar fields for contextual information {{that can be used to}} further enhance mobile user experience. The result of the mining effort is to provide semantic tags for the calendar’s summary, description, and annotations. Once tagged, a variety of semantically related data and functions demonstrated in our <b>enrichment</b> <b>service</b> can then be applied to the tagged content. We examine the challenges with such content...|$|E

40|$|Additional {{services}} for the uranium enrichment cascade process, such as UF{sub 6 } feed, sampling, and material storage are provided by several ancillary Uranium Material Handling (UMH) facilities at the PORTS site. These facilities include the X- 343 Feed Vaporization and Sampling Facility, the X- 744 G Bulk Non-Uranium <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> Activity (UESA) Storage Building, the X- 744 H Waste Separation and Storage Facility, the X- 344 A Toll Enrichment Services Facility and the X- 342 A Feed Vaporization and Fluorine Generation Facility. As uranium operations are performed within these facilities, {{the potential for a}} criticality accident exists. In the event of a criticality accident within a process facility at PORTS, a Criticality Accident Alarm System (CAAS) is in place to detect the criticality accident and sound an alarm. In this report, an analysis was performed to provide verification that the existing CAAS at PORTS provides complete criticality accident coverage in the X- 343, X- 744 G. X- 744 H. X- 344 A and X- 342 A facilities. The analysis has determined that all of the above-mentioned facilities have complete CAAS coverage...|$|E

40|$|As {{the amount}} of content in the {{engineering}} space is constantly growing it {{is becoming more and}} more difficult to retrieve relevant information. In this context the IET has commissioned a project to evaluate the feasibility of providing a semantic <b>enrichment</b> <b>service</b> based on the terms contained in the Inspec Thesaurus. The possibility of automated tagging of a variety of content types including traditional academic publishing data (e. g. journal abstracts), commercial product information (e. g. product catalogues) and social media (e. g. twitter feeds) has been explored as well as the auto generation of new terms for the Inspec thesaurus. We have used recognized semantic data modelling techniques to create a working ontology for a subset of the Inspec thesaurus and then used this ontology to entity extract and tag the names of people, organisations and their locations, along with Inspec thesaurus terms themselves, on all items of content run through the system. In addition we have built a number of applications to test the validity and accuracy of this approach as well as to explore how such a system would cope with the volume of future indexing requirements. We are continually evaluating our approach via on-going market research and user testing...|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} Australia {{could become a}} major {{supplier}} of uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>services,</b> taking a significant step towards establishing multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle as a global norm. Introduction: Australia has the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest uranium reserves—one third of the world total—and {{is part of the}} Asia-Pacific region, the region of largest growth in nuclear power utilisation. Accordingly, Australia seems well placed to become a major supplier of uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>services</b> in the future. This is not simply a commercial issue, but could help advance non-proliferation objectives. Uranium enrichment is a dual-use technology—a country with a national enrichment program has the potential to use this for producing nuclear weapons. Increasing awareness of this proliferation risk has prompted efforts to develop a new international framework for nuclear energy, emphasising international cooperation as an alternative to national fuel cycle programs. A multilaterally-based enrichment centre in Australia, with regional participation, could obviate further national enrichment programs in the region and would be a significant step towards establishing multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle as a global norm...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two fuel banks, the Russian Federation has also established an International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) located at Angarsk. The IUEC is set up as a joint stock company between Russia's Rosatom Corporation holding 80% of the shares, Kazakhstani and Ukrainian corporations, while the government of Armenia slated to join the company in the future. The IUEC differs from the two fuel banks in several important ways. First, it is a for-profit entity owned by state-backed companies. As a result, unlike the fuel banks, it is preferential and exclusive in its provision of <b>enrichment</b> <b>services.</b> The IUEC gives preferential treatment to its shareholders when selling <b>enrichment</b> <b>services,</b> and is only available to states {{that do not have}} domestic enrichment capabilities and perform their obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Like the fuel banks, it provides an alternative to the expensive start-up costs of an indigenous enrichment capacity, but unlike the fuel banks it provides a further financial incentive to its shareholders in the form of dividends.|$|R
