5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back <b>for</b> <b>Christians.</b> The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E

Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment <b>for</b> <b>Christians</b> who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded tightly around the body.

By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as a garment that embodied social unity.|$|E

Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

5|$|Catholicism {{was first}} {{propagated}} in Nepal during the 18th century, though from 1810 to 1950 no missionaries were allowed in Nepal. Since 1951, missionaries have again been allowed, though proselytism has remained illegal, and conversion to Christianity remained illegal until 1990. In 1983 a mission sui iuris covering Nepal was created, and in 1996 it {{was raised to}} an Apostolic Prefecture. The 1990 Nepali constitution did not guarantee religious freedom <b>for</b> <b>Christians,</b> but as of May 2006 Nepal has been declared a secular state. The interim constitution, finalized in 2007, guarantees some religious freedom but prohibits people from trying to convert others. On February 10, 2007, Benedict XVI elevated the prefecture of Nepal {{to the rank of}} a vicariate and appointed Anthony Francis Sharma as the first vicar and first Nepalese bishop of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Silence is a 2016 {{historical}} period drama film {{directed by}} Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, {{based on the}} 1966 novel {{of the same name}} by Shūsaku Endō. Set in Nagasaki, Japan, the film was shot entirely in Taiwan around Taipei. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciarán Hinds. The plot follows two 17th-century Jesuit priests who travel from Portugal to Edo-era Japan to locate their missing mentor and spread Catholic Christianity. The story is set in the time when it was common <b>for</b> <b>Christians</b> to hide from persecution following the suppression of Japanese Roman Catholics during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638) against the Tokugawa shogunate.|$|E
5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant <b>for</b> <b>Christians.</b> The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary <b>for</b> <b>Christians</b> to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a very {{influential}} early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's Supper fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed {{that in the}} Supper Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which he saw as an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that the Supper confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God and love for other people. He believed it necessary <b>for</b> <b>Christians</b> to partake of Christ's humanity in the Supper {{as well as his}} Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's Supper as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's Supper was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's Supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of the Supper to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism.|$|E
