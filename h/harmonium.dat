5|$|Bhardwaj {{started playing}} <b>harmonium</b> for {{friends who were}} ghazal singers. After a few years, he took up {{a job with a}} music company called CBS in Delhi. He later came to Mumbai to become a music {{composer}} and he only took to directing films to create the opportunity to compose music.|$|E
5|$|The <b>harmonium</b> {{was out of}} {{tune with}} {{everything}}. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the <b>harmonium</b> track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} {{was not part}} of Rossini's original version for two pianos and <b>harmonium,</b> but he inserted it in his version for orchestra. He transposed an earlier composition. It became customary to include it even in performances and editions with piano(s).|$|E
5000|$|The last mass-producer of <b>harmoniums</b> in North America was the Estey company, which ceased {{manufacture}} in the mid-1950s; {{a couple}} of Italian companies continued into the 1970s. As the existing stock of instruments aged and spare parts became hard to find, more and more were either scrapped or sold. It was not uncommon for <b>harmoniums</b> to be [...] "modernised" [...] by having electric blowers fitted, often very unsympathetically. The majority of Western <b>harmoniums</b> today {{are in the hands}} of enthusiasts, though the instrument remains popular in South Asia.|$|R

5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the <b>harmonium</b> to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|Rijram Desad, a multi-instrumentalist whose past work {{included}} film {{scores and}} ballets with vocalists such as Lata Mangeshkar, played Indian <b>harmonium</b> and tabla tarang. Shivkumar Sharma contributed on santoor, and the bansuri (bamboo flute) was played by S.R. Kenkare. Hariprasad Chaurasia also contributed on bansuri, {{but only after}} the soundtrack pieces had been completed, and the efficient progress of the sessions allowed Harrison to record some other compositions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteen}} {{tracks on}} Wonderwall Music range from {{just over a}} minute in length to five-and-a-half minutes. On some pressings of the 1968 LP, various pieces lacked mastering rills between them; with these selections instead presented as medleys, the number of distinct album tracks was reduced to twelve. On many of the Indian selections, instruments such as sitar, surbahar and <b>harmonium</b> provide a drone-like backing, over which Harrison's chosen instrument plays the main musical theme.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Late Jogesh Chandra Biswas first {{modified}} the then-existing <b>Harmoniums,</b> so it folds {{down into a}} much thinner space for easier-maneuverability. Prior to that, if the instrument is boxed, used to need 2 person to carry it, holding it from either sides. This improvisation became a generic design in most <b>harmoniums</b> since then and coined with the term [...] "Folding Harmoniums".|$|R

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a <b>harmonium,</b> and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|The Marble Index is {{the second}} solo album and third studio album by German {{musician}} Nico, which was released in November 1968 on Elektra Records. The avant-garde sound introduced in the album—a stark contrast with her folk pop debut, Chelsea Girl—was {{the result of the}} combination of Nico's droning <b>harmonium</b> and somber vocals, and producer John Cale's musical arrangements, which were inspired by modern European classical music. Nico envisioned the release as an attempt to get artistic legitimacy, thus also drastically changing the looks that had initially made her famous as a fashion model.|$|E
5|$|The {{contributing}} musicians included Indian sarodya Aashish Khan and tablist Mahapurush Misra, {{the last}} of whom was the regular accompanist to Khan's father, Ali Akbar Khan. Aashish Khan and Misra's contributions were recorded at Abbey Road, rather than later in India, since the pair were performing in London in December 1967. Barham attended this session and also contributed {{to some of the}} Western recordings for Wonderwall, playing piano, <b>harmonium</b> and flugelhorn, and providing orchestral arrangements for flutes, oboes and trumpet. Another session with some unnamed Indian musicians took place on 5 January 1968.|$|E

5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played <b>harmonium,</b> Fontenot says this contribution is inaudible on the completed track. A mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|The song {{features}} the lead pair singing amidst a flower farm as mridangam and flute players accompany {{them in the}} background. It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram who also appears in a cameo, playing a <b>harmonium.</b> As part of their roles, the male supporting actors who appear in the song were required to wear a panjakkacham and angavastram, leaving most of their body exposed to the freezing cold. The shoot began as early as 5:30 AM and the locals, who thought they should be out of their mind to be dressed so, came {{up to them and}} warned that they might freeze to death.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and <b>harmonium.</b> Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
50|$|Other {{instruments}} {{that might be}} in a Boeremusiek band would be piano accordions, button harmonicas, accordions, pianos, <b>harmoniums</b> and the guitar, and sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by George Hele (1836-1919). Initially George {{concentrated}} on selling organs, pianos and <b>harmoniums,</b> but in 1865 he started work in Truro building his first instrument, an organ for Devoran Wesleyan Methodist Chapel.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prominent}} {{use of the}} banjo, Zapoppin’ have always used lesser-known and home-made instruments including <b>harmoniums,</b> cajóns, lagerphones, The Z-Kit (a homemade stomp-box, snare drum, cymbal and bell) and a vintage Hohner Symphonic 32 electric organ.|$|R
5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a piano version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced to only one piano, also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for <b>harmonium</b> and only one piano. Ricordi published a piano reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brittan had varied {{interests}} and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch, joined others in various activities. He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch, and later helped improve the grounds and {{raised money for}} fencing the area. He was into horse racing, later bred horses, and Canterbury's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm. The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England. Joseph Brittan had a portable <b>harmonium</b> and as in the early years, Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch, he joined a musical group in the port town. For performances, he walked over the Bridle Path with the instrument strapped to his back. Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Garikapati Varalakshmi {{were chosen}} {{as one of}} the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play <b>harmonium</b> and gave him a few music lessons so he would look {{believable}} in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend.|$|E

40|$|With {{this article}} the Diocesan Archives in Barcelona wishes to {{participate}} {{on the occasion}} of the much deserved tribute paid to Canon Dr. Josep Pavia. We present a synopsis of the almost disastrous state of some 54 organs and 173 <b>harmoniums,</b> some of which were of great artistic and musical worth. We can but ask ourselves - why this state of affairs? We cannot fathom the reasons behind such disrepair. Surely the musical instruments are not to blame? May the present study contribute to a greater understanding of the history of our <b>harmoniums</b> and church organs. [ca] Amb motiu del merescut homenatge que se li ofereix al canonge Dr. Josep Pavia, l'Arxiu Diocesà de Barcelona, vol col•laborar amb el present article. Aquest resum tracta de la quasi absoluta desfeta d'orgues —en nombre de cinquanta-quatre— i d'harmòniums —en nombre de cent setanta-tres—, alguns d'ells eren peces de gran interés artístico-musical. Hom sols es pregunta: "Perqué?" [...] . No entenem els motius de tan gran destrucció. Quina culpa tenien aquests instruments musicals? L'article pot servir ais investigadors de referent a la història dels nostres <b>harmòniums</b> i orgues...|$|R

5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the <b>harmonium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns's student {{compositions}} {{included a}} symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber {{believed that the}} prize {{should have gone to}} Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for <b>harmonium</b> (1852).|$|E
5|$|The {{mass was}} first {{performed}} on 14 March 1864 at the couple's new residence in Paris, the hôtel of Louise, comtesse de Pillet-Will. The countess is the dedicatee of this refined and elegant piece, which avoids the sentimental opulence of most contemporary liturgical works, {{such as those}} by Charles Gounod. Albert Lavignac, aged eighteen, conducted from the <b>harmonium.</b> The soloists were the sisters Carlotta and Barbara Marchisio, Italo Gardoni and Luigi Agnesi. The sisters Marchisio had performed together in Rossini's works before, such as the leading parts of the lovers in his opera Semiramide. Rossini, who had helped prepare for the performance, turned pages for the first pianist, Georges Mathias, and marked tempos by nodding his head. Among the first listeners were Giacomo Meyerbeer, Daniel Auber and Ambroise Thomas. The performance was repeated the following day, for a larger audience which included members of the press.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, {{all three}} of <b>Harmoniums</b> studio albums were named among the 100 {{greatest}} Canadian albums of all time in Bob Mersereaus book The Top 100 Canadian Albums. They were the only francophone albums from Quebec named to the list besides Jean-Pierre Ferlands Jaune.|$|R
5000|$|The Kurt Vonnegut novel The Sirens of Titan (1959) {{is in part}} set {{in caves}} on a tidally locked Mercury, home to {{peculiar}} animals known as <b>harmoniums</b> that cling to {{the walls of the}} caves and derive their energy from vibrations in the rock.|$|R
50|$|At {{the peak}} of the instruments' Western {{popularity}} around 1900, a wide variety of styles of <b>harmoniums</b> were being produced. These ranged from simple models with plain cases and only four or five stops (if any at all), up to large instruments with ornate cases, up to a dozen stops and other mechanisms such as couplers. Expensive <b>harmoniums</b> were often built to resemble pipe organs, with ranks of fake pipes attached {{to the top of the}} instrument. Small numbers of <b>harmoniums</b> were built with two manuals (keyboards). Some were even built with pedal keyboards, which required the use of an assistant to run the bellows or, for some of the later models, an electrical pump. These larger instruments were mainly intended for home use, such as allowing organists to practise on an instrument on the scale of a pipe organ, but without the physical size or volume of such an instrument. For missionaries, chaplains in the armed forces, travelling evangelists, and the like, reed organs that folded up into a container the size of a very large suitcase or small trunk were made; these had a short keyboard and few stops, but they were more than adequate for keeping hymn singers more or less on pitch.|$|R
