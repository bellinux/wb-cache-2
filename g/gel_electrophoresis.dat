5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> of RT-PCR products.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{isozymes}} may {{be almost}} identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions {{that change the}} electric charge of the enzyme (such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid) are simple to identify by <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> and this forms {{the basis for the}} use of isozymes as molecular markers. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch, but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or {{sieving medium}} during electrophoresis, the {{movement}} of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA <b>Gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but {{may be used as}} a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.|$|E

25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> {{is used to}} {{separate}} native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis).</b> Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
