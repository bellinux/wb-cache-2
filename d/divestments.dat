40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the role played by {{leadership}} in <b>divestment</b> decision making and indeed during the corporate restructuring phase for retail organisations. In doing so, the paper aims to contribute to a growing body of research that seeks to develop understanding of the factors leading to retail <b>divestment</b> and the nature of corporate response to <b>divestment.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A multiple case approach is utilised. The cases are selected from a database of international retail <b>divestment</b> activity over a longitudinal period. Findings – The paper demonstrates that <b>divestment</b> can be a response to “failure”, however, support is also provided for the assertion that <b>divestment</b> can be a strategic decision to devote resources more efficiently elsewhere, either at home or abroad. A key finding is the role of leadership and managerial stability in relation to <b>divestment</b> and restructuring at home and abroad. Research limitations/implications – The themes presented in this paper are developed from observational data. The validity of the themes should be examined further through in-depth, qualitative case studies of <b>divestment</b> activity. Future research could examine the role of new CEOs both in relation to the <b>divestment</b> itself and during the process of restructuring following <b>divestment.</b> Practical implications – The role of leadership and managerial stability in <b>divestment</b> and corporate restructuring processes are highlighted.

40|$|The {{propensity}} of corporate executives and strategists to restructure their companies has intensified in recent years. Although a substantial literature, mainly overseas, has addressed the motives and economic consequences of mergers and acquisitions, comparatively {{little research has}} been directed towards corporate <b>divestment</b> activity, particularly in the Australasian region. This research investigates the motives for <b>divestment,</b> and some major factors influencing <b>divestment</b> decision-making of New Zealand listed companies. It highlights the importance of <b>divestment</b> as an integral aspect of corporate restructuring processes. An inter-disciplinary model of <b>divestment</b> has been developed and explored in this study. Three different but inter-related perspectives - industrial organisation economics; corporate strategy; and finance - capture the various dimensions of <b>divestment</b> activity hitherto unexplored in a single study. This study relied on mail survey questionnaire as a data collection method. The senior executives of leading companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange were asked to indicate the relative importance of the <b>divestment</b> motives and factors affecting their companies I <b>divestment</b> activities for the past five financial years. Non-parametric statistical methods were employed to test the research hypotheses. The research results offer strong support for the conceptual model of <b>divestment.</b> This confirms the notion that selected environmental, organisational, and performance factors have significant influences on a firm I s motives for <b>divestment,</b> which in turn determines the corresponding <b>divestment</b> strategy formulation and implementation adopted by firms...|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the boycott is {{targeted}} <b>divestment,</b> or disinvestment. Targeted <b>divestment</b> involves campaigning for withdrawal of investment, for example the Sudan <b>Divestment</b> campaign involves putting pressure on companies, often through shareholder activism, to withdraw investment that helps the Sudanese government perpetuate genocide in Darfur. Only if a company refuses to change its behavior in response to shareholder engagement does the targeted <b>divestment</b> model call for <b>divestment</b> from that company. Such targeted <b>divestment</b> implicitly excludes companies involved in agriculture, the production and distribution of consumer goods, or the provision {{of goods and services}} intended to relieve human suffering or to promote health, religious and spiritual activities, or education.|$|R

Brands, Inc. PepsiCo also previously owned several other brands that it later sold so it could focus on its primary snack food and beverage lines, according to investment analysts reporting on the <b>divestments</b> in 1997.

25|$|In 1967, Ford {{partnered with}} the South Korean company Hyundai, {{and at the}} new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai {{introduced}} their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988–1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994–1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. After subsequent <b>divestments,</b> Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.|$|E

The NDL and the HAPAG therefore entered into a cooperation agreement in 1930, and beginning in 1935, instituted joint operations in the North Atlantic. The first signs of a merger were visible. By 1932, the NDL was in an {{economic crisis}}, with about 5,000 employees let go, salary cuts, and red ink. Glässel was dismissed. The government placed both NDL and HAPAG in trusteeship under Siegfried Graf von Roedern, and following the death of Stimming, Heinrich F. Albert briefly became head of the NDL, followed after some eighteen months by the National Socialist Rudolph Firle. Bremen State Councillor Karl Lindemann was Chairman of the Board from 1933 to 1945. A programme of economic recovery by <b>divestments</b> and restructuring was initiated. HBAL and the Roland Line became independent companies once more, and other lines took over services to Africa and the Mediterranean. The Nazi regime ordered both NDL and HAPAG to relinquish ships to other lines which were to operate in their regions without competition from other German companies, in particular to Hamburg Süd, the Deutsche Afrika-Linien and the Deutsche Levante Linie.|$|E

40|$|The {{fossil fuel}} <b>divestment</b> {{movement}} has undergone explosive {{growth over the}} last few years - expanding from encouraging educational institutions to adopt ethical investment policies to focusing upon cities, pension funds and philanthropic charities. The fossil fuel <b>divestment</b> movement has attained global ambitions - challenging sovereign wealth funds and national governments to engage in fossil fuel <b>divestment,</b> and pushing for fossil fuel <b>divestment</b> at international climate talks - such as the Paris Climate Summit in 2015. By exploring and analysing a key campaign to 'Divest Norway', this chapter considers the efforts to globalise and internationalise the fossil fuel <b>divestment</b> campaign. Part 1 explores the origins of the fossil fuel <b>divestment</b> movement, and the application of such strategies in a variety of contexts. Part 2 looks at the campaign to divest Norway's sovereign wealth fund of fossil fuel investments.

International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management. 33 (1), pp. 5 - 22 RAE 2008 Purpose ? The {{research}} {{presented here}} initiates {{the process of}} the detailed analysis of international retail <b>divestment</b> activity through the identification of the volume of global <b>divestment</b> activity and the characteristics of that activity during the timeframe of 1987 - 2003. Design/methodology/approach ? The methodology followed here is essentially historical in nature and draws {{on a wide range of}} contemporary periodicals, reports and other sources. Findings ? The paper reports findings on: the form and extent of <b>divestment</b> activity; the year of divestment; <b>divestment</b> by retail sub-sector; divested chain size; length of time spent in the market of divestment; <b>divestment</b> by retail sub-sector; and the market of origin of divesting retailer. Originality/value ? This paper provides an initial indication of the volume and nature of international retail <b>divestment</b> in the period considered. Such material has not been available previously. International retailing research has primarily focused on the internationalisation process rather than retail <b>divestment</b> from international markets. However, <b>divestment</b> from international markets is an issue of increasing importance within the competitive global environment. Previously research into retail <b>divestment</b> has focused on individual company experience. For the first time, the research presented here attempts to build a picture of the scale and dimensions of international retail withdrawal.

40|$|In a {{relatively}} short time, the fossil-fuel <b>divestment</b> movement has emerged with global momentum, {{in light of the}} industry’s influence on carbon induced anthropogenic climate change. <b>Divestment</b> is pursued by investors as a means to either mitigate against the risks of a tightening carbon budget and of stranding assets or as a means of activism to force change on the fossil fuel industry. Literature on the topic to date suggests that <b>divestment</b> may have a direct impact on share prices or indirect impact stigmatizing the fossil fuel industry. Conversely, skeptics argue that <b>divestment</b> may be too small to have a measurable impact. However, there is no empirical study that distinctly measures the impact of <b>divestment</b> and related events on the fossil fuel industry. The objective of this thesis is to objectively measure the impact of <b>divestment</b> events and compare its efficacy relative to similar events. Thus, the purpose of this thesis is two-fold, asking whether <b>divestment</b> events impact the fossil fuel industry and whether <b>divestment</b> events are more impactful than events on the carbon budget and stranded assets. In line with existing literature from the anti-Apartheid <b>divestment</b> movement, this study adopts the event study methodology to measure the impact. The findings indicate that announcements of fossil-fuel <b>divestment,</b> stranded assets, and the carbon budget do negatively impact the share price of fossil fuel firms equally, on and around the event date. These results infer that the financial market perceives <b>divestment</b> and related events to be a material threat to the performance of fossil fuel firms. This thesis contributes to existing literature on fossil-fuel <b>divestment</b> by strengthening the ethical case that <b>divestment</b> can not only ‘do well’ as a financial tool but ‘do good’ as an activism tool as well...|$|R
