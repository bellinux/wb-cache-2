40|$|This paper {{presents}} an in-depth study of prominent health and fitness-themed smartphone apps. Results {{of the study}} first <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> placed on self-improvement with apps such as MyFitnessPal, as activities including exercise tracking are deemed means for achieving health and fitness goals. At the same time, and {{in the style of}} “mobile privatization,” apps connect individual users to the “outside world” as well, mainly by facilitating network ties between (and further surveillance of) like-minded consumers. This activity is said to be possible “on the go,” as apps capitalize on the portable nature of smartphone hardware. Acknowledging that these ways of “conducting conduct” might engender productive and rewarding outcomes, the paper concludes with critical reflections on the app model of service provision and its alliance with a neoliberal approach to health and fitness promotion...|$|E

Notably, with {{the extension of}} patentability to pharmaceuticals, the sector is now at a dynamic stage of transformation, translated by a notable development of the industry of generics. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the mutations that have marked the Tunisian {{pharmaceutical industry}} over the last decade and study its potential of developing future innovation. In this purpose, the paper is divided into two main parts.

In the second part, the paper aims at studying the perspectives for innovation in Tunisia through the study of the innovation capabilities in the Tunisian pharmaceutical sector.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a process of}} developing evidence-based design guidelines {{to be used in}} environments where people with dementia and sight loss are living. The research involved a systematically conducted literature review and a series of consultations with people affected by dementia and/or sight loss who lived or worked in care homes or in domestic settings. Findings from the literature and the consultations were used in an iterative process to develop the guidelines. The process is outlined, providing examples from the guidelines about lighting and colour and contrast. In discussing the research findings and the development process, the authors consider implications of the work including the weakness of the evidence base, the challenges of improving this and the need for innovative approaches to understanding the complexities of design for people with dementia and sight loss. They <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> in the literature on independence for people with sight loss and the focus on control of people with dementia, arguing that this falls short of a genuinely person-centred approach, which recognises the active participation of people with dementia and sight loss...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how teachers in Swedish schools abroad reason about their work developing the Swedish language as the students live in a non-Swedish speaking country although going to a Swedish school. Furthermore the study intends to examine the teachers' attitudes towards the impact the Swedish language has upon the school. Research questions: What thoughts do the teachers signify in reference to the language development of the students? How do the teachers reason about the role of the Swedish language in the school? In order to answer these questions, qualitative measures has been used in terms of observations and interviews. The study is based upon a social constructivist perspective with the idea that reality is socially constructed. I am inspired by Vygotskijs theories regarding children's language development which presents a socio-cultural perspective.   The result shows that the Swedish language has a great influence in school and that the teachers' attitudes towards the Swedish language is of major importance in order to encourage the students' language development.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the teaching of}} English literature within extramural organisations for adults in England between 1885 and 1910. This challenges {{the assumption that the}} beginnings of English as a tertiary-level academic subject can be traced back only as far as the foundation of the Oxford English School {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century; in fact extramural English courses had been flourishing for decades before this, and these reached their zenith in the final years before it was introduced at Oxbridge. Oxford created an Honours School of English in 1894, and the Cambridge English Tripos was established in 1917; in ideological terms, such developments were of course crucial, yet it has too often been the case that the extramural literary teaching being conducted contemporaneously has been sidelined in studies of the period. My first chapter will consider the development of English in various institutional and non-institutional environments before 1885, including Edinburgh University, Dissenting Academies, and Mechanics’ Institutes. Thereafter I will explore the campaign, led by University Extension lecturer John Churton Collins, to incorporate English literature as an honours degree at Oxford. Focusing on the period between 1885 and 1891, this second chapter will assess the veracity of some of Collins’s most vehement claims regarding the apparently low critical and pedagogical standards in existence at the time, which he felt could only be improved if Oxford would agree to institutionalise the subject, and thereby raise the standard of teaching more generally. Collins’s campaign enjoyed more success when he drew attention to the scholarly teaching available within the University Extension Movement; my third chapter is underpinned by research and analysis of previously unexplored material at the archives of London University, such as syllabuses, examination papers, and lecturers’ reports. I examine the way in which English literature, the most popular subject among Extension students, was actually being taught outside the universities while still excluded from Oxbridge. Thereafter my penultimate chapter focuses on an extramural reading group formed by Cambridge Extension lecturer Richard G. Moulton. This section considers Moulton’s formulation of an innovative mode of literary interpretation, tailored specifically to suit the abilities of extramural students, and which also lent itself particularly to the study of novels. Uncollected T. P. ’s Weekly articles written by Arnold Bennett <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> that he placed on pleasure, rather than scholarship. My final chapter considers Bennett’s self-imposed demarcation from the more serious extramural pedagogues of literature, such as Collins and Moulton, and his extraordinary impact on Edwardian reading habits. A brief coda will compare the findings of the 1921 “Newbolt Report” with my own assessment of fin-de-siècle extramural education...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} extent of inclusivity in post-apartheid income growth by focusing on one intuitive part of the income distribution: the actual middle (or middle-income strata). If South African macro and social policy explicitly aims to be ‘inclusive’, {{it is important to}} know how the average [median] South African income level changed over the first fifteen years of democracy. Common summary measures of economic progress such as GDP per capita may mask the standard of living experienced by the majority of the population in any particular period. Tracking the progress in the middle strata of South Africa’s income distribution provides a fresh perspective on the nature of economic progress in the country. This is against a worrying backdrop of rising income inequality post- 1994 (Van der Berg and Louw, 2004; Hoogeveen and Özler, 2006; Leibbrandt et al, 2010). The paper is structured as follows.
