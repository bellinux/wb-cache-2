5000|$|Electric current {{assisted}} sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents {{to densify}} powders, with {{the advantage of}} reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks {{to the possibility of}} direct sintering, without the need of pre-pressing and a <b>green</b> <b>compact.</b> Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is hot pressing, which has been under use for the production of the diamond tools employed in the construction industry. Spark plasma sintering and electro sinter forging are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.|$|E
40|$|Imperial Users onlyThis Thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the compaction and the sintering of ceramic powders within the context of their "near net shape forming" into dense bodies. The operation of near net shape forming is the manufacture of ceramic parts with a required external dimensional tolerance combined with a defect free internal microstructure. The current study considers these requirements by focusing upon the fundamental facets of near net shape forming operations. The effects of the processing and material parameters on the compaction behaviour of agglomerated alumina powders have been investigated experimentally. It has been shown that the <b>green</b> <b>compacts,</b> formed from the agglomerated alumina powders by the uniaxial die pressing technique, possess certain density distribution patterns due to the frictional forces during the compaction process, and these density distributions depend primarily upon the properties of the agglomerates and the lubrication state of the die wall. The density distributions in the <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> have been determined experimentally using the coloured layer technique and predicted using a first order model. Due to the inhomogeneous density distributions in the <b>green</b> <b>compacts,</b> the shrinkage of the compacts was not homogeneous. As a result, the shapes of the sintered compacts were not geometrically linear scaled replicas of the <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> and the shape distortions in the sintered compacts have been characterised. It has been shown that there is a relationship between the extent of the shape distortions and the density distributions in the green compacts; that is, the more inhomogeneous <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> the more is the shape distortions in the resulting sintered compacts. Sintering and grain growth equations, modified from established relationships, have been used for the sintering simulations in order to predict both the progression of the density and grain size of the sintered compacts. In order to predict the overall shape of the sintered compacts, a first order model has been developed by combining the predicted density distributions in the <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> and the predicted density of the sintered compacts. The extent of the shape distortions have been reduced by optimising the properties of the agglomerates and the state of the die wall lubrication condition...|$|R
40|$|Yttria-doped zirconia/ruthenia powders {{were made}} by co-precipitation. The {{calcined}} powders were <b>compacted</b> into <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> using standard pressing techniques such as isostatical compaction compared to explosive compaction. Explosive compaction (EC) led to the highest density, but also to cracking of the compacts. The zirconia/ruthenia powders compacted by isostatical pressing could not be densified by pressureless sintering (58 %), but sinterforging these <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> led to dense compacts (96 %), which showed large-scale phase separation between the yttria-doped zirconia and ruthenia phase. The explosively densified <b>green</b> <b>compacts</b> could be further densified to 92 % by pressureless sintering, without the occurrence of the large-scale phase separation that took place within the isostatically pressed (IP) and sinterforged (SF) samples. The microstructure of the explosively densified composites was more fine-grained and homogeneous. Thus, by tuning the green density of yttria-doped zirconia/ruthenia compacts the phase separation after sintering can be tuned. This phase separation largely determines the electrical properties of these materials, which means that these electrical properties will be tunable as well...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a <b>green</b> <b>compact</b> at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, golf club heads and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% dense Ti Grade 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V master alloy. The mechanical properties compare well with those exhibited by cast-and-wrought products. A cost estimate of less than $3.00 for a 0.320 g automotive connection link has been made.|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{and quality}} {{assurance}} have become major considerations {{in the design}} and manufacture of today’s parts and products. Survivability of <b>green</b> <b>compact</b> using powder metallurgy technology is considered as one of the major quality attributes in manufacturing systems today. During powder metallurgy (PM) production, the compaction conditions and behavior of the metal powder dictate the stress and density distribution in the <b>green</b> <b>compact</b> prior to sintering. These parameters greatly influence the mechanical properties and overall strength of the final component. In order to improve these properties, higher compaction pressures are usually employed, which make unloading and ejection of green compacts more challenging, especially for the powder-compacted parts with relatively complicated shapes.
