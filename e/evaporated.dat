5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet <b>evaporated</b> liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was <b>evaporated</b> to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{thermohydrodynamics}} of an <b>evaporating</b> droplet is {{investigated by}} using a single-component pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model.

In order to gain an exhaustive understanding of the complex hydrodynamics during evaporation, a single droplet is selected as a case study. At first, some tests for a stationary (non-) <b>evaporating</b> droplet are carried out to validate the method. Then the model is used to study the thermohydrodynamics of a falling <b>evaporating</b> droplet. The results show that the model is capable of reproducing the flow dynamics and transport phenomena of a stationary <b>evaporating</b> droplet quite well. Of course, a moving droplet <b>evaporates</b> faster than a stationary one due to the convective transport.

By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely <b>evaporated.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} thin film {{evolution}} equation for a wetting <b>evaporating</b> liquid on a smooth solid substrate. The model is valid for slowly <b>evaporating</b> small sessile droplets when thermal effects are insignificant, while wettability and capillarity play a major role. The model is first employed to study steady <b>evaporating</b> drops that are fed locally through the substrate. An asymptotic analysis focuses on the precursor film and the transition region towards the bulk drop and a numerical continuation of steady drops determines their fully non-linear profiles. Following this, we study the time evolution of freely <b>evaporating</b> drops without influx for several initial drop shapes. As a result we find that drops initially spread if their initial contact angle {{is larger than the}} apparent contact angle of large steady <b>evaporating</b> drops with influx.

5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or <b>evaporated.</b> Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers.
