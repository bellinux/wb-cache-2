One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E

Amyntas's heart gave a mighty beat against his chest. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were the very lights of love, carrying passionate kisses on their beams.
