40|$|This study {{explores the}} complex and {{relatively}} under-researched topic of out of session frame <b>deviations.</b> It considers the role of frame <b>deviations</b> in psychodynamic psychotherapy and the various conceptualisations of the frame, examining the debate between the ideas of a flexible and ‘elastic’ frame and a more unchanging and ‘impenetrable’ frame. The study uses a qualitative design to examine therapists’ understandings of out of session frame <b>deviations</b> as they have experienced them in practice. Six psychodynamic psychotherapists were interviewed and asked for their perceptions regarding out of session frame <b>deviations.</b> What emerged from {{the analysis of the}} interview material were diverse experiences of the types of frame <b>deviations</b> outside of the consulting room, by both therapist and patient. In addition, therapists felt that out of session frame <b>deviations</b> might {{have an impact on the}} therapeutic process, depending on their unconscious roots and on particular factors that were unique to the relationship. Therapists had strong countertransference reactions to out of session frame <b>deviations</b> and their handling of the <b>deviations</b> was often informed by these reactions. The handling of out of session frame <b>deviations</b> was also seen as specific to the relationship and, therefore, unique in each instance. Therapists’ perceptions of patient dynamics as they related to out of session frame <b>deviations</b> illustrated the varied functions that the <b>deviations</b> may serve and demonstrated that transference was sometimes prominent in the <b>deviations.</b> Therapists also emphasised the flexibility of the psychotherapy frame itself. The study illustrated that out of session frame <b>deviations</b> are important and relate significantly to the process of psychodynamic psychotherapy.
