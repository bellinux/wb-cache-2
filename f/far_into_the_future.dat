5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up <b>far</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so <b>far</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E

In some respects Prokofiev was a surprising choice; he was at this stage better known abroad than in the Soviet Union, and had acquired a reputation for dissonance. Moreover, his ballet Le pas d'acier had fared badly at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre in 1929. The composer's first response was to refuse the commission; {{a member of the}} production team recalled that Prokofiev [...] "categorically rejected my proposal.

Based on these facts, we hypothesize that existing compensation policy induces executives to reduce investments during their last years in office.

The public, and/or conservation organizations would have to specify the terms of the “demand curve ” reflecting the public values attached to preventing forest conversion. Results are consistent with existing economic theory and empirical evidence of forest landowner program participation: landowners prefer larger per acre annual incentive payments, they prefer to commit to shorter contract duration, and they require extra compensation to engage in ecosystem production-enhancing forest management. The value of development option (however <b>far</b> removed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>future)</b> is confirmed: landowners strongly dislike permanent conservation easement programs. Landowners concerned about the development pressure on their forestland appear more willing to participate in forest preservation programs.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed {{for the assessment of}} low altitude trapped proton fluxes for future space missions. Low altitude fluxes are dependent on solar activity levels due to the resulting heating and cooling of the upper atmosphere. However, solar activity levels cannot be accurately predicted <b>far</b> enough <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> to accommodate typical spacecraft mission planning. Thus, the approach suggested here is to evaluate the trapped proton flux as a function of confidence level for a given mission time period. This is possible because of a recent advance in trapped proton modeling that uses the solar 10. 7 cm radio flux, a measure of solar cycle activity, to calculate trapped proton fluxes as a continuous function of time throughout the solar cycle. This trapped proton model is combined with a new statistical description of the 10. 7 cm flux to obtain the probabilistic model for low altitude trapped proton fluxes. Results for proton energies ranging from 1. 5 to 81. 3 MeV are examined as a function of time throughout solar cycle 22 for various orbits. For altitudes below 1000 km, fluxes are significantly higher and energy spectra are significantly harder than those predicted by the AP 8 model...|$|R

We further compare traffic models built using these distributions in a simulated environment; comparing performance predictions (over a number of metrics) obtained from these models to the actual results from our real-world traffic traces...|$|R
