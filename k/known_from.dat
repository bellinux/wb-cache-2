5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly <b>known</b> <b>from</b> branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are <b>known</b> <b>from</b> a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are <b>known</b> <b>from</b> Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> the formation, and is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of Indraloris {{have been}} found only in the Miocene Siwalik fossil beds of India and Pakistan. I.himalayensis is known only from Haritalyangar, a Late Miocene site in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. This site has been dated to about 9 million years ago. This site has also yielded Sivaladapis nagrii. Indraloris kamlialensis is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> two sites in the {{province}} of Punjab, Pakistan, that are both dated to 15.2 million years ago: Y642 and Y682. Sivaladapis palaendicus has also been recorded at both sites, and two lorisids are <b>known</b> <b>from</b> Y682. The unnamed large Indraloris is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> Y642 and an older site, Y801 (16.8 million years old). All are in the Potwar Plateau region.|$|E

Multifurca is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.|$|E

5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. The fungus is {{widespread}} in Europe, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Scandinavia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America. In Asia, the fungus {{has been reported}} in Korea, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan. It is also <b>known</b> <b>from</b> Greenland. A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be circumboreal.|$|E
5|$|Macaws {{are known}} to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from {{mainland}} South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, endemic species, since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there. As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are <b>known</b> <b>from</b> physical remains; the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> nineteen museum skins and subfossils, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones) is only <b>known</b> <b>from</b> subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is <b>known</b> <b>from</b> subfossils and reports. No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times.|$|E

Other possible remains have been assigned to Zhuchengosaurus, a probable junior synonym of Shantungosaurus, and material tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
