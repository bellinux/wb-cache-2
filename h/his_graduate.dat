5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not see}} space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Brode {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett. He was impressed by Blackett's cloud chambers, and set <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> students to work on projects using them, starting with Dale R. Corson.|$|E
5|$|Byrd {{also played}} for Maryland-based semi-professional {{baseball}} teams while pursuing <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> studies. In 1910, the Chicago White Sox signed Byrd, {{but he was}} soon traded to the San Francisco Seals, a semi-professional Pacific Coast League baseball team with whom he pitched in 1912. He returned to Maryland later that year, and in 1913, married Katherine Dunlop Turnbull. Before they divorced twenty years later, the couple had three sons and a daughter: Harry, Sterling, William, and Evelyn.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. <b>His</b> <b>graduate</b> student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> {{writings}} of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Reines took {{most of his}} {{neutrino}} {{research team}} {{with him when he}} left for the new University of California, Irvine (UCI), becoming its first dean of physical sciences. At UCI, Reines extended the research interests of some of <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> students into the development of medical radiation detectors, such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy.|$|E

5|$|The animators also {{employed}} subsurface scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> student {{days at the}} University of Utah in the 1970s—to render {{surfaces in}} a more lifelike way. This {{would be the first}} time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first child}} Peter {{was born in}} May 1941, and their second child, Katherine ("Toni"), was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7, 1944. During his marriage, Oppenheimer {{continued}} his affair with Jean Tatlock. Later their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's Communist associations. Many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s. They included his brother Frank, Frank's wife Jackie, Kitty, Jean Tatlock, his landlady Mary Ellen Washburn, and several of <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> students at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> {{studies at}} Harvard, Sledd briefly {{served as a}} Latin instructor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was ordained as a Methodist minister and licensed to preach in 1898. At the suggestion of his father, he contacted Methodist minister Warren Akin Candler, then president of Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, who was a prominent leader of the Georgia Methodist Conference and was a few months from being elevated as a Methodist bishop. Candler {{was impressed with the}} character and academic credentials of the young scholar, and assisted him in becoming a professor of Latin language and literature at Emory College, a position Sledd held from 1898 to 1902. While living in the Candler family home, Sledd {{fell in love with the}} bishop's only daughter, Annie Florence Candler, and he married her on March 22, 1899; his father conducted the wedding ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman did <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, {{which then}} {{patterned}} its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication.|$|E
5|$|He {{enrolled}} {{in graduate school}} in electrical engineering at University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1953, and a Ph.D. in 1955. As {{a graduate student at}} Berkeley he assisted {{in the construction of the}} California Digital Computer project CALDIC. <b>His</b> <b>graduate</b> work led to eight patents. After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, Inc., to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Du Bois {{received}} a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen {{to attend the}} University of Berlin for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital, while studying with some of that nation's most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke. After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> studies; in 1895 {{he was the first}} African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. His dissertation was The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638–1871.|$|E
5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel {{when he was a}} graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 {{detonation}} of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted {{an all-out}} {{effort by the}} United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler's department head at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to re-establish careers interrupted by the war and were reluctant to face more disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield, {{but there was also}} now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler agreed to go to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of <b>his</b> <b>graduate</b> students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.|$|E
