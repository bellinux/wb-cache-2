5|$|He {{then turned}} down a tax-free $500,000 {{contract}} {{to stay in the}} KHL. Instead, Shirokov defected to North America and signed with the Canucks to a two-year, two-way US$1.75 million contract on 17 August 2009. The deal allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an annual US$875,000 at the NHL level or C$67,500 in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Dickinson {{underwent}} {{seven weeks}} of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour {{found at the}} back of his tongue. Dickinson's medical team expected <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a full recovery as the tumour was discovered in the early stages. On 15 May, Dickinson was given the all-clear by his specialists.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher's extra pace as {{a result}} of his lighter fuel loads meant he was able to pull out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, {{allowing}} Nicola Larini to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{is still}} {{struggling}} with his marriage to Angie, who had thrown him out of their family home. Later in this episode, the pair reconcile, but only if Tracy allows for Angie to follow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that he isn't having an affair.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E
50|$|He wrote ‘Follow the Footsteps of the Buddha in India and Nepal,’ a {{book that}} bought the {{inspiration}} for the VTC1 Television <b>to</b> accompany <b>him</b> <b>to</b> India <b>to</b> <b>make</b> documentary film about Buddhist pilgrimage in India and Nepal.|$|R

5|$|Cagney {{spent most}} of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis {{named in honor of}} his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Hunt's {{coaching}} staff have speculated <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an experimental shift into the midfield (as centreman or ruck rover), however he was again selected at fullback for the match against the Box Hill Hawks. In the match Hunt had just three kicks, three handpasses and two marks before straining his groin {{in the final}} minutes and missed following games through injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} for Apollo 8, {{one of the}} responsibilities Kraft faced was ensuring that a fleet would be waiting to recover the crew when they splashed {{down at the end}} of the mission. This proved an unusual challenge, because much of the Pacific fleet of the US Navy would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period. Kraft had to personally meet with Admiral John McCain in order to persuade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the requisite resources available to NASA.|$|E
5|$|J. Mahendran {{included}} Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei in {{his list}} of all-time favourite films. H.

Subha J. Rao and K. Jeshi of The Hindu placed the film in league with other successful comedy films like Kadhalikka Neramillai (1964), Thillu Mullu (1981) and Michael Madana Kama Rajan (1990).|$|E

5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an approach {{fast enough to}} escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the player character's death almost impossible, {{which meant that}} gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E

5|$|The name of Paulucci {{came back}} to the {{attention}} of the public in March 1848, along with that of General Latour, for the command of the Sardinian Army on the field, those being the only two generals of the entire force that had led troops in battle before. Both his age and bad health induced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a public refusal of the position, still never offered to him officially.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, Sasuke {{is shown}} as silent {{character}} who seeks to become stronger {{by any means}} in order to kill his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, for betraying and murdering their entire clan. Nevertheless, Sasuke is moved when Naruto Uzumaki wants <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with the village. As a result, Sasuke considers Naruto his only friend. By {{the end of the}} series, Sasuke becomes more kindhearted, but decides not to return to his home, choosing instead to redeem himself and search for an enemy threatening the peace in Konohagakure.|$|E
5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
