Reachable sets are defined in a reduced classical orbital element space. The boundary of this reduced space is obtained by extremizing a family of convex combinations of orbital elements. The resulting group of optimization problems is solved using a direct collocation pseudospectral technique by a MATLAB application package called DIDO. The reachable sets are examined to narrow the possible valid asteroid choices in order to aid in mission design and analysis of alternative targets.

40|$|Measurements of {{the bubble}} hydrodynamics {{were carried out}} in a cold {{pressurized}} bed with horizontal tubes. The mean bubble rise velocity, the bubble frequency, the mean pierced length, the bubble volume fraction, and the visible bubble flow rate were measured using capacitance probes. The absolute gas velocity through the bubbles was measured using Pitot-static pressure probes. The bed expansion ratio was determined by measuring the pressure difference between the freeboard and the bed at different heights and extrapolating the pressure difference down to zero. The fluctuations in the pressure drop over the entire bed height were also measured, and the power spectral density distribution of these fluctuations was calculated. The influence of pressure, fluidization velocity, and tube-bank geometry on the bubble behaviour and gas-flow distribution were studied. The bed has a cross-section of 0. 2 m x 0. 3 m. It was operated at pressures between 0. 1 and 1. 6 MPa, at <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocities</b> of 0. 2 and 0. 6 m/s. Three different tube-bank geometries were used, one with a fairly dense pitch and two with more sparse configurations, and comparisons are also made with previous results obtained without tubes in the bed. The bed material was silica sand with a mean particle diameter of 0. 7 mm. For the three tube banks investigated here, all the measured parameters except the mean pierced length consistently increased with increasing <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity.</b> The mean pierced length increased with increasing <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity</b> at low pressures, while the velocity effect at high pressures was less obvious. When the pressure was increased, the mean pierced length first increased to a maximum value, at p = 0. 4 MPa for the low <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity</b> and at p = 0. 2 MPa for the high <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity,</b> then decreased again as the pressure was increased further. The bubble frequency and the bed expansion increased as the pressure was increased. The absolute gas velocity through the bubbles {{as well as the}} gas velocity relative to the bubbles decrease as the pressure was increased. For the sparse tube banks at the lower <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity,</b> the mean bubble rise velocity, the bubble volume fraction and the visible bubble flow rate increased as the pressure was increased. For the dense tube bank, however, these parameters showed a maximum at p = 0. 4 MPa. At the higher <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity,</b> these parameters showed a maximum at about p = 0. 2 - 0. 4 MPa for all three tube banks. It appears that, at this velocity, the presence of tubes prevents a further increase in these parameters. This behaviour differs significantly from the behaviour without tubes. From the power spectral density distributions of the pressure fluctuations over the entire bed height and from visual observation, it appears that the bed is slugging, or close to slugging, at atmospheric pressure for all the tube configurations. When the pressure is increased, the power spectral density distribution becomes wider as the large bubbles/slugs break down and the bed moves toward a more dispersed bubbling behaviour...|$|R

The velocity field is obtained from laser Doppler anemometry measurements and the mean concentration field of the jet is measured by laser-induced fluorescence. A similarity analysis is performed on the radial profiles of mean velocity at successive streamwise stations. This is achieved by expressing the mean <b>velocities</b> as jet <b>excess</b> <b>velocities</b> over the ambient counterflow.

Bubble size observed above 600 K is much larger than that at 300 K. There is almost no difference in bubble size in a temperature range of 600 to 1000 K. 2. Under the conditions of 600 - 1000 K, large bubbles already exists even at low <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocities,</b> and only small increase in bubble size was observed with increasing <b>excess</b> gas <b>velocity.</b> 3. The relation between equivalent bubble size and eruption size of bubble is correlated by factor 1. 3.

40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} sediment transport by wind or water over an erodible bed shows that perturbations {{in a narrow}} range of wavenumbers are amplified, leading {{to the formation of}} ripples with a wavelength dependent on the roughness length of the bed. The roughness length is proportional to the grain size of the sand and the square of the <b>excess</b> shear <b>velocity</b> at the bed. We propose that this is the instability mechanism for the formation of eolian ripples. In addition, we propose that eolian dunes form by the same instability mechanism with the roughness of the bed at the dune scale proportional to the height of ripples. Similarly, megadunes form {{as a result of the}} same instability with the roughness length at the megadune scale proportional to the height of dunes. This model predicts that the spacing between eolian ripples, dunes, and megadunes increases linearly with grain size, quadratically with <b>excess</b> shear <b>velocity,</b> and that the ratio of megadune spacing to dune height, [...] ...|$|R

These objects may provide access to potential resources, as well as be potential scientific mission opportunities. A {{statistical approach is used}} to assess the fraction of the near-Earth object population with a given set of Keplerian elements. This is used to estimate the number of objects with the potential to fly-by the Earth with low relative velocities. The circular restricted three-body problem is then used to show that objects approaching Earth at low hyperbolic <b>excess</b> <b>velocities</b> can potentially be gravitationally captured at Earth. The Tisserand parameter, used as an approximation of the Jacobi constant, can be used to delimit the orbital regions from were low-energy transfers should be expected to exist and asteroids could possibly be transported at a minimum expenditure of energy. Finally, a semi-analytical approximation of the gravitational perturbation in the CR 3 BP is used to assess the feasible asteroid transport fluxes of capturable material that could be achieved by judicious use of Earth gravitational perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Recently Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) {{as a main}} {{propulsion}} system has been investigated as an option to support manned space missions to near-Earth destinations for the NASA Gateway spacecraft. High efficiency SEP systems are able {{to reduce the amount}} of propellant long duration chemical missions require, ultimately reducing the required mass delivered to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by a launch vehicle. However, for long duration interplanetary Mars missions, using SEP as the sole propulsion source alone may not be feasible due to the long trip times to reach and insert into the destination orbit. By combining an SEP propulsion system with a chemical propulsion system the mission is able to utilize the high-efficiency SEP for sustained vehicle acceleration and deceleration in heliocentric space and the chemical system for orbit insertion maneuvers and trans-earth injection, eliminating the need for long duration spirals. By capturing chemically instead of with low-thrust SEP, Mars stay time increases by nearly 200 days. Additionally, the size the of chemical propulsion system can be significantly reduced from that of a standard Mars mission because the SEP system greatly decreases the Mars arrival and departure hyperbolic <b>excess</b> <b>velocities</b> (V(sub infinity)) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{completely}} leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a hyperbolic trajectory {{relative to the}} departure planet is necessary, with <b>excess</b> <b>velocity</b> added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun.

To an inner destination planet, aphelion {{will be at the}} departure planet, and the <b>excess</b> <b>velocity</b> is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. Since interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in the heliocentric orbit between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories.

J 033241. 88 - 274853. 9 {{is found to}} be a blue, young (~ 320 Myr) stellar disk embedded in a very gas-rich (fgas= 73 - 82 % with log(Mstellar/Mo) = 9. 45) and turbulent phase that {{is found to be}} rotating on large spatial scales. We identified two unusual properties of J 033241. 88 - 274853. 9. (1) The spatial distributions of the ionized gaseous and young stars show a strong decoupling; while almost no stars can be detected in the southern part down to the very deep detection limit of ACS/UDF images, significant emission from the [OII] ionized gas is detected. (2) We detect an <b>excess</b> of <b>velocity</b> dispersion {{in the southern part of}} J 033241. 88 - 274853. 9 in comparison to expectations from a rotating disk model. We considered two disk formation scenarios, depending on the gaseous phase geometry. In the first one, we examined whether J 033241. 88 - 274853. 9 could be a young rotating disk that has been recently collapsed from a pre-existing, very gas-rich rotating disk. This scenario requires two (unknown) additional assumptions to explain the decoupling between the distribution of stars and gas and the <b>excess</b> of <b>velocity</b> dispersion in the same region. In a second scenario, we examine whether J 033241. 88 - 274853. 9 could be a merger remnant of two gas-rich disks. In this case, the asymmetry observed between the gas and star distributions, as well as the <b>excess</b> of <b>velocity</b> dispersion, find a common explanation. Shocks produced during the merger in this region can be ionized easily and heat the gas while preventing star formation. This makes this scenario more satisfactory than the collapse of a pre-existing, gas-rich rotating disk. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 8 pages & 5 figure...|$|R
