40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the effects of farm income variability, farm size, and other socio-demographic characteristics on the precautionary saving behavior of <b>farm</b> <b>households</b> and to estimate the influences of the identified factors on the amount of savings by self-employed <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using 2003 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data and a Double-Hurdle procedure, the likelihood and the amount of savings by <b>farm</b> <b>households</b> are estimated. Findings – An important empirical finding of this study is that variability in income plays an important role in explaining precautionary savings of US <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> Findings suggest that <b>farm</b> <b>households</b> facing higher income risk save more and accumulate more wealth. It is indicated that several <b>farm,</b> operator, <b>household,</b> and demographic attributes contribute to the precautionary savings of <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> In particular, results show that educational attainment by operator and spouses have positive impact on the decision to save. In addition, results from this study show that farms that specialize in cash grain are likely to have precautionary savings. Practical implications – <b>Farm</b> <b>households</b> today are virtually indistinguishable from non-farm households in their levels of income and diversity of employment. As a result, government policies that influence general economic conditions have much more profound impacts on farm families. Federal support of farm income warrants continued scrutiny. This paper shows that greater income uncertainty increases savings and wealth of <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> Therefore, <b>farm</b> policies that reduce income variability or uncertainty will have an impact on precautionary savings and wealth of <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> Originality/value – Several studies have investigated savings of households; however, these studies are limited to entire US population, older Americans, or non-self-employed individuals in the USA. Little is known about the savings behavior of self-employed US <b>farm</b> <b>households</b> owing to a lack of household survey data and because of the complex relationship between the <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> and <b>farm</b> business in terms of resource allocation (both capital and labor).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides new {{estimates of}} <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> efficiency and its determinants, and analyzes {{the determinants of}} technology adoption among smallholder farmers in Mozambique. ^ A translog stochastic frontier production function and a first difference model incorporating a model of <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> inefficiency effects are applied to test the existence of agricultural <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> inefficiencies and their determinants in Mozambique. Data were obtained from “Trabalho de Inquérito Agrícola” (TIA), a <b>farm</b> income <b>household</b> survey conducted in two agricultural seasons (2001 / 02 and 2004 / 05). The null hypothesis of equal <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> efficiency among households was rejected. ^ Variation in <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> efficiency indicates that access to agricultural technology is a severe constraint for most <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> <b>Farm</b> <b>household</b> efficiency varied widely across household and across provinces and agro-ecologies. Factors such as access to advisory services, access to rural credit, membership to an agricultural association, use of improved agricultural technology (irrigation, improved seeds, animal traction and chemical inputs) among others, were found to reduce significantly the level of <b>household</b> <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> inefficiencies. ^ Households with easy access to land tended to have low <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> efficiency indices. <b>Farm</b> <b>households</b> led by females were less efficient than male headed households. Empowering women is especially important because they provide most of the agricultural labor and are increasingly heading rural households. ^ Analysis of change of panel data indicates that the stochastic production frontier moved but many farmers did not catch up. Changes in access to extension, access to credit explain changes in the inefficiency change between 2002 and 2005. ^ Analysis of new agricultural technology adoption indicates that, holding other factors constant, households with access to agricultural advisory services, those with access to rural credit and members of agricultural associations {{are more likely to}} adopt new agricultural technologies. Changes in technology adoption are associated with changes in extension access and changes in credit access as well as initial status of <b>farm</b> <b>household</b> on access to credit and access to extension services. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to motivate, develop, and apply a new typology of U. S. <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> Household economic theory serves {{as the foundation for}} this typology. Using the 2003 Agricultural Resource Management Survey, cluster analysis identifies six mutually exclusive groups of U. S. <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> ^ The six mutually exclusive groups are: Single Income Ruralpolitan, Double Income Ruralpolitan, Active Seniors, Farm Operator with Spouse Working Off Farm, Traditional Farms, and Commercial Farms. Single and Double Income Ruralpolitan operators primarily work off the farm. Spouses also work off the farm for Double Income Ruralpolitans. Operators in the Active Seniors group are the oldest among all groups and they still work on the farm. The next group, Farm Operator with Spouse Working Off Farm, has the operator working on the farm and spouse working off the farm. Both operator and spouse work on the farm for Traditional Farms. Commercial Farms has the largest value of farm assets with the operator working on the farm. These six groups comprise the U. S. <b>Farm</b> <b>Household</b> Typology. ^ Descriptive statistics, pairwise t-tests, a stability index, and a discriminant function show that the U. S. <b>Farm</b> <b>Household</b> Typology is unique and identifiable. It is the contention of this dissertation that the U. S. <b>Farm</b> <b>Household</b> Typology allows for a richer discussion of U. S. farm policy. In particular, the impacts of government program payments on the farm labor and savings decisions of U. S. <b>farm</b> <b>households.</b> ^ Regression results show that decoupled government payments increase farm labor in a U.

This result supports the strong precautionary saving motives of <b>farm</b> <b>households</b> given the uncertainty of farm income. Finally, the savings decision is better explained by the U.
