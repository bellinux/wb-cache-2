40|$|The quintessential {{crime of}} the {{information}} age is identity theft, the malicious use of personal identifying data. In this paper we model identity and its use in credit transactions. Various types of iden-tity theft occur in equilibrium, including new account fraud, ex-isting account fraud,and friendly fraud. The equilibrium incidence of identity theft represents a tradeo ¤ between a desire to avoid costly or invasive monitoring of individuals on the one hand, and the need to control transactions fraud on the other. Our results suggest that technological advances will not eliminate this tradeo¤.

40|$|This article speculates on what society's {{response}} to crime {{will look like}} in the year 2020. Following a brief discussion of the anticipated criminal environment, and trends which will influence the delivery of public services, the article will suggest some of the forms which future institutions of crime control are likely to take. In addition to the transformation of Australian police services, the paper will discuss private and non- profit institutions of crime control, and how these will interact with public institutions. The paper will conclude {{with a discussion of}} trade-offs between personal safety and individual freedom, and how these will shift over time. It predicts greater societal investment in personal safety at the expense of individual freedom.

Many served as doctors, scholars, and craftsman, and gained positions of influence in society. On the other hand, like other non-Muslims, they did not work in Sharia Law since they did not have the obvious knowledge and qualifications for it.|$|R
