We investigated if TR 34 /L 98 H could have developed through exposure to DMIs. Methods and Findings: Thirty-one compounds that have been authorized for use as fungicides, herbicides, herbicide safeners and plant growth regulators in the Netherlands between 1970 and 2005, were investigated for cross-resistance to medical triazoles. Furthermore, CYP 51 -protein homology modeling and molecule alignment studies were performed to identify similarity in molecule structure and docking modes.

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{leads to}} delays and increased carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Traffic management {{measures such as}} providing information on <b>environmental</b> <b>route</b> costs have been proposed to mitigate congestion. Multi-criteria routing dynamic traffic assignment (MCR-DTA) models are needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of such measures. This paper presents a simulation-based bi-level optimization method to solve the MCR-DTA problem, which works as follows. Route costs include travel times and emissions, but those are updated inside two different loops. In the inner loop, emission costs are considered fixed; the assignment is performed by updating route travel times, using a traditional DTA tool. Then, in the outer loop, emissions are calculated based on link loads and fed back to the DTA tool, which performs a new assignment. The MCR user equilibrium is found when emissions or predefined generalized costs converge to an equilibrium. The bi-level method is first tested on a small network, showing that the proposed method is able to effectively solve the MCR-DTA problem. Next, the method is applied to a medium-size urban network. The results show that if drivers choose routes based on emissions besides travel time, the average travel time and emissions per vehicle decrease. This occurs because congested links have a higher impact on route costs; hence the equilibrium is pushed away from the single-criteria routing (SCR) user optimum towards the SCR system optimum. Results support the conclusion that informing drivers about CO 2 emissions per route can potentially lead to decreased delay and emissions in real networks. Transport and Plannin...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Azole {{resistance}} is an emerging problem in Aspergillus fumigatus and complicates {{the management of}} patients with Aspergillus-related diseases. Selection of azole resistance may occur through exposure to azole fungicides in the environment. In the Netherlands a surveillance network was used to investigate the epidemiology of resistance selection in A. fumigatus. METHODS: Clinical A. fumigatus isolates were screened for azole resistance in 8 university hospitals using azole agar dilution plates. Patient information was collected using an online questionnaire and azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates were analyzed using gene sequencing, susceptibility testing, and genotyping. Air sampling was performed to investigate the presence of resistant isolates in hospitals and domiciles. RESULTS: Between December 2009 and January 2011, 1315 A. fumigatus isolates from 921 patients were screened. A new cyp 51 A-mediated resistance mechanism (TR 46 /Y 121 F/T 289 A) was observed in 21 azole-resistant isolates from 15 patients in 6 hospitals. TR 46 /Y 121 F/T 289 A isolates were highly resistant to voriconazole (minimum inhibitory concentration >/= 16 mg/L). Eight patients presented with invasive aspergillosis due to TR 46 /Y 121 F/T 289 A, and treatment failed in all 5 patients receiving primary therapy with voriconazole. TR 46 /Y 121 F/T 289 A Aspergillus fumigatus was recovered from 6 of 10 sampled environmental sites. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the emergence and geographical migration of a voriconazole highly resistant A. fumigatus that was associated with voriconazole treatment failure in patients with invasive aspergillosis.
