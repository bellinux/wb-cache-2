50|$|Traditionally, a {{watermark}} {{was made}} by impressing a water-coated metal stamp or <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> onto the paper during manufacturing. The invention of the <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> in 1826 by John Marshall revolutionised the watermark process and {{made it easier for}} producers to watermark their paper.|$|R
50|$|Watermarks {{are created}} in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or bits, either {{attached}} to the mould or attached to the <b>Dandy</b> <b>roll</b> of machine-made paper. The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods. In {{the case of the}} mould, the watermark is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper. In the case of the <b>Dandy</b> <b>Roll,</b> the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp. The papermaker closely adjusts the pressure the <b>Dandy</b> <b>Roll</b> exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper. Too little pressure and the watermark may not be detectable.|$|R

50|$|A rare flaw {{in paper}} {{is when the}} {{watermark}} bit has been improperly repaired on the <b>Dandy</b> <b>roll.</b> Great Britain's Emblems watermark is composed of two roses, one shamrock and one thistle. A defect was created when the <b>Dandy</b> <b>roll</b> was repaired and instead of a thistle bit, a rose bit was added creating the three roses and a shamrock flaw. This flaw is found on Great Britain's 1862 3d (plate 2), 1865-67 3 d (plate 4), 6 d (plates 5 and 6), 9d (plate 4) and 1s (plate 4).|$|R
50|$|The <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> {{is a light}} roller {{covered by}} {{material}} similar to window screen that is embossed with a pattern. Faint lines are made by laid wires that run parallel to the axis of the <b>dandy</b> <b>roll,</b> and the bold lines are made by chain wires that run around the circumference to secure the laid wires to the roll from the outside. Because the chain wires are located {{on the outside of}} the laid wires, they have a greater influence on the impression in the pulp, hence their bolder appearance than the laid wire lines.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{watermark}} {{is called}} the cylinder mould watermark. It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a wire covering for the <b>dandy</b> <b>roll,</b> the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll's own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the <b>Dandy</b> <b>Roll</b> process, and as such Cylinder Mould Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where {{it is an important}} anti-counterfeiting measure.|$|R
50|$|For brevity {{these are}} known as 'Tudor Crown', 'St. Edward's Crown' and 'Crowns' respectively. The Tudor crown {{watermark}} was replaced because the <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> was worn, and the St. Edward's Crown watermark was replaced because of the introduction of Scottish regional issues and perceived sensitivities as Elizabeth is the first Elizabeth to rule Scotland not the second.|$|R
50|$|In comparison, {{machine-made paper}} is {{made on the}} Fourdrinier machine by drawing the furnish out of a vat onto an endless wire mesh. The paper, shortly after being drawn from the vat, is usually pressed with a <b>Dandy</b> <b>roll</b> as the {{mechanism}} to imprint a watermark onto the paper. Machine-made paper can produce single sheets of paper or one large continuous web of paper that is collected to form large rolls.|$|R
50|$|A {{watermark}} is an identifying {{image or}} pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness/darkness when viewed {{by transmitted light}} (or when viewed by reflected light, atop a dark background), caused by thickness or density variations in the paper.Watermarks have been used on postage stamps, currency, and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting. There are two main ways of producing watermarks in paper; the <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> process, and the more complex cylinder mould process.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{papermaking}} techniques use a <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> {{to create}} the laid pattern {{during the early stages}} of manufacture, {{in the same way as}} applying a paper watermark. While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is drained on a wire mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the wet stock, displacing the cellulose fiber. This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.|$|R
50|$|A {{watermark}} is {{a recognizable}} image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed {{with a light}} from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or <b>dandy</b> <b>roll</b> onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; {{as well as their}} use in security printing, they have also been used by papermakers to identify their product. Watermarks can also be made on polymer currency, for example, Australia has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly {{known as}} The Jack <b>Rolling</b> <b>Dandy's,</b> their debut album playlisted and charted on {{stations}} including 5fm, Tuks, Pukfm, VOWfm, MFM, RMR, Grind Radio,and many more. Their debut video, [...] "The Jack Rolling Dandy" [...] has also surpassed 20 000 views on youtube {{and is a}} former no.1 on MKtv.|$|R
5000|$|The Dandies {{formed in}} 2010 with Kaihl Thomas Meades {{tracking}} The Jack <b>Rolling</b> <b>Dandy</b> at Pinacle Records with producer Johan Fourie. Leading to the 2015 release of their debut album, [...] "Don't be a Can't" [...] which was tracked and mixed at Antimotion Studios by the renowned engineer and producer David Grevlar.|$|R
50|$|Another {{milestone}} for the group; {{along with}} the release of Mata Hati Telinga album was the introduction of The One Management and Organic Records. It was created to accommodate the group with a comprehensive, open, secure, proper and prestigious management; along with a record company that would give them as much freedom to explore their music. In addition through Organic Records, Maliq & D'Essentials assumed the role of executive producers for great new talents such as Twentyfirst Night, Boogiemen, Soulvibe, Renita, Djemima, Sir <b>Dandy,</b> Rock n <b>Roll</b> Mafia and The Upstairs.|$|R
50|$|Bette {{writes in}} her diary of her joy at <b>Dandy's</b> affections. He <b>rolls</b> in a cart of gourmet foods, and feeds Bette caviar. They watch a film in the Motts' private theater. Dot is not so easily deluded about their captivity. Dandy reads {{to them about the}} surgically-separated Brodie twins, and Dot realizes that Dandy can fund such a surgery for them. If she plays along, she may get to realize her dreams of stardom and Jimmy. Later on, the twins read about the death of one of the Brodie twins. Dot has reservations. Dandy interjects that they shouldn't have secrets between them. Dandy tells them that he is the true hero behind the death of Twisty. He insists that Dot tell him a secret, but she refuses, saying that he lied about Jimmy's role. Dandy flies into a rage.|$|R
