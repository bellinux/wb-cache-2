5|$|Georgia {{was again}} unable {{to earn a}} first down in the ensuing possession, and {{attempted}} three straight rushing plays that earned a total of sixyards. After a Georgia punt, Virginia Tech ran two rushing plays before attempting the same Royal pass that had <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown earlier. Georgia, having anticipated the play, sacked Royal for a loss of twoyards, ending the firsthalf.|$|E
5|$|She then {{played in}} the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, {{and was the first}} match to be shown live on free-to-air {{television}} in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first ball of the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 {{at the end of the}} 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.|$|E

He was forced to apologise to Sir Robert Grimston, a Deputy Speaker, when he wrongly accused him of joining a pressure group for commercial radio. He also often took up issues {{of human rights abuses}} in Spain. On 15 April 1963, Plummer died suddenly in New York City, where he had <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lecture tour.|$|E

25|$|As {{it turned}} out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, {{started off with}} a maiden over to Trescothick, and England {{struggled}} {{to get off the}} mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, and staring down the barrel.|$|E
25|$|Before the assassination, the British {{intelligence}} services identified Talaat in Stockholm {{where he had}} <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin where {{he was planning to}} return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in Germany. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the Royal Navy at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, find out {{what he was trying to}} accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict. This was achieved with the help of Aubrey Herbert.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, Fry's {{mental health}} started to {{deteriorate}} severely. He had encountered {{mental health problems}} earlier in his life, experiencing a breakdown during his final year at Oxford, which meant that, although academically brilliant, he achieved a poor degree. In the late 1920s, he had a major breakdown and became deeply paranoid. He reached breaking point in 1928 {{during a visit to}} India, becoming convinced that an Indian had cast a spell on him. For the rest of his life, he dressed in bizarrely unconventional clothes. He did recover enough to become a popular writer on cricket and other sports, and even into his sixties he entertained hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. At one point when he was staying in Brighton he was supposed to have <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> walk along the beach {{early in the morning and}} suddenly shed all his clothes, trotting around stark naked.|$|E

25|$|The Saints took {{an early}} 14–0 lead on a 6-yard pass from Archie Manning to tight end Larry Hardy and an 8-yard George Rogers run. A 51-yard Bill Capece field goal put the Buccaneers on the scoreboard. With a 14–3 lead {{late in the}} second quarter, Manning saw Hardy beat Mike Washington on a passing play, but Hardy ran an {{unexpected}} route, and Washington intercepted the pass. Doug Williams then hit Kevin House with a touchdown pass. A timeout controversy gave the Saints the ball with three {{seconds left in the}} first half. Neal Colzie, blinded from an earlier scratch to his eye, missed the coverage on Jeff Groth, who caught Manning's last-second pass that would have <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown if not for Norris Thomas' tackle on the 4-yard line. The Saints would not have a scoring opportunity {{for the rest of the}} game. Williams led the Buccaneers 75 yards to take the lead on the opening drive of the second half. Andy Hawkins prevented a first down on a fourth-quarter fake punt, setting up a 51-yard drive that left the score at 24–14. A later 96-yard fourth-quarter drive was the Buccaneers' longest to date. The win put the Buccaneers into a three-way tie for first place in the NFC Central division.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was much}} weaker {{than the other}} states in the 1960s and would not play in the Sheffield Shield until 1976–77, so {{the arrival of the}} MCC from the {{mainland}} was greeted with much anticipation. The captain of Tasmania was the wicketkeeper Len Maddocks, who had moved there from Victoria, but he lost the toss and M.J.K. Smith who rested some of his best players and decided to open the batting with Bob Barber. Smith top-scored with 96 and Jim Parks 91, though fellow-keeper John Murray was out for a duck. Colin Cowdrey made 63 and Barry Knight a quick-fire 45 not out. The fast-medium bowler Harold Allen took 3/63 and the leg-spinner Ken Flint suffered with 3/133. Smith declared on 371/9 and put Tasmania in to bat {{at the end of the}} first day, but they lost no wickets before stumps. They made steady progress, Kevin Brown and John Archer added 49 for the first wicket, Brian Richardson (112) made his maiden First Class century and Brian Patterson 67 not out, adding 48 for the last wicket with Flint (4) in a total of 322. Ken Higgs took 3/57 and Dave Allen 3/41. This was only a three-day game and Smith opened with Peter Parfitt late on the last morning. They added 46 for the first wicket, then Cowdrey (108), Parks (58) and Knight (51 not out) batted out the day with 289/7. It was the first tour match in which the MCC had not <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> win, a policy which continued for the last few games and this rubbed some of the shine off their earlier bright cricket.|$|E

500|$|Although Lennon {{had died}} in 1980, Starr said that the three {{remaining}} Beatles agreed they would pretend that Lennon had [...] "gone for lunch", or had <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cup of tea". The remaining Beatles recorded a track around Lennon's basic song idea, but which had gaps they had to fill in musically. Some chords were changed, and the arrangement was expanded to include breaks for McCartney and Harrison to sing extra lines. Harrison played slide guitar in the solo.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, {{many members}} of the cast and crew felt that the season was not the show's best.

Brian Baumgartner felt that the show [...] "stayed status quo , but without a key piece" [...] and [...] "didn't make a firm decision" [...] on the direction it was headed. Ben Silverman, one of the show's producers, said that [...] "it didn't have the sense of purpose and focus" [...] that the next season would have.|$|E

Once when he had <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song [...] "Chumma Chumma" [...] from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting {{a break in the}} film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was [...] "too far-fetched", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.|$|E
500|$|On 10October two {{replacement}} tyres {{were flown}} to Cocos Island to repair A84-202. The aircraft departed on the 12th {{of the month}} and flew to Christchurch via Laverton; its total flying time was 22hours and 23.5minutes. Cuming later told journalists that A84-202's crew had drunk beer and <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> swim while waiting for their aircraft to be repaired. Both Canberras later flew demonstration flights over Harewood Airport and RNZAF Base Whenuapai and returned to Laverton on 19October. The aircraft were transferred to No.1 Aircraft Depot on 2November {{to be returned to}} standard configuration, and No. 1 Long Range Flight's overseas detachments had all returned to Australia by 6November. The flight was disbanded on the 16th of the month.

500|$|The {{last few}} seasons were criticized for {{a dip in}} quality. The sixth season {{received}} criticisms {{for a lack of}} stakes for the characters. Other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the Jim and Pam romance. The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais wrote in his blog, referring to [...] "Search Committee," [...] particularly Warren Buffett's guest appearance, [...] "If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one", and compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras (although he later said on his website, [...] "I fucking didn't , that's for sure"). Some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of Steve Carell. Rainn Wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes [...] "creatively", such as the chemistry between Spader and Helms, which he called [...] "a bit dark" [...] and argued that the show should have <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] "brighter and more energized" [...] relationship. Despite this, there are later-series episodes that have received critical acclaim, including [...] "Stress Relief", [...] "Niagara", [...] "Garage Sale", [...] "Goodbye, Michael", [...] "Dwight Christmas", [...] "A.A.R.M.", and [...] "Finale".|$|E
