In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved. Now, {{in the course of}} those two months I often had pangs of consciousness. Volodya was {{suffering}} there alone, while I lived an ordinary life, was seeing people, visiting places. Now <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy.</b> For the poem that I've just heard wouldn't have been written should I have not chosen Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went up to}} my {{room and}} began to put a few things {{together}} in a suit-case. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy,</b> for several reasons. A visit to London, after my arduous weeks at Sanstead, was in the nature of an unexpected treat. My tastes are metropolitan, and the vision of an hour at a music-hall--I should be too late for the theatres--with supper to follow in some restaurant where there was an orchestra, appealed to me.|$|E
6000|$|Meditation, chief-justice, {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the bench. It contained the usual amount of legal ingenuity and logic, was esteemed as very eloquent in that part which touched on the sacred and inviolable character of the royal prerogatives (prerogativae as he termed them), and was so lucid in pointing out the general inferiority of the queen-consort, that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> her majesty was not present to hear herself and sex undervalued. As might have been expected, it allowed great weight to the distinction taken by the brigadier. The decision was in the following words, viz.: [...] "Rex et Regina versus No. 1, sea-water-color: ordered, that the officers of justice shall proceed forthwith to decaudizate the defendant before they decapitate him; provided he has not been forthwith decapitated before he can be decaudizated." ...|$|E
60|$|Jeeves {{projected}} {{himself into}} the room with the tea. I was jolly glad to see him. There's nothing like having a bit of business arranged for one when one isn't certain of one's lines. With the teapot to fool about with <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happier.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'appier</b> in my {{mind when}} I 'ad decided on that, and I went round to the Bear's Head and 'ad a pint. Arter that I 'ad another, and then I {{come back to the}} wharf and put the watch and chain on and went on with my work.|$|R
60|$|That second evening {{passed as}} sweetly as the first--more sweetly indeed: we enjoyed a {{smoother}} interchange of thought; old troubles were not reverted to, acquaintance was better cemented; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happier,</b> easier, more at home. That night--instead of crying myself asleep--I {{went down to}} dreamland by a pathway bordered with pleasant thoughts.|$|R
60|$|After dressing, we {{assembled}} in the eating-room or portico where we had supped, just when the red disk of the sun was showing itself above the horizon, kindling the clouds with yellow flame, and filling the green world with new light. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> and strong that morning, very {{able and willing to}} work in the fields, and, better than all, very hopeful about that affair of the heart. Happiness, however, is seldom perfect, and in the clear, tender morning light I could not help contrasting my own repulsively ugly garments with the bright and beautiful costumes worn by the others, which seemed to harmonize so well with their fresh, happy morning mood. I also missed the fragrant cup of coffee, the streaky rasher from the dear familiar pig, and, after breakfast, the well-flavored cigar; but these lesser drawbacks were soon forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... “I had a sore temptation,” said my poor lord. “Since I {{had come}} into this cursed title of Castlewood, which hath never prospered with me, I have spent {{far more than the}} income of that estate and my {{paternal}} one, too. I calculated all my means down to the last shilling, and found I never could pay you back, my poor Harry, whose fortune I had had for twelve years. My wife and children must have gone out of the house dishonoured, and beggars. God knows, it hath been a miserable one for me and mine. Like a coward, I clung to that respite which Holt gave me. I kept the truth from Rachel and you. I tried to win money of Mohun, and only plunged deeper into debt; I scarce dared look thee in the face when I saw thee. This sword hath been hanging over my head these two years. I swear <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> when Mohun’s blade entered my side.” ...|$|E
60|$|If I hadn't passed my {{word and}} raised their hopes, I doubt if I {{could have gone}} through with the {{undertaking}} {{but it was too}} late to go back now. So on the second day after Midsummer Day we went off by the morning mail. And when we came to the sea which I had never seen but once in my life and that when my poor Lirriper was courting me, the freshness of it and the deepness and the airiness and to think that it had been rolling ever since and that it was always a rolling and so few of us minding, made me feel quite serious. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> too and so did Jemmy and the Major and not much motion on the whole, though me with a swimming in the head and a sinking but able to take notice that the foreign insides appear to be constructed hollower than the English, leading to much more tremenjous noises when bad sailors.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{load off}} of my mind. My con-science told me I'd done right, and arter sending {{a little boy}} with a note to Ted Dennis to tell 'im not to come any more, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'appier</b> than <b>I</b> 'ad done for a long time. When I got to the wharf that evening it seemed like a diff'rent place, and I was {{whistling}} and smiling over my work quite in my old way, when the young policeman passed.|$|R
60|$|I had not {{actually}} entered the Shwedagon, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> just as <b>happy</b> as though I had.|$|R
60|$|Stanley {{laid his}} hand upon my shoulder, and his touch was inexpressibly soothing. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> light and <b>happy,</b> {{in spite of}} all.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was in high}} spirits, but {{the next}} moment trembled {{like a man with}} ague. I reached the orchard before my time. She was not there. You know {{what it is like to}} wait? I stood still and listened; I went to the point whence I could see farthest; I said to myself, 'A watched pot never boils; if I don't look for her she will come.' I walked up and down with my eyes on the ground. The {{sickness}} of it! A hundred times I took out my watch.... Perhaps it was fast, perhaps hers was slow--I can't tell you a thousandth part of my hopes and fears. There was a spring of water, in one corner. I sat beside it, and thought of the last time I had been there--and something seemed to burst in me. It was five o'clock before I lost all hope; there comes a time when you're glad that hope is dead, it means rest. 'That's over,' you say, 'now I can act.' But what was I to do? I lay down with my face to the ground; when one's in trouble, it's the only thing that helps--something to press against and cling to that can't give way. I lay there for two hours, knowing all the time that I should play the coward. At seven o'clock I left the orchard and went towards the inn; I had broken my word, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy....</b> I should see her--and, sir, nothing--nothing seemed to matter beside that. Tor was in the garden snipping at his roses. He came up, and I could see that he couldn't look me in the face. 'Where's my wife?' I said. He answered, 'Let's get Lucy.' I ran indoors. Lucy met me with two letters; the first--my own--unopened; and the second, this: ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the strings}} on my guitar broke, then I dropped the pick and that wasn't very professional. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> that I got a chance. I'd {{like to make}} it in this business. It was the dream of a lifetime. That's what it was. [...] - [...] Bernard Watson ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark when I at last {{turned back to}} our {{stricken}} camp, and my last vision as I went was the red gleam of Zambo's fire, the one point {{of light in the}} wide world below, as was his faithful presence in my own shadowed soul. And yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happier</b> than <b>I</b> had done since this crushing blow had fallen upon me, for it was good to think that the world should know what we had done, so that at the worst our names should not perish with our bodies, but should go down to posterity associated with the result of our labors.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>happy</b> too, but {{of course}} I didn't cry: [...] "big things" [...] never do, you know we leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think {{it must have been}} raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two on my cheeks.|$|R
500|$|Schembechler later {{recalled}} that he remained loyal to Elliott {{when he took}} over as Michigan's head coach in 1969. [...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to me again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happier</b> about anything in my life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Diamandis said of [...] "Radioactive":I wrote [...] "Radioactive" [...] in New York in {{the middle}} of a heat wave. Introduced to a {{glittering}} new nightlife, I fell in love with New York; it has this magic, fizzing white energy that no other city in the world has. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> and was inspired to write a song that felt light and euphoric, a more streamlined, minimalistic style of songwriting. I have changed my approach to songwriting completely, and as a result, written songs I would never have written on my own (i.e on my shit Argos keyboard alone in my bedroom in London).Musically, [...] "Radioactive" [...] is a Eurodance song with a minimalist club beat.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{sat down}} to rest and fell into a slumber, I thought I was back near my own native place, And roaming along by the bright crystal waters. The lovely blue waters of Castlefore Lake. I stood {{for a while to}} admire its beauty And turned my eyes to that sweet little space. The Island far out where wild birds go a-nesting On the lovely blue waters of Castlefore Lake. Then my gaze wandered up in another direction. To some {{beautiful}} swans, oh, what noise they did make. They splashed and they fluttered, but seemed quite contented On the lovely blue waters of Castlefore Lake. A boat being near me, I took the advantage To go for a sail to some different place, I sailed straight across and enjoyed the fresh breezes On the lovely blue waters of Castlefore Lake. On {{the opposite side of the}} lake I just landed. When I woke from my slumber in this far foreign place <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> and longed for to dream once again, on The lovely blue waters of Castlefore Lake".|$|E

On 3 April 1923, speaking at a Proletkult meeting, Mayakovsky made an attempt to define the poem's main idea which, apparently, remained unclear to many of his colleagues. [...] "Here everybody said how impossible it is to capture this poem's leitmotif. What you've heard were only fragments, but even from them the leitmotif is clear: it's the everyday life routines. Which haven't changed, and are still our worst enemy, making the philistines out of us." ...|$|E

60|$|We went on. Hugh's house lay {{before us}} in the moonlight, grown over by a tangle of vines. His garden was on our right, a quaint spot, full of old-fashioned flowers growing {{in a sort of}} disorderly sweetness. I trod on a bed of mint, and the spice of it floated up to me like the incense of some strange, sacred, solemn ceremonial. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> unspeakably <b>happy</b> and blessed.|$|R
5000|$|Boilerplate was {{originally}} featured on a website created by Paul Guinan in 2000. The Boilerplate site details {{the history of}} a remarkable robot built in the late 19th century, and features photoshopped [...] "archival images" [...] in which Boilerplate (actually a 12-inch articulated model) is seen interacting with historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt and Pancho Villa. [...] Becoming aware that some visitors to the site were taken in by its contents, making it an unintentional hoax, Guinan resolved to see how authentic he could make the character seem, working to ensure the descriptions of non-fictional events were accurate. He explained his motivation in a 2002 interview:"Certainly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> about having achieved my goal," [...] he said. [...] "I put this thing across as trying to be real, and people bought into it. So, that's a success! But, as an amateur historian, I feel a responsibility to get the story right. So I felt bad about some of these people being hoaxed. It was a mixed bag." [...] "But," [...] he revealed, [...] "I thought, if I was getting this reaction and I wasn't really trying, then what would happen if I really tried?"Guinan estimated that roughly a third of the site's visitors treated its faux history as real. Comedian Chris Elliott, while realising that Boilerplate was fictional, thought that the spoof dated back to the 19th century and included the character in one of his books (see below).|$|E
40|$|There {{is a part}} of Martin Luther King, Jr. 2 ̆ 7 s Letter from Birmingham Jail {{that always}} catches me up short, and which I now think of as {{at the heart of the}} essay: not King 2 ̆ 7 s civil disobedience, not his claim that an unjust law is not a law, but his anger at the {{character}} he termed the 2 ̆ 2 white moderate. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 It was bad, King said, when the public called him and his allies 2 ̆ 2 niggers 2 ̆ 2 and when the police hosed them down in the street. But what really pained King was that so many well-meaning whites stood by and did nothing. In fact, it was to these people that King was really addressing his letter. I remembered this part of King 2 ̆ 7 s letter again when reflecting on the AutoAdmit controversy-another controversy not without its share of racial epithets. I was pretty much a bystander to the whole thing. I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t the target of any vicious postings; I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t threatened, not personally, nor was my race or gender targeted. I didn 2 ̆ 7 t post anything on autoadmit. com myself (vicious, virtuous, or otherwise). Indeed, I hadn 2 ̆ 7 t really heard of AutoAdmit before the controversy erupted. For most of the drama, then-from the initial outrage, to the e-mail discussions and the meetings (none of which I attended) and then to the various scattered but coordinated responses-I was off to the side and off the stage, neither a victim nor an author of the threats. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happy</b> playing that role, happy to let things pass me by...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel like}} one," [...] I said laughing; and I ran {{to my room}} and did what I had never done before--wrote a second poem in the same day. I had to have some outlet for my feelings. I called it [...] "In Summer Days of Long Ago," [...] and I worked Mary Gillespie's roses and Cecil Fenwick's eyes into it, and made it so sad and {{reminiscent}} and minor-musicky that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> perfectly <b>happy.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes {{we passed}} houses and little settlements, but, {{for the most}} part, the country was as wild as undiscovered lands, which, being that to me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happier,</b> <b>I</b> am sure, than Columbus did when he first sighted {{floating}} weeds. Jone {{was a good deal}} wound up too, for he had never seen anything so beautiful as all this. We had our luncheon at a little inn, where the bread was so good that for a time I forgot the scenery, and then we went on, passing through the Forest of Dean, lonely and solemn, with great oak and beech trees, and Robin Hood and his merry men watching us from behind the bushes for all we knew. Whenever the river twists itself around, as if to show us a new view, old Samivel would say: [...] "Now isn't that the prettiest thing you've seen yet?" [...] and he got prouder and prouder of his river every mile he rowed.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2004, {{producer}} Lloyd Levin {{said that}} Cradle of Life had earned enough internationally for Paramount to bankroll a second sequel, but any hopes of it going into production were soon quelled by Jolie's announcement {{that she had}} no desire to play Lara Croft a third time.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so <b>happy,</b> though <b>I</b> knew I was a murderess. I didn't mind {{now whether}} I was hanged or not. To love Jack and be loved by him was quite enough for me.

5000|$|Artist Alex Ross drew {{upon his}} dislike of Liefeld's design of Cable when Ross {{designed}} the character Magog for the 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come. Following writer Mark Waid's instructions that the character's appearance {{be based on}} aspects of superhero design trends {{of the time that}} they disliked, Ross said of Cable, [...] "That's a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing from was - really only two key designs of Rob's - the design of Cable. I hated it. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character - the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what's with all the guns? But the thing is, when I put those elements together with the helmet of Shatterstar - I think that was his name - well, the ram horns and the gold, suddenly it held together as one of the designs that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>happiest</b> with in the entire series." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> so <b>happy</b> {{under my}} affliction since the trying {{moment of my}} first {{becoming}} conscious of it, as when he took my hand in his {{with a smile that}} has lighted my path in life from that day, and we sat down side by side.|$|R
60|$|The air of {{the night}} was very still, but dim with a {{peculiar}} mist, which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze. In this air, or this mist, there was some quality--electrical, perhaps--which acted in strange sort upon me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> then as <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{a year ago in}} England--on a night when the aurora borealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven, when, belated in lonely fields, I had paused to watch that mustering of an army with banners--that quivering of serried lances--that swift ascent of messengers from below the north star to the dark, high keystone of heaven's arch. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> not <b>happy,</b> far otherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.|$|R
60|$|Finally he {{went away}} in grief and anger. That was three weeks ago--and now I sat alone in the moonlit rose-garden and wept for him. But after a time my tears dried and a very strange feeling came over me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> calm and <b>happy,</b> as if some {{wonderful}} love and tenderness were very near me.|$|R

60|$|I do not {{say that}} I am a first-rate praying man, few hunters are, and as for Sir Henry, I never heard him speak like that before, and only once since, though deep down in his heart I {{believe that he is}} very religious.

Anyhow I do not remember, {{excepting}} on one single occasion, ever putting up a better prayer in my life than I did during that minute, and somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the <b>happier</b> for it. Our future was so completely unknown, and I think that the unknown and the awful always bring a man nearer to his Maker.|$|R
