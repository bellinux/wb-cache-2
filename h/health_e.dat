50|$|When the University of Ceylon was {{established}} in 1942, the General Hospital was chosen to be its teaching hospital. Paying wards such as Matapan Ward were established in 1943. 1952 saw the building of hospital kitchens and the first cardiothoracic unit. The hospital's first open-heart surgery took place in 1955. An electrocardiography (ECG) unit was opened on 1 November 1955. The College of Physiotherapy and School of Radiology, both affiliated to the General Hospital, were founded in 1957. The Bandaranaike Building (administration and surgery) was opened on 2 February 1958 by Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Eye care moved to the newly created Eye Hospital in 1965 and on 1 January 1967 an accident ward was opened in the vacated Victoria Memorial Building by Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. Ceylon's first intensive care unit was opened in the Surgical Complex by Minister of <b>Health</b> <b>E.</b> L. Senanayake on 16 June 1968. A mental health ward (Ward No. 59) was founded in the late 1960s. Plastic surgery was introduced in 1970 in Ward No. 4. The Coronary Care Unit was opened in 1973. The Burn Unit started on 28 October 1974 in Lady de Soysa Ward.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how perceived stress, social support, and home-based physical activity affected older adults ’ fatigue, loneliness, and depression. We also explored whether {{social support and}} physical activity mediated the relationships between stress and mental health problems. The data of 163 older participants were analyzed in this study. Structural equation modeling using LISREL 8. 71 was performed to assess the effects of stress, support, and physical activity on mental health. The findings indicate that perceived stress predicted higher levels of depression, social support predicted lower levels of loneliness and fatigue, and physical activity predicted lower levels of fatigue among older adults. Social support and physical activity mediated the relationships between stress and mental health, except depression. In conclusion, the relative impacts of perceived stress, social support, and physical activity on types of mental <b>health</b> (<b>e.</b> g., fatigue, loneliness, and depression) were different.

40|$|Research {{derived from}} terror {{management}} theory (TMT) suggests that conscious contemplations of mortality instigate efforts to remove such threatening cognitions from focal attention. Though efforts to manage death concerns in focal attention can positively affect one's <b>health</b> (<b>e.</b> g., engaging in health conscious behavior), such efforts can also negatively affect one's <b>health</b> (<b>e.</b> g., denying vulnerability to disease). The current research explores how {{individual differences in}} coping style and health optimism relate {{to the ways in}} which people respond to death-related cognitions in focal attention. Study 1 found that adaptive coping was associated with increased health behavioral intentions immediately after death thoughts were made salient (i. e., when death thoughts were still in focal attention) but not after a delay.

40|$|The {{mental health}} {{consequences}} of both dispositional forgiveness and forgiving one 2 ̆ 7 s abusive parents {{were examined in}} this study.

The {{results of the study}} support a conclusion that child abuse survivors purport better mental <b>health</b> (<b>e.</b> g., less anger, anxiety and depression) when they report higher levels of self forgiveness. However, it was found that higher levels of parental forgiveness actually predicted worse mental <b>health</b> (<b>e.</b> g., more anger, anxiety and depression) in abuse survivors. It may be that societal and moral pressure to forgive one 2 ̆ 7 s parents resulted in many of the survivors of abuse forgiving their parents before fully recognizing the extent of the abuse, acknowledging the emotional impact of the abuse, and making a conscious decision {{to let go of the}} anger association with the abuse (i. e., participating in the process of forgiveness) ...|$|E

Such an issue has led to requirements to improve and to evaluate the health performance of buildings. A proper health performance evaluation would aid tenants or purchasers to make a suitable decision, while also providing building owners and house sellers with useful information regarding the health performance of the buildings. The overall health performance of a building should not merely be a total evaluation score of factors, but a framework that reflects the characteristics and importance of each health-affecting factor. In addition, the overall health performance should include a concept that would enable the use of the tool to estimate and improve the health performance not only at the actual operational stage after completion of a building but over the entire lifecycle including planning, design and construction. To this end, a lifecycle health performance tree (LHT) for sustainable healthy buildings has been developed by this study. Unlike the existing method, which measures the indoor air quality, light and noise factors of a completed space, LHT provides an overall evalua-tion of the health performance of a space during planning...|$|R
