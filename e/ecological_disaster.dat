5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster.</b> The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|Dust Storm unites {{a classic}} {{image from the}} Great Depression with a {{contemporary}} industrial landscape, setting them in a cosmological orbit that is completed over {{the full spectrum of}} a year. The exploitation of oil that goes {{back to the beginning of}} the 20th Century is presented as the catalyst of conditions that led to the <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster</b> of Dust Bowl. But nothing is didactic. The pity in the subject comes to viewers subliminally through a visual poem of complexity and power.|$|E
25|$|Without this {{diversion}} project, the Aral Sea, once a body {{of water}} larger than any of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior, seemed destined to become the world's largest salt flat as early as the year 2010. By 1987 so much water had been siphoned off for irrigation of cotton and rice fields south and east of the sea that all shipping and commercial fishing had ceased. Former seaports, active as late as 1973, were reported to be forty to sixty kilometers from the water's edge. Belatedly recognizing the gravity of the situation for the 3 million inhabitants of the Aral region, government officials declared it an <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster</b> area.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of {{the genetic}} {{bottleneck}} theory (including Robock) suggest that the Toba eruption resulted in a global <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster,</b> including destruction of vegetation along with severe drought in the tropical rainforest belt and in monsoonal regions. For example, a 10-year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed the food sources of humans and caused a severe reduction in population sizes. Τhese environmental changes may have generated population bottlenecks in many species, including hominids; this in turn may have accelerated differentiation from within the smaller human population. Therefore, the genetic differences among modern humans may reflect changes within the last 70,000 years, rather than gradual differentiation over {{hundreds of thousands of}} years.|$|E
25|$|Apocalyptic {{fiction is}} {{concerned}} with the end of civilization through war (On the Beach), pandemic (The Last Man), astronomic impact (When Worlds Collide), <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster</b> (The Wind from Nowhere), or some other general disaster or with a world or civilization after such a disaster. Typical of the genre are George R. Stewart's novel Earth Abides and Pat Frank's novel Alas, Babylon. Apocalyptic fiction generally concerns the disaster itself and the direct aftermath, while post-apocalyptic fiction can deal with anything from the near aftermath (as in Cormac McCarthy's The Road) and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake to centuries in the future (as in Stephen Vincent Benét's By the Waters of Babylon and Octavia Butler's Lilith's Brood) to hundreds or thousands of years in the future, as in Russell Hoban's novel Riddley Walker and Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Finnish Maritime Administration {{announced}} that it would start planning a replacement for Voima. However, the new icebreaker that was expected to cost 100-120 million euro {{was not included in the}} budget proposals until 2012. While Arctia Shipping, the state-owned shipping company that operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet, stated that the company would prefer to replace the retiring traditional icebreakers with new multipurpose ships that could be chartered to support offshore drilling during the summer months, the Finnish Minister of Transport Merja Kyllönen voiced her opposition to a ship that would be 50% more expensive to build than a traditional icebreaker. There is also a growing public opposition to Arctic drilling which could result in an <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster</b> in case of a major oil spill. Some Finnish politicians have even proposed that instead of purchasing a new icebreaker to replace Voima, Finland should try to manage with a smaller icebreaker fleet and accept that some ports would likely be closed during the coldest winters.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Europeans arrived in the Arizona and Sonora Deserts, a region which they named Pimería Alta, the urban centers of the Hohokam had already become {{abandoned}} presumably due {{to the health and}} <b>ecological</b> <b>disasters</b> that befell the indigenous social system.

500|$|Only {{points on}} or within a PPF are {{actually}} possible {{to achieve in}} the short run. In the long run, if technology improves or if the supply of factors of production increases, the economy's capacity to produce both goods increases; if this potential is realized, economic growth occurs. That increase is shown by a shift of the production-possibility frontier to the right. Conversely, a natural, military or <b>ecological</b> <b>disaster</b> might move the PPF to the left {{in response to a}} reduction in an economy's productive capability. [...] Thus all points on or within the curve are part of the production set: combinations of goods that the economy could potentially produce.|$|E
