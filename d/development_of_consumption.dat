The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify the effect of consumption, investment, taxation, government spending, consumption of the previous period, the interest rate and disposal revenue to GDP in West Sumatra. The study was conducted with descriptive and associative with the use of secondary data in the form of time series, 1994 - 2010. The results on the First Hypothesis suggests that the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> the development of investment and the development of government spending together influential significantly to economic growth. Partially, the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> and the growth of government spending significantly and positively to affect economic growth, then the development of a positive and significant effect of investment on economic growth. In the Second Hypothesis together previous period consumption growth and development of disposibel income and significant positive impact on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> Partially, the previous period consumption growth and positive impact on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> was not significant and influential positive revenue development disposibel and significant to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> Then on the Third Hypothesis jointly the credit interest rate of investment and economic growth has no effect on the development of significant investment. Partially, credit interest rates negatively and significant investment toward the development of investment and economic growth has positive influence on the development and significant investment. The Fourth Hypothesis proved to be influential economic growth on the development of the tax was not significant in West Sumatra. Government efforts need to be able to continue to increase government spending or reduce taxes by increasing the production of regional output. In addition to government efforts are needed to further improve the quality of human resources by providing education and training, scholarships and employment opportunities in labor- intensive system. To overcome the problem of development of investment the government needs to take expansionary monetary action is by controlling interest rates in order to increase investment development...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> {{when there are}} {{interactions}} between consumers. The consumer recognizes three reference groups: peer, distinction, and aspiration. The interplay of aspiration and distinction can lead to `waves' in consumption; for example, the avant-garde consumption of up-market pioneers is copied by other types of consumer. As the latter aspire to emulate the former, the former seek distinction by varying their consumption. A consumption activity may start up market, then gradually descend the social spectrum. More complex patterns with continuing cycles in consumption can also be found. ...|$|E

Unless we change course in how we produce and consume, severe consequences for life on this Planet in the future are likely to follow. Based on that background, this paper looks at one area <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> namely food, and analyses a particular market within this area which causes high environmental pressures, i. e. the meat market.

The behaviour of the typical or average consumer did not lead to the consensus with the hypothesis of proportionality in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> and income. Also the hypothesis that consumption remains at the same level, when prices rise, was not accepted.

An {{estimate of the}} consequences of life-style trends for future energy use is also made. The robustness of specific trends in energy use can be helpful in setting priorities for energy saving policies. Therefore, it is important that policy makers have an indication of the range in <b>development</b> <b>of</b> domestic energy <b>consumption.</b> Firstly, the interaction between technological development and consumer behaviour is assessed by screening several theoretical concepts as well as examining empirical evidence. Subsequently, actual robust trends in consumer technology and life-styles are investigated and assessed in terms of likely consequences for developments in ownership and use of such new appliances in addition to residential electricity <b>consumption.</b> The assessment <b>of</b> the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> future electricity <b>consumption</b> depends on historical trends and on the type of model used. Therefore, the historical <b>development</b> <b>of</b> domestic electricity <b>consumption</b> is analysed. The objective of this analysis is to identify the factors which determine the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> residential electricity <b>consumption.</b> Secondly, the methods and results of some forecasting studies in the Netherlands are compared.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} two-point view, economic and marketing, on advertising and its potential influence on consumption. Consumption patterns that have been developing in time are now a subject to influence of economic crisis. Economic crisis as well as advertising are some of the factors that can accelerate the development or change the direction of <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns. A debate on effects of these factors is carried on in the paper. First, there are underlined approaches to consumption and evolution of consumption patterns. A distinct element from the traditional view is the endogeneity of tastes and preferences, and the process of their creation. The potential influence of advertising, especially on demand increase, will be examined and the essence of the phenomenon will be underlined. This general theme will be specified and examined in more concrete field of interest â economic crisis. Both approaches are aimed at a nowadays problem of economic crisis, i. e. economic-marketing view on the role of advertising under the conditions of present crisis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} evolvement of water {{footprint}} assessment (WFA) {{as a new}} research field over the past fifteen years. The research is rooted in four basic thoughts: (1) there is a global dimension to water management because water-intensive commodities are internationally traded, so we must study virtual water trade {{and the effects of}} countries externalizing their water footprint; (2) freshwater renewal rates are limited, so we must study the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> production and trade patterns in relation to these limitations; (3) supply-chain thinking, previously uncommon in water management, can help to address sustainable water use from the perspective of companies and final consumers; and (4) a comprehensive approach requires the consideration of green in addition to blue water consumption, the traditional focus in water management, and the analysis of water pollution in the same analytical framework as well. The quick emergence of the new field and wide uptake of the water footprint concept in society has generated substantial discussion about what the concept in narrow sense and the research field in broader sense can offer and what not.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the material cultural and social practices found in Spanish one-act plays whose fictional space was developed in the most important urban centers of 17 th century Spain. I focus on how the trends of diversion and consumption determined the comic elements of the plays during that time in the public, domestic, exotic, and marginal spaces. This analysis illuminates the anxieties associated with the behavioral changes provoked by the new habits that emerged in a new society of consumers. The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> in the society of the late Habsburgs was accompanied by a proliferation of novelties and a multiplication of meanings and social practices associated with these objects. The analysis of the one-act plays suggests that goods and each particular space were a mark of social relationships, indicator of a determinate symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 1984, 1999) and creator, consequently, of a series of behaviors or everyday practices (De Certeau 1988; Lefebvre, 1991), where one could read a cultureâs class structure or power relations from a telling particular artifact or event (Auslander, 1996; Fumerton 2 Ì 6 Hunt, 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This article {{looks at}} how {{young people in}} post-communist Estonia {{attribute}} meaning to consumer goods and to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> during the last decade. The empirical material comprises 45 qualitatively analysed student essays and 25 in-depth interviews. The authors arrange the material onto two main axes: the temporal axis of Estonian transformation and the spatial axis of Estonia (including the memory of Soviet Estonia) versus todayâs construct of the West. Also, we look at how âWestern-nessâ as a socio-cultural reference point is used by young people in representing consumption. We argue that the decoding of Western consumer culture is ambivalent for Estonian youth as it brings up national collective ideals of freedom as well as highly individual distinction-seeking. Value references ranging from more traditional to âpost-modernâare inextricably interwoven in representations of todayâs consumption processes. Plural processes are at work among the studied students: having {{a strong desire to}} distance oneself from the Soviet heritage and to view âWestern-nessâas the only alternative,while at the same time criticizing the adoption of the Western consumer capitalist model. This is manifested in a willingness to âoutsmartâthe Western consumer by using experiences from the Soviet period as well as Estonian ethnocultural heritage.
