500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a {{scientific}} observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. [...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> made a sharp turn to the right {{so that we would}} not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E

500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, {{conductor}} Robert Ziegler, {{who worked}} with Radiohead on The King of Limbs, tweeted photos of the band recording with a string orchestra. The strings and choir sections were arranged by Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra with conductor Hugh Brunt; the orchestra had previously worked with Greenwood on his score for the 2012 film The Master. The strings were recorded at RAK Studios in London. Cellist Oliver Coates said: [...] "Nigel, Jonny and Thom all have this awesome relationship, and were so animated during the recording. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> were laying down the cello part {{at the end of}} 'Daydreaming' and Thom said, 'That's it – that is the sound of the record.'" [...] Greenwood had the cellists detune their cellos for the song, creating a [...] "growling" [...] sound. Additional string and choir parts were recorded but cut from the album.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one kid, at the time. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win. Because this was like a dream come true on the sand beaches in the Bahamas." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jerry lay quiet without {{speaking}} {{for a few}} minutes, then he said: [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now; <b>we</b> were capsized. I had hold of the canoe, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> seeing a rock just ahead. I suppose I knocked against it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dan's {{interest}} in films was nurtured {{early in life}} because his parents owned a movie theater. Dan also claimed to have discovered his {{interest in}} S/M very early in life: [...] "I even liked {{this kind of thing}} in kindergarten. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> had a lovely young teacher in her early twenties. More than anything in the world, I wanted to tie her up." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> {{were doing}} a {{tracking}} shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} we were called before," [...] he said; [...] "but from what <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>I</b> fancy <b>we</b> had about what I have been using for my private delectation. Just enough for my mother and you to be jolly upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite young, I grieve to say; {{and all of}} my {{brothers}} and sisters that you see here are practically my own age. If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> rightly, <b>we</b> were sixty-six years old the day before yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We've met, haven't we? Oh yes, <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>We</b> met {{at lunch}} once. And you sent me some flowers. It was ever so kind of you,' she said, beaming.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{five years}} ago," [...] said the Senor modestly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> kept {{well to the}} west to weather Cape St. Eugenio. My {{impression}} {{is that there was}} a strong northwesterly current setting north of Ballenos Bay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very {{good stuff}} it was too,' said Parnesius calmly. 'We mended three shoulder-straps here {{and had a}} spear-head riveted. The Forge was rented from the Government by a one-eyed smith from Carthage. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> called him Cyclops. He sold me a beaver-skin rug for my sister's room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{she read}} it to father and me down by the cove," [...] said Sally, [...] "the {{afternoon}} that you {{came home from the}} Banks; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> how <b>we</b> saw you coming in; don't you, Mara?" ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. Yet <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> before <b>we</b> {{went into}} {{action for the}} first time--I suppose the fear of death was upon me--some of them were making their wills--I have no near relative--I left {{everything}} to these two ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, as this {{settlement}} escaped plunder, I {{should think}} its {{people may have}} done something by selling supplies to the army. Provisions of all kinds were very high and scarce, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> when <b>we</b> met Burgoyne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Featherstone, [...] "and, {{to say the}} truth, the American hoop-skirts are {{the only}} ones fit to wear.

6000|$|... 'It is {{very good}} of them,' Dorothy said. 'I was {{wondering}} vaguely while I was taking the soup where it had come from, and {{could not make out}} what you meant by the stretchers and mules, because <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> sent those that we came up on, back to the hotel.

60|$|One summer evening, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>we</b> {{were sitting}} in his rooms, and during a silence there came to us {{through the open window}} the moaning of the city, as of a tired child.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> as <b>we</b> {{sat in a}} Canadian canoe, in a reedy, bush-masked shallow we had {{discovered}} operating out of that pine-shaded Woking canal, how she fell talking {{of the things that}} happened to her before she met me again....|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>we</b> passed two Germans, {{an old man}} and a tall fair girl, {{father and}} daughter, who were walking down from Saas. She came {{swinging}} and shining towards us, easy and strong. I worshipped her as she approached.|$|R
60|$|This is {{obviously}} erroneous, though I have not the means at hand {{to ascertain the}} true number. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>we</b> were all astonished at the uncommonly large proportion of dead to wounded--a consequence of the uncommonly close range at {{which most of the}} fighting was done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course; I quite {{agree with}} him. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> had a confounded poet at Larissa who proved my family lived before the deluge, {{and asked me}} for a pension.

6000|$|... "Ay! ay! to be sure. <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>We</b> {{were both}} {{engaged in the}} serious {{business}} of croquet at the time--and it was doubtful which of us did that business most clumsily.

6000|$|... "He was in Gown Boys, I know," [...] {{says the}} boy; [...] "succeeded his uncle Pitt, fourth Baronet. I don't know how his mother--her {{who wrote the}} hymns, you know, and goes to Mr. Honeyman's chapel--comes to be Rebecca, Lady Crawley. His father, Colonel Rawdon Crawley, died at Coventry Island, in August, 182-, and his uncle, Sir Pitt, not till September here. <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>we</b> {{used to talk about}} it at Grey Friars, when I was quite a little chap; and there were bets whether Crawley, I mean the young one, was a Baronet or not." ...|$|E

60|$|A moment later, with peals {{of happy}} laughter, {{we had taken}} hands and were running along the garden alleys towards the house.
