5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a <b>Keplerian</b> <b>orbit,</b> measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

40|$|The Wisdom–Holman {{algorithm}} {{is an effective}} method for numerically solving nearly integrable systems. It {{takes into account the}} exact solution of the integrable part. If the nearly integrable system is the solar system, for example, the Wisdom–Holman algo-rithm uses the solution consisting of <b>Keplerian</b> <b>orbits</b> obtained when the interplanetary interactions are ignored. The effectiveness of the algorithm lies in its ability to take long timesteps. We use the Duffing oscillator and Kepler’s problem with forcing to deduce how long those timesteps can be. For nearly <b>Keplerian</b> <b>orbits,</b> the timesteps must be at least six per orbital period even when the orbital eccentricity is zero. High eccentricity of the <b>Keplerian</b> <b>orbits</b> constrains the algorithm and forces it to take shorter timesteps. The analysis is applied to the solar system and other problems.

25|$|The VLBI radio {{observations}} of Sagittarius A* {{could also be}} aligned centrally with the images so S2 could be seen to orbit Sagittarius A*. From examining the <b>Keplerian</b> <b>orbit</b> of S2, they determined the mass of Sagittarius A* to be 2.6 ± 0.2 million solar masses, confined in a volume with a radius no more than 17 light-hours (120 AU). Later {{observations of}} the star S14 showed {{the mass of the}} object to be about 4.1 million solar masses within a volume with radius no larger than 6.25 light-hours (45 AU) or about 6.7 billion kilometres. They also determined the distance from Earth to the Galactic Center (the rotational center of the Milky Way), which is important in calibrating astronomical distance scales, as 8.0 ± 0.6 × 103 parsecs. In November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of a potential intermediate-mass black hole, referred to as GCIRS 13E, orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*. This black hole of 1,300 solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars. This observation may add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars.|$|E
