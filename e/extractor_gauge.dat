In order to characterize the vacuum in these guns, an <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge</b> and a residual gas analyzer have been incorporated into each gun. The purpose of this tech note is to document the gun vacuum measurements performed in the CEBAF polarized electron guns during tests made in February 2003, and to compare this with the previous vacuum measurements made in the electron guns throughout their evolution. The results of these measurements, suggesting that the raw <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge</b> readings are 7 x 10 - 12 and 4 x 10 - 12 for guns 2 and 3 respectively, {{are at least as}} good as any previous measurement of the vacuum in these systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a CNT emitter-based <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge</b> which is designed for pressure readingin cryogenic ultra-high vacuum systems. The results showthat the modified gauge works well in both room temperatureand cryogenic vacuum environments. Furthermore, it couldbe demonstrated that the modified gauge responds muchmore sensitive to small pressure fluctuations in cryogenicenvironments than the same gauge type having a hot-filamentcathode...|$|E
30|$|The MWNT film {{is grown}} {{directly}} on the 304 S.S. without extra catalyst layer by the CVD technique from C 2 H 2 /Ar source gases at 750  °C. To improve the field emission properties, the S.S. substrate is anodized in the 0.3  mol L− 1 oxalic acid solution. The field emission properties are compared for regular and anodized MWNT emitters from the diode setup. By screwing the parts together without any adhesive material, MWNT electron source is developed from totally mechanical assembly with features of low outgassing rates, good emission stability, and the feasibility to replace the MWNT cathode. The MWNT field emission ionization gauge is constructed upon the <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge.</b> The gauge performances are investigated inside a turbo vacuum system with 10 − 11  Torr background vacuum, and the pressure is calibrated against a commercial IE 514 <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge.</b> The measurement linearities are investigated for N 2, H 2, and O 2, respectively, in wide pressure ranges. Keithley multimeters are used to supply the operation potentials and measure ion and electron currents.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} several low cost {{computer}} controlled residual gas analyzers (RGAs) {{have been introduced}} into the market place. It would be very useful to know the performance characteristics of these RGAs {{in order to make}} an informed selection for UHV applications. The UHV applications include extreme sensitivity helium leak detection and monitoring of the residual gas spectra in UHV systems. In this article, the sensitivity and linearity data for nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium are presented in the pressure range 10 {sup {minus} 8 } [...] - 10 {sup {minus} 1 } Pa. Further, the relationships between focus voltage and ion currents, relative sensitivity, and fragmentation factor are also included. A direct comparison method is used in obtaining this data. Spinning rotor and <b>extractor</b> <b>gauges</b> are the transfer standard gauges used in Jefferson Lab's vacuum calibration facility, with which all the reported measurements here were carried out...|$|R

40|$|An <b>extractor</b> type {{ionization}} <b>gauge</b> {{has been}} developed for flange mounting in a 15. 7 mm diam. aperture. The gauge electrodes are aligned by ceramic plates. A cylindrical anode grid of 9 mm diam. and 12. 5 mm length is formed of photo-etched W-sheet. A thoria coated W-filament is employed made from two semicircular loops mounted outside and concentric with the anode grid. The two halves of the filament are connected in parallel. The height of the electrodes {{from the top of}} the anode grid to the base of the hemispherical collector is 18. 9 mm. The gauge design is a compromise between obtaining a low X-ray or pressure limit, high sensitivity and high electron emission current. The foregoing, given in the same order, were respectively 5 * 10 /sup - 12 / torr; 5 torr/sup - 1 / for N/sub 2 / at 10 mA emission current and 6 torr/sup - 1 / at below 5 mA; and an emission current of between 5 - 10 mA which gave the high anode current density required to maintain a clean grid.

40|$|Attempts {{at using}} the Spindt-type {{molybdenum}} field emitter arrays in the <b>extractor</b> <b>gauge</b> (EG) and residual gas analyzer (RGA) {{are presented in}} this paper. The sensitivity of the field emitter gauge (FEG) {{is as high as}} 11 Torr{sup {minus} 1 }. There is an excellent measurement linearity for FEG and the linear deviation is smaller than 10 % in the pressure range of 10 {sup {minus} 11 } [...] 10 {sup {minus} 6 }Torr. We achieved quite stable sensitivities for nitrogen, helium and hydrogen with the field emitter RGA (FERGA) below 10 {sup {minus} 7 } Torr. The slightly reduced emission current and sensitivity, after long-term operation, are of concern and need to be addressed. Residual gas spectra indicate that when using field emitters, the electron stimulated desorbtion (ESD) ions (O+, F+ and Cl+) are lower than those of hot filament generated spectra...|$|E
