5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the office already knew about it.|$|E
25|$|Molly Miles: Molly is the preteen {{daughter}} of Mr. and Mrs. Miles. Like <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her family, she has red or auburn hair and freckles. She {{is a big}} fan of Star Wars, Clint Eastwood, and movies in general. She has a best friend, Tyler, on whom she develops a crush as she got older, though he is unaware of her feelings. Molly is the one who has probably warmed the most towards Zoey, aside from her mom, and is trying to be the best big sister to her.|$|E
25|$|Bronx native Nancy Savoca's 1989 comedy, True Love, explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in {{the days}} before their wedding. The film, which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's Sundance Film Festival. The CBS {{television}} sitcom Becker, 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tut, tut, Martha,' {{rejoined the}} locksmith; 'don't take offence at nothing. I mean, how strange {{it is of}} you to run down volunteering, when it's done to defend you {{and all the other}} women, and our own fireside and <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> <b>in</b> case of need.' ...|$|R
50|$|Gus & Waldo’s Book of Sex is a wry {{and witty}} {{look at our}} attitudes to our own sex lives and <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s.</b> <b>In</b> a similar way as in their {{previous}} two books, by mocking all the fads, myths and paraphernalia that are often associated with today’s approach to sex, Gus and Waldo expose the reality of all of this: all nice games, but {{not a substitute for}} love.|$|R
60|$|On the contrary, by some {{peculiar}} {{course of}} reasoning, he had convinced himself that whenever {{he lost a}} thing it was <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> fault <b>in</b> the house but his own.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosives}} fail to {{kill the}} rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits {{make their way to}} the general store, killing housekeeper Mildred (Francesca Jarvis) and eating <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the small town of Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody (Paul Fix) on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the National Guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of Ajo and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.|$|E
2500|$|A free agent, Martínez did {{not sign}} {{with a major}} league team during the winter. In March, he joined the Dominican Republic's squad for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, {{in an attempt to}} {{showcase}} his arm. Martínez pitched six scoreless innings with 6 strikeouts and no walks, but the team was quickly eliminated from the tournament and no MLB contract was forthcoming. In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Martínez told reporters, [...] "I would just like to be the backup. If I could be the backup, that would be a great thing to have—a healthy Pedro behind <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> <b>in</b> case something happens. That would be a great feeling to have on a team, eh?" ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{taking a}} {{traditional}} position on human sexuality, maintaining the Church's moral opposition to homosexual acts, John PaulII asserted {{that people with}} homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> his book Memory and Identity {{he referred to the}} [...] "strong pressures" [...] by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: [...] "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family." [...] A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality.|$|E

6000|$|... 'And I,' said Gerald grimly, 'shouldn't {{like to be}} in a {{world of}} people who acted {{individually}} and spontaneously, as you call it. We should have <b>everybody</b> cutting <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> throat <b>in</b> five minutes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Mother Angelica {{publicly}} criticized Cardinal Roger Mahony, {{then the}} archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, for his pastoral letter on the Eucharist called [...] "Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass", which she perceived had a lack of emphasis on transubstantiation: [...] "I'm afraid my obedience in that diocese would be absolutely zero. And I hope <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> <b>in</b> that diocese is zero". Cardinal Mahony regarded her comments as accusing him of heresy. Mother Angelica later issued a conditional apology for her comments.|$|R
2500|$|These {{discussions were}} {{reported}} to the House of Commons by Thorneycroft, leading to a storm of protest. Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey pointed out that while Skybolt had suffered five test failures, Polaris had thirteen failures in its development. He went on to state [...] "that some of us on this side, {{who want to see}} Britain retain a nuclear deterrent, are highly suspicious of some of the American motives... and say that the British people are tired of being pushed around". Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond asked: [...] "Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case that <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country? Is it not the case that the Americans gave up production of the B52, which was to carry Skybolt, nine months ago?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Oh, totally! ...totally...and {{in those}} days we, like <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> I guess I could say that we were naive, but then so was <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> ah, <b>in,</b> ah, taking the Communists at face value...on {{the basis of what}} they had done up to that point...which was pretty good, pretty positive. We had no notion of what a {{nightmare}} they were going to create.|$|R
50|$|A {{member of}} the Klan, John W. Brothers, was arrested and turned State's {{evidence}} by telling on <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> involved <b>in</b> Klan activity. A dozen of the Klan members had warrants issued against them, but only four—Bill Smoot, John Onan, Meffert, and A. W. Hall—were captured.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can't have {{rushed out}} to get the start of <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> and put <b>in</b> that bill of sale at Lammle's?' said Fledgeby. 'Say you haven't, Mr Riah.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then let us part friends!" [...] said Holgrave, {{pressing}} her hand. [...] "Or, if not friends, let us part before you entirely hate me. You, who love <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pa doesn't {{like us to}} get up too early," [...] it continues. [...] "He says <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> {{the house}} is liable to be {{disturbed}} if we get up. So, of course, we mustn't." ...|$|E

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{advantage}} of visualizing the ideal process of PTA and stent placement, the interdisciplinary meeting assisted in stratifying common misconceptions and eradicating misunderstandings and miscommunications concerning steps carried out, especially by other staff involved in the process: By better understanding <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s</b> responsibilities <b>in</b> the process {{we were able to}} organize the process itself more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Konjić {{spent the}} first eight months of the Bosnian War in his country's army. After his {{military}} discharge he trained in the streets, often during artillery raids when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> was covering <b>in</b> bomb shelters or cellars.|$|R
6000|$|... "A week? How splendid! Oh, I've such heaps to tell {{and show}} you; come right {{over to my}} cubby and see how lovely it is," [...] said Jill, forgetting <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her delight at getting Molly.|$|E
6000|$|... "But all {{the folks}} {{are talking about}} it, Eb. And mother is {{fretting}} her heart out over it. Father has never acted like himself since these meetings began. He just goes there night after night, and sits like a mummy, with his head down. And almost <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Avonlea has testified." ...|$|E
6000|$|He did not conceal that he {{had been}} greatly struck by her appearance. Nobody could have helped being impressed. She was {{different}} from <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> that house, and it was not only the effect of her London clothes. He did not take her down to dinner. Willie did that. It was afterwards, on the terrace. [...] .|$|E
5000|$|Originally, Vs. {{was titled}} Five Against One, which {{was taken from}} the lyric [...] "One, two, three, four, five against one..." [...] from [...] "Animal". Concerning the {{original}} album title, Gossard said:"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record...Your own independence—your own soul—versus <b>everybody</b> <b>else's.</b> <b>In</b> this band, and I think in rock in general the art of compromise is almost as important as the art of individual expression. You might have five great artists in the band, but if they can't compromise and work together, you don't have a great band. It might mean something completely different to Eddie. But when I heard that lyric, it made a lot of sense to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|I said {{repeatedly}} the Iron Throne is huge. It towers {{over the room}} like a great beast. And it's ugly. It's asymmetric. It's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacturing. You have to walk the iron steps, and when a king sits on it he's like 10 feet above <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> ... He's <b>in</b> this raised position looking down on everyone.|$|R
60|$|This {{will be a}} hasty letter, for I am {{as badly}} off in this place as in America--beset by {{visitors}} at all times and seasons, and forced to dine out every day. I have found, however, an excellent man for me--an Englishman, who has lived here many years, and is well acquainted with the people, whom he doctored in the bad time of the cholera, when the priests and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> fled <b>in</b> terror.|$|R
6000|$|He {{squeezed}} his thin lips {{together for a}} silent moment and then retorted. [...] "You've got nothing of the sort, nothing of the sort.

6000|$|... "No, {{they are}} quiet for the present, though the accursed missionaries of the London Society {{are doing their}} best to stir them up," [...] and he made a sign to me to cease from asking questions, nor did I say any more till we had gone to bed and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the house was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Rob {{was a big}} puppy, in {{the first}} place, and then he {{grew up to be}} a tall, long-legged dog, who was not only very fond of Harry and Kate, but of almost <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> time he filled out and became rather more shapely, but he was always an ungainly dog--"too big for his size," [...] as Harry put it.|$|E
6000|$|It grew {{darker and}} darker and blacker and blacker, while I {{struggled}} with those awkward sixth-century clothes. It {{got to be}} pitch dark, at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky. At last the eclipse was total, and I was very glad of it, but <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> misery; which was quite natural. I said: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Heartbeat Song" [...] {{was written}} by Mitch Allan, Audra Mae, Kara DioGuardi, and Jason Evigan in a two-day session writing camp. In an {{interview}} on Entertainment Tonight, Mae revealed that DioGuardi {{came up with the}} main idea and used it as the song's chorus, with <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> contributing <b>in.</b> After pitching the song to different artists, including Demi Lovato, she later found out during the Christmas season that Clarkson had recorded it and planned to release the song as the album's lead single.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, an offer's an offer. I don't {{know any}} pleasanter thing than {{getting out of}} this confounded City and smelling the hedges, {{and looking at the}} crops coming up, and passing the Sunday in quiet." [...] And his own tastes being thus agricultural, the honest gentleman thought that <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> must delight <b>in</b> the same recreation.|$|R
