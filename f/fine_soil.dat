25|$|After fairly {{favourable}} {{climatic conditions}} in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters, which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era {{in the summer of}} 1930. During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest, and the entire region south to West Texas lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941. When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains picked up the topsoil and created the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period. The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The <b>fine</b> <b>soil</b> of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{farm type}} in Devon is livestock farming, which includes dairy, lowland cattle, and sheep farms. In 2006, the {{total labour force}} on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by <b>fine</b> <b>soil</b> particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.|$|E

2500|$|Pachypodium {{grows in}} {{various types of}} {{substrate}}s. Some species only grow in one substrate whereas other will grow in several. The {{degree to which a}} taxon can grow in a given substrate seems to determine how specialized its habitat is within the landscape and climates. On outcrops, steep hills, and inselbergs, the plants are subjected to fluctuating moisture, high winds, and temperature extremes. Only plants with special adaptations to exposure and extreme drought can survive, let alone thrive, on these exposed geological habitats. Pachypodium root in cleft, fissures, and crevices of those rocky formations. The non-succulent roots penetrate deeply into the acuminated soil, mineral, and humus in these crevices. Moisture is able to seep deep into these crevices. Very little transpiration occurs. In this manner, rocky substrates provide moisture in the habitat. This saturation of crevices can only occur, however, if there is not a considerable runoff from the rock's surface and if there is abundant <b>fine</b> <b>soil</b> in the cracks that, in turn, retain water. The substrate, therefore, plays a critical role in the creation of micro-environmental [...] "arid islands." ...|$|E

Restrictions are motivated by the poor hydraulic conductivity of <b>fine</b> <b>soils</b> {{that are capable of}} developing of water pressures. However, the use of granular materials can expend the cost of the construction. As a result, local soils, granular or not, have been increasingly used. Unsaturated conditions of <b>fine</b> <b>soils</b> may result in convenient performance even using extensible reinforcements. This paper evaluates the performance of a full scale model of a nonwoven geotextile reinforced wall constructed with <b>fine</b> grained <b>soil</b> backfill. The unsaturated condition was maintained and matric suctions, displacements and reinforcement strains were monitored during the test. Results have shown that the unsaturated condition of the backfill allowed maximum reinforcement peak strain of 0. 4 %. For the case of a wrap faced wall on a firm foundation the performance and good agreement between measured strains and factors of safety from limit equilibrium analyses have shown the maintenance of unsaturated conditions as an economical alternative to the use of high quality fill...|$|R
