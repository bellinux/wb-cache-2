5|$|October, 1963– Hurricane Ginny {{affects the}} {{coastline}} <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> with rough winds, which cause severe beach erosion; the hurricane destroys one house, though overall damage was limited.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on February7 south of Diego Garcia. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> the system remained weak and changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it {{turned to the}} northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady track to the southwest. On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but turned to the southeast and weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Bola {{remained}} near Vanuatu <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> {{during which}} it {{reached its peak}} intensity while executing a cyclonic loop. The most affected locations were Epi island, the Shepherd Islands, and the islands in Malampa Province, and throughout the country the cyclone affected more than 15,000people and 3,000houses. In a five-day period the cyclone dropped about 450mm (17.7in) of rainfall. Two bridges on Malakula were destroyed, and several other bridges were flooded or damaged. The passage of the cyclone also left several buildings, roads, and crop fields damaged.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly's {{first meeting}} {{began with a}} sermon by William Twisse in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 1July 1643. The nave was so full that the House of Commons had to send members ahead to secure seats. Following the sermon, the divines {{processed}} to the Henry VII Chapel, which would be their place of meeting until 2October when they moved to the warmer and more private Jerusalem Chamber. After their initial meeting they adjourned <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> as Parliament had not yet given specific instructions.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E

5000|$|Three days {{every other}} <b>week</b> (two <b>weeks</b> <b>a</b> month), Sheindlin and her {{producers}} tape the court show. They usually produce ten to twelve cases {{for each day}} they tape the show. This makes <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week's</b> worth of episodes, all done within one day. Anywhere from thirty to thirty-six cases are taped over three days during the week. Sheindlin appeared as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 13, 2011. When asked by Kimmel how many days a month she works, Sheindlin replied, [...] "Five days." [...] Sheindlin and her producers sometimes tape only five cases per day and two days per week. The show has fifty-two taping days a year. For each season, some 650 claims are brought to the set to be [...] "presided" [...] over by Judge Judy. This means approximately 8,450 claims {{have been brought to}} Judy Sheindlin's Hollywood set as of the end of its thirteenth season (2008-09).|$|R
50|$|Adults are thelyotokous, females being {{produced}} from unfertilised eggs, and males are rare.

5|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{development}} was heavily {{affected by the}} Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011. The disaster caused public transportation to shut down, preventing Nintendo staff {{from being able to}} commute to work, and the Tokyo office remained closed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Hayashida was inspired by the disaster to encourage his team to communicate more, setting up the office such that staff members could easily see and discuss each other's work. The team also started holding group meetings to play-test 3D Lands levels. Hayashida later mentioned that the team expressed hope that the game would inspire joy in spite of the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, {{a surge of}} moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in {{a short amount of}} time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several inches in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) at the airport in Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E
5|$|A small {{circulation}} formed {{north of}} the Cocos Islands on January8 within the near-equatorial trough. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> it drifted west-southwestward without much development, although an area of convection formed within the system on January11 about 1240km (770mi) southwest of Sumatra. Persistent wind shear prevented much strengthening, and the circulation crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on January16. Another increase in convection merited its classification as a tropical disturbance on the next day, which organized into a central dense overcast. Slow development continued, allowing the disturbance to become a tropical depression and later Tropical Storm Charly on January19. On the same day, the JTWC also began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 06S. Taking a track similar to earlier Tropical Cyclone Bindu, the storm moved southwestward around a ridge to the south. Charly gradually developed outflow and increasingly organized convection due to decreasing wind shear. A ragged eye formed on January20 and became better defined, and early on January21, Charly intensified into a tropical cyclone.|$|E

50|$|Stemming from impressment disturbances, civil-naval {{relations}} deteriorated in Nova Scotia from 1805 to the War of 1812. The HMS Whiting was in Liverpool <b>for</b> only <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> but it terrified {{the small}} town the entire time and naval impressment remained {{a serious threat to}} sailors along the South Shore. After leaving Liverpool, the Whiting terrorized Shelburne by pressing inhabitants, breaking into homes, and forcing more than a dozen families to live in the forest to avoid further harassment.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Scarlet Beach, the Allies set about moving south to secure Finschhafen, which saw {{fighting}} around Jivevaneng also. In mid-October, the Japanese launched a counterattack against the Australian beachhead around Scarlet Beach, which lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{and resulted in}} a small contraction of the Australian lines and a splitting of their force before it was defeated. After this, the Australians regained the initiative and began to pursue the Japanese who withdrew inland towards the high ground around Sattelberg. Amidst heavy fighting and a second failed Japanese counterattack, Sattelberg was secured in late November and the Australians began an area advance to the north to secure a line between Wareo and Gusika. This was completed by early December, and was followed by an advance by Australian forces along the coast through Lakona to Fortification Point, overcoming strong Japanese forces fighting delaying actions.|$|E

5|$|On September25, the {{government}} of Spain approved $1.07million in food assistance for Cuba. On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government {{reported that they had}} allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride {{in a vacuum}}-sealed tube <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material <b>for</b> sustenance. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and <b>a</b> half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|R
