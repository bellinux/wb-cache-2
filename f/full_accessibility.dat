25|$|In March 2003, Transport for London {{managing}} director Peter Hendy advised that accessibility was {{a higher priority}} than retaining conductors, and in August 2003, as the existing contracts became due for renewal, the remaining Routemaster services were replaced, either by low-floor double-decker buses or articulated buses. Government legislation required <b>full</b> <b>accessibility</b> on 22 October 2014 under the Disability Discrimination Act; however, Transport for London was aiming to be compliant far earlier. As a consequence, the last Routemasters were withdrawn from general service on 9 December 2005, although two heritage routes were introduced. This was reduced to one on 25 July 2014.|$|E

50|$|In February 1989 the Fairway was introduced. It {{was fitted}} with a 2,664 cc Nissan TD27 diesel engine. This made the FX4 a faster and more {{reliable}} cab. It had <b>full</b> wheelchair <b>accessibility,</b> in line with a new law that came into force in January 1989. The Fairway was the best version of the FX4 ever built, and enabled LTI to sell to overseas markets, as well as move into provincial UK markets {{they had not been}} able to tackle. Much of this increase in sales was due to local authorities insisting on wheelchair accessible cabs being used in their areas.|$|R
25|$|Bicycle {{traffic on}} Commonwealth Avenue is heavy, and {{advocacy}} groups have held public meetings with BU, the MBTA, and the City of Boston to improve safety and congestion along this travel corridor. The MBTA plans to consolidate {{and reduce the}} number of stops along Commonwealth Avenue to speed travel and to reduce construction costs to upgrade the remaining stations. Improvements planned include <b>full</b> handicapped <b>accessibility</b> at the new stations, fencing to encourage pedestrians to use protected crosswalks, traffic signal prioritization for transit vehicles, and improved esthetics.

50|$|The {{switching}} network {{was composed of}} reed relay cross-points arranged to give three (A, B and C) stages of switching {{on either side of}} a number of linking circuits. The A-stage switches concentrate traffic from the peripheral terminals on to B-C-stage arrays, which are internally connected to provide <b>full</b> <b>accessibility</b> between every B-switch terminal and every C-switch terminal of the array. A simple switch enabling two subscribers to be connected to two others can be constructed, but extending this to larger sizes becomes increasingly uneconomic. Nevertheless, by splitting the network into two stages, considerable economy could be affected.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the quality of the tourist services, 272 establishments are in {{possession}} of the Q award for high quality tourist services, the certificate which represents quality in the Spanish tourism sector. Furthermore, in the Basque Autonomous Community 140 tourist establishments now have the Accessibility Seal which is part of the framework of the Accessibility Programme which has been developed by the Ministry for Industry, Innovation, Trade and Tourism of the Basque Government. This programme advises and prepares tourist establishments to improve their ability to serve customers with physical and intellectual difficulties and visual and hearing impairment. The programme is therefore responsible for showing the establishments how their services can be geared to these customers to offer them a stay with <b>full</b> <b>accessibility</b> which is adapted to their needs. This includes hotels, holiday apartments, tourist offices, interpretation centres, among others.|$|E
50|$|The other mode {{is called}} Free Paint. In Free Paint mode, the player/art trainee is offered {{the ability to}} draw or paint {{anything}} they deem, and can even save their art progress for keeping or {{to be worked on}} later. Unlike Lessons, Free Paint mode allows <b>full</b> <b>accessibility</b> for all the available art tools in Art Academy from the start. The player/art trainee even need not access Lessons mode at all to use Free Paint mode. Like Lessons though, the player/art trainee has three available save slots (independent from Lessons mode) to save their work-in-progress art pieces to be edited later, and can also save their finalized pieces in the Gallery (or the Nintendo DSi Camera Album for DSiWare versions). In Free Paint, the player/art trainee also has access to a designated Image Library implemented in Art Academy. The Image Library includes a categorized selection of 89 photographs which the player/art trainee can use as references and art subjects. However, the pictures in the library cannot be moved or edited in any way. Alternatively, the player/art trainee can also refer to drawings and photographs (additional information below) stored in the Gallery. The Image Library is not available on the original DSiWare versions, but the DSiWare versions can still refer to pictures found in the DSi Camera Album.|$|E

50|$|Gippert is {{the founder}} and leader of the TITUS project (Thesaurus of Indo-European Texts and Languages). Its goal, since its {{foundation}} in 1987, has been the <b>full</b> digital <b>accessibility</b> of textually recorded material of various Indo-European and adjacent languages. In 1999, he started the ARMAZI project (Caucasian Languages and Cultures: Electronic Documentation), which aimed at a comprehensive collection of Caucasian languages material. This project yielded the Georgian National Corpus (GNC). Since 2010, Gippert has been the head of the center “Digital Humanities in the State of Hesse: Integrated Processing and Analysis of Text-based Corpora” within the unit of the “Federal Offensive for the Development of Scientific and Economic Excellence” (LOEWE (project)). This center is a collaboration between the Goethe University of Frankfurt and the Technical University of Darmstadt with additional support from the Goethe Museum Frankfurt.|$|R
40|$|There {{exists a}} dynamic mapping {{relationship}} between the sliding variable and the output variable in a linear, time-invariant (LTI), single-input-single-output (SISO) system. This relationship is invariant of the matched disturbances, which lies in the control space. In this note, a continuous-time dynamic inverse compensator is proposed to reconstruct the sliding variable from the system output. This inverse compensator is stable and causal provided that the original SISO system is minimum phase and that the input-output relative degree is {{less than or equal}} to one. In case the system relative degree is greater than one, a digital approximation for the inverse compensator is introduced to track the sliding variable in discrete-time to the accuracy of O(T), where T is the sampling period. Thus the discrete-time variable structure control (VSC) law can be implemented without <b>full</b> state <b>accessibility...</b>|$|R
