Norell et al., who recognized the embryo as oviraptorid, assigned it to the genus Citipati.

50|$|Although fossilized dinosaur {{eggs are}} rare, Citipati eggs and oviraptorid eggs in general, are {{relatively}} well known. Along {{with the four}} known nesting specimens, dozens of isolated oviraptorid nests have been uncovered in the Gobi Desert. Citipati eggs are shaped like elongated ovals (elongatoolithid) and resemble the eggs of ratites in texture and shell structure. In the nest, Citipati eggs are typically arranged in concentric circles of up to three layers, and a complete clutch may have consisted of as many of 22 eggs. The eggs of Citipati are the largest known definitive oviraptorid eggs, at 18 cm. In contrast, eggs associated with Oviraptor are only up to 14 cm long.Ironically, it was the association with eggs that gave oviraptorids their name (which means 'egg thieves'). The first oviraptorid eggs (of the genus Oviraptor) were found {{in close proximity to}} the remains of the ceratopsian dinosaur Protoceratops and it was assumed that the oviraptorids were preying upon the eggs of the ceratopsians.

Norell et al., who recognized the embryo as oviraptorid, assigned it to the genus Citipati in 2001, based on the vertical orientation of the premaxilla (a bone structure {{at the tip of the}} jaw), a feature found only in Citipati.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the crude ovomucin contents of eggs at various stages of egg formation. The total ovomucin content was greatest in eggs obtained from the isthmus four and one-half hours after oviposition of the previous egg. It was unchanged at six hours, after the egg had entered the shell gland, but declined precipitously {{during the first few}} hours in the shell gland, remaining relatively constant thereafter until oviposition. The rapid decline in ovomucin content of <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> gland corresponded to the period of rapid egg white plumping. Fresh eggs which differed in albumen quality also differed in crude ovomucin content. Hens which were selected for differences in albumen quality of fresh eggs did not differ in the total ovomucin content of eggs obtained from the isthmus. However, the differences in ovomucin content associated with egg quality were apparent in eggs obtained from the shell gland within eight hours after oviposition of the previous egg. Hens fed a diet supplemented with 2 % ammonium chloride in an attempt to increase albumen quality also did not differ in ovomucin content of isthmal eggs. Ovomucin was markedly increased in eggs of this group after oviposition; however, variations in ovomucin content among hens selected for differences in egg quality were not due to differences in the dilution of egg white b...|$|E

50|$|Pasteurizing <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> their <b>shells</b> is {{achieved}} through {{a technique that}} uses precise time and temperature zones within water baths. Pasteurizing <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> their <b>shells</b> can also be achieved through a process that involves treatment with ozone and reactive oxygen species under high and low pressures, followed by replacement with an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Currently, shell eggs pasteurized using the heating technique are the only commercially available pasteurized eggs. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “Shell eggs can be pasteurized by a processor if FDA accepted the process {{for the destruction of}} Salmonella. Pasteurized shell eggs are now available at some grocery stores and must be kept refrigerated to retain quality. The equipment to pasteurize shell eggs isn't widely available for home use, and it may prove difficult to pasteurize shell eggs at home without cooking the contents of the egg.” However, for a growing number of homes with precise sous-vide equipment, pasteurization can easily be achieved by holding eggs at 57C for 75 minutes.|$|R
