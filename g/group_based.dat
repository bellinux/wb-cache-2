50|$|Groups:Lubricant base {{stocks are}} {{categorized}} into five groups by the API. <b>Group</b> I <b>base</b> stocks {{are composed of}} fractionally distilled petroleum which is further refined with solvent extraction processes to improve certain properties such as oxidation resistance and to remove wax. <b>Group</b> II <b>base</b> stocks are composed of fractionally distilled petroleum that has been hydrocracked to further refine and purify it. <b>Group</b> III <b>base</b> stocks have similar characteristics to <b>Group</b> II <b>base</b> stocks, except that <b>Group</b> III <b>base</b> stocks have higher viscosity indexes. <b>Group</b> III <b>base</b> stocks are produced by further hydrocracking of either <b>Group</b> II <b>base</b> stocks or hydroisomerized slack wax (a Group I and II dewaxing process by-product). <b>Group</b> IV <b>base</b> stock are polyalphaolefins (PAOs). Group V is a catch-all <b>group</b> for any <b>base</b> stock not described by Groups I to IV. Examples of <b>group</b> V <b>base</b> stocks include polyolesters (POE), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), and perfluoropolyalkylethers (PFPAEs).

5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a <b>group,</b> <b>based</b> on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
