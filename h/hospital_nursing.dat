25|$|In addition, {{there is}} the {{department}} of nursing, often headed by a chief nursing officer or director of nursing. This department {{is responsible for the}} administration of professional nursing practice, research, and policy for the <b>hospital.</b> <b>Nursing</b> permeates every part of a hospital. Many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty. For example, in an intensive care nursery, the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager/director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of the nurses and nursing care in that unit/ward.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} it was an active {{veterans}} facility, it provided a <b>hospital,</b> <b>nursing</b> care, food, entertainment, and religious services for up to 350 veterans at a time, providing a home for 700 former Confederate soldiers in its years of operations. The requirements to be {{a resident of the}} home was to not only be a former Confederate soldier, but to have been a resident of Kentucky for the past six months, be mentally stable, and to have no problems with alcoholism. Many of the veterans once served under John Hunt Morgan. A fire on March 25, 1920 destroyed the main building, as well as an infirmary ward and laundry. Fortunately, no lives were lost, {{and the rest of the}} facility was enough to house those residents still using the home. Eventually, the number of veterans who could be served dwindled, and by 1934 the hospital was no more, with the remaining five residents being transferred to the nearby Pewee Valley Sanitorium.|$|E
25|$|The International Council Of Nursing (ICN), {{the largest}} {{international}} health professional {{organization in the}} world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, <b>hospital</b> <b>nursing</b> jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes {{is expected to grow}} rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.|$|E

40|$|Study objectives: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> toward demented elderly 	 patients with critical illness and care toward delirium, and to examine caring for the protecting delirium. 	Design: Grounded theory approach. 	Setting: An acute ward in the geriatrics hospital and acute wards including ICU in the general hospital in A city. 	Participants: The study population consisted of 11 nurses working for acute wards in the hospitals. 	Results: Consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> related to delirium of demented geriatric patients with critical illness was 	 discovered in 3 categories and 10 subcategories, and 3 categories were mutually related. In this study, 	 communication formed acceptance process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> were found. The demented elderly patients have 	 increased risks {{for the development of}} delirium and outcomes related to communication and circumstance which is 	 prevalent to ICU. While outcomes suggest that communication and circumstance are not merely risk factors for 	 adjusting for severity of illness, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should notice patients' needs when providing critical care. 	 Additionally, acceptant process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> showed emotional response. 	Conclusions: In this study, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> made therapy prior to any others. Delirium of demented old patients are 	 associated with complications and increased less likelihood of family support after recovery. Caring of critically ill elderly demented patients involved understanding of changing sign or cues. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should focus on how 	 to best care for protecting delirium, not see the illness, but watch on the human who has illness...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} month, Foley {{began an}} angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind {{trying to be}} a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of Raw, while McMahon was in a <b>hospital</b> <b>nursing</b> wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named [...] "Mr. Socko". Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the mandible claw, stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by Jerry [...] "The King" [...] Lawler during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the Hardcore Championship and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and The Rock both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the Sharpshooter, McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the Montreal Screwjob from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially transitioned into a fan favorite, while The Rock became a villain and the crown jewel in McMahon's new Corporation faction.|$|E

60|$|When she was upstairs, {{and once}} more in solitude, she disgraced herself again by crying. She could be strong enough when {{attacked}} by others, but could not be strong when alone. She cried and sobbed upon her bed, and then, rising, looked {{at herself in the}} glass, and told herself that she was old and ugly, and fitted only for that <b>hospital</b> <b>nursing</b> of which she had been thinking. But still there was something about her heart that bore her up. Lady Ball would not have come to her, would not have exercised her eloquence upon her, would not have called upon her to renounce this engagement, had she not found all similar attempts upon her own son to be ineffectual. Could it then be so, that, after all, her cousin would be true to her? If it were so, if it could be so, what would she not do for him and for his children? If it were so, how blessed would have been all these troubles that had brought her to such a haven at last! Then she tried to reconcile his coldness to her with that which she so longed to believe might be the fact. She was not to expect him to be a lover such as are young men. Was she young herself, or would she like him better if he were to assume anything of youth in his manners? She understood that life with him was a serious thing, and that it was his duty to be serious and grave in what he did. It might be that it was essential to his character, after all that had passed, that the question of the property should be settled finally, before he could come to her, and declare his wishes. Thus flattering herself, she put away from her her tears, and dressed herself, smoothing her hair, and washing away the traces of her weeping; and then again she looked at herself in the glass to see if it were possible that she might be comely in his eyes.|$|E
