5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go with her husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna {{took care of her}} mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a character that lives in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E

5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view {{of these}} events was proposed by a British historian, Stephen Christopher Rowell, where he believes that Gediminas never intended to become a Christian himself, since that would have offended the staunchly pagan inhabitants of Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. Both the pagans of Aukštaitija and the Orthodox Rus' threatened Gediminas with death if he decided to convert, where a similar scenario also happened to Mindaugas, which he <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid.|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of Jane developed {{a different way}} to the usual process and there was no regular audition sessions. Aspiring actress Annie Jones spent two months ringing the Neighbours production company asking for a role on the show. She said [...] "I had appeared on several other Australian TV shows, but <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get into Neighbours". Jones originally auditioned for the role of Charlene Mitchell, before she was given the small role, for what was a planned six weeks of appearances. Jones was 19 when she landed the role and became a permanent cast member.|$|E

[...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hang on to what they called freedom.

Her mother, who had been suffering from heart problems, died in November 1897 of a heart attack, and was buried under the name of Fatma Mannoubia. Eberhardt was grief-stricken. Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. When she told him she <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined.|$|E

However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision. For a long time I thought, 'Well, it's {{just not going to}} happen.' Then when I actually started to consider it, it became so clear that I <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say more about these characters, it would've been an easy no and it was a spectacularly easy yes.

500|$|Originally {{the video}} for [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was to be}} {{directed}} by photographer David LaChapelle. He wanted the video to have a [...] "documentary"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, Rize, in which five of the dancers from the [...] "Hung Up" [...] video appeared. LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to Johan Renck, who worked with Madonna in her video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters". According to an interview with MTV, Renck was directing Kate Moss for a H commercial when he {{received a phone call}} from Madonna who <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with him. The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video.

She wore a long, tight, white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls. On her neck she wore $20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston. Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it {{a tribute to the}} actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the mike not appearing from below the ground, and a stage-hand passing it to her. According to Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone, she was quite nervous during the performance; [...] "Had she been singing to an audience of screaming fans, she wouldn't have been at all nervous. But this time she was performing in an auditorium full of established actors and actresses, a group of people to which she really didn't belong, who didn't respect her as an actress but whose respect she <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> win." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s, Kubrick and Harris {{developed}} a sitcom starring Ernie Kovacs and a film adaption {{of the book}} I Stole $16,000,000, but nothing came of them. Tony Frewin, an assistant who worked with the director {{for a long period}} of time, revealed in a March 2013 Atlantic article: [...] "He [...] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a film on the subject." [...] Kubrick had intended making a film about the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name [...] "Dr. Jazz" [...] to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book Swing Under the Nazis after he had finished production on Full Metal Jacket, the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated. The unfinished Aryan Papers, [...] based on Louis Begley's debut novel Wartimes Lies, was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on Aryan Papers depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) covered much of the same material.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be in the big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, you heard the producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut out anyway, I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... Suddenly I came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play and we ended up extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{failed to}} begin {{production}} in January 2008, with sources reporting in March that Linguswamy {{was still working}} on the script. The film was yet to be titled. It was to feature the main crew members of Bheema, including music director Harris Jayaraj, cinematographer R. D. Rajasekhar and editor Anthony. Linguswamy later announced the film with an entirely new crew; Yuvan Shankar Raja replaced Jayaraj as the film's music composer, and Madhi {{was selected as the}} cinematographer, after Rajasekhar had opted out of the project as he was busy working on Jaggubhai. Linguswamy chose Priya Manikandan, wife of cinematographer Manikandan, as the chief costume designer, for whom Paiyaa would be her first film project. Linguswamy further revealed that the film would be produced by his home production studio Thirupathi Brothers and denied that it was a remake of a Telugu film. Lingusamy disclosed later that he had written two scripts, out of which Karthi eventually chose Paiyaa, because he wanted to do an [...] "urban love story" [...] after two successive roles as a ruffian. Initially titled as Kuthirai, it was later renamed as Paiyaa, which was considered a tentative, working title only. Karthi said he was [...] " ... dying to start shooting for Paiyaa [...] " [...] and to [...] " ... wear good clothes ... and he accepted the film because he [...] " ... <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play a cool dude on screen.|$|E
