5000|$|At the {{original}} trial {{the prosecution had}} entered evidence suggesting that Molineux had been responsible for an earlier death, that of Henry Crossman Barnet, {{with the aim of}} showing that he had a propensity to murder. Molineux and Barnet were friends. In November 1897 Molineux had introduced Barnet to Blanche Chesebrough, and shortly after that Blanche turned down Molineux's proposal of marriage. It was alleged that a rivalry which developed between Molineux and Barnet over Blanche was Molineux's motive for bringing about Barnet's death. Barnet died on 10 November 1898, and on 19 November 1898, one week after attending Barnet's funeral, Blanche married Molineux. Barnet's death had been attributed by the attending physicians to a weakened heart caused by diphtheria, {{despite the fact that he}} had become violently ill on 28 October 1898 after having taken a dose from a sample tin of Kutnow's Improved <b>Effervescent</b> <b>Powder</b> which had arrived in the mail, unsolicited, two months earlier. The powder was later analyzed, and found to contain cyanide of mercury. On 28 February 1899 Barnet's body was exhumed and the organs, when analyzed, were found to contain the same poison; however, Molineux had never been indicted for the murder of Barnet, and the Appeals Court ruled that using 'evidence' of an unproven previous act of murder against the defendant in a subsequent unrelated trial violated the basic tenet of presumption of innocence, and, therefore, such evidence was inadmissible (other than on five clearly defined grounds). Thus, [...] "the state cannot prove against a defendant any crime not alleged in the indictment, either as a foundation for a separate punishment, or as aiding the proofs that he is guilty of the crime charged." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the cause of the crystallization in a large volume creatine supplement solution made from <b>effervescent</b> <b>powders</b> containing di-creatine citrate, and to characterize these crystals using thermal analyses and x-ray diffractometry. Creatine <b>effervescent</b> <b>powders</b> were dissolved in deionized water (pH 6. 2) and stored both at room temperature (RT) (25 °C) and refrigerated condition (4 °C) over a period of 45 days. Creatine concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intrinsic dissolution and saturated solubility of creatine, creatine monohydrate, and di-creatine citrate in water were determined and compared. Crystal growth was detected only in the refrigerated samples on the seventh day of storage. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed that the crystals formed were of creatine monohydrate. Ninety percent creatine degradation was observed within 45 days for RT samples. However, at refrigerated condition this degradation was 80 % within the same time period. The pH of the RT samples also increased from 3. 6 to 4. 5 during storage. No such increase was observed in the case of refrigerated samples. The intrinsic dissolution rate constants of the compounds decreased in the following order: dicreatine citrate>creatine>creatine monohydrate. In conclusion, di-creatine citrate used in effervescent formulation dissociates to creatine in aqueous solution and eventually crystallizes out as creatine monohydrate. Significant decrease in solubility and effect of pH contribute to this crystallization process...|$|R

Objective: The aim of the present analysis was to compare the preference for and acceptability, including tolerability, of these 2 formulations based on the Belgian results of the previously mentioned study. Methods: Patients were recruited from 3 osteoporosis units and university hospitals in Brussels, Liege, and Ghent, Belgium. Adult patients at risk for calcium and vitamin D deficiencies were enrolled. The study drugs included 2 formulations of a dietary supplement containing a combination of calcium plus vitamin D- 3 : chewable tablets (calcium carbonate, 1250 mg; vitamin D- 3, 400 IU) (A) and <b>effervescent</b> <b>powder</b> (calcium carbonate, 1250 mg; vitamin D- 3, 440 IU) (B). Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 1 of 2 treatment sequences: AB or BA. Both formulations were given PO BID for 14 days, with a switch to the alternate formulation occurring on day 15 of the study. Preference and acceptability were assessed using 2 questionnaires: one assessed 5 variables of acceptability using 11 -point scales, and the other assessed preference using yes/no questions. Compliance and tolerability were recorded throughout the study, with unused dose counts and recording of adverse events (AEs), respectively. Results: The study comprised 200 patients, 199 of whom received at least 1 dose of study medication and were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (174 women, 25 men; mean age, 66 years [range, 30 - 87 years]).

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, {{we assessed}} the diagnostic capabilities of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in various esophageal pathologic conditions. Thirty-three patients underwent a multidetector CT study after esophageal distention {{by means of}} <b>effervescent</b> <b>powder</b> administered after induction of pharmacologic esophageal hypotonia. All acquired images were post-processed with two- and three-dimensional software tools. The CT data were compared {{with the results of}} conventional radiology (33), endoscopy (28), endoscopy ultrasonography (14), or surgery (14). Follow-up ranged between 4 and 15 months. Esophageal distention in the upper and middle thirds was classified as "good" in 32 of 33 cases (97 %); in the lower third, esophageal distention was "good" in 21 of 33 cases (64 %). Final diagnoses were leiomyoma (six cases), squamous cell carcinoma (six), adenocarcinoma (four), esophageal infiltration by thyroid cancer (two), benign polyposis (two), chronic esophagitis (five), post-sclerotherapy stenosis (one), no abnormalities (seven). When good distention was achieved, the thickness of unaffected esophageal wall was less than 3 mm (range, 1. 5 - 2. 4 mm; mean, 1. 9 mm). Pathologic wall thickening was observed in 25 of 33 cases (76 %), with values ranging between 3. 6 and 36 mm (mean, 9. 6 mm). Spiral CT demonstrated 21 true positive cases, and seven true negative cases. There were four false negative cases and one false positive case. Sensitivity was 84 %, specificity was 87 %, diagnostic accuracy was 85 %, positive predictive value was 95 %, and negative predictive value was 64 %.

40|$|Calcium {{and vitamin}} D supplementation {{has been shown}} to reduce {{secondary}} hyperparathyroidism and {{play a role in the}} management of senile osteoporosis. In order to define the optimal regimen of calcium and vitamin D supplementation to produce the maximal inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion, we have compared the administration of a similar amount of Ca and vitamin D, either as a single morning dose or split in two doses, taken 6 hours apart. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to three investigational procedures, at weekly intervals. After a blank control procedure, when they were not exposed to any drug intake, they received two calcium-vitamin D supplement regimens including either two doses of Orocal D 3 (500 mg Ca and 400 IU vitamin D) 6 hours apart or one water-soluble <b>effervescent</b> <b>powder</b> pack of Cacit D 3 in a single morning dose (1000 mg Ca and 880 IU vitamin D). During the three procedures (control and the two calcium-vitamin D supplementations), venous blood was drawn every 60 minutes for up to 9 hours, for serum Ca and serum PTH measurements. The order of administration of the two Ca and vitamin D supplementation sequences was allocated by randomization. No significant changes in serum Ca were observed during the study. During the 6 hours following Ca and vitamin D supplementation, a statistically significant decrease in serum PTH was observed with both regimens, compared with baseline and with the control procedure. Over this period of time, no differences were observed between the two treatment regimens. However, between the sixth and the ninth hour, serum PTH levels were still significantly decreased compared with baseline with split dose Orocal D 3 administration, while they returned to baseline value with the Cacit D 3 preparation. During this period, the percentage decrease in serum PTH compared with baseline was significantly more pronounced with Orocal D 3 than with Cacit D 3 (P = 0. 0021). We therefore conclude that the administration of two doses of 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D 3 6 hours apart provides a more prolonged decrease in serum PTH levels than the administration of the same total amount of Ca and vitamin D as a single morning dose in young healthy volunteers. This might have implications in terms of protection of the skeleton against secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone resorption and turnover in elderly subjects. Peer reviewe...|$|E
