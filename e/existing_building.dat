40|$|There {{are about}} 42 billion square meters of <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> in China. The energy {{efficiency}} of <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> directly {{relates to the}} energy consumption of the building sector. The retrofit of <b>existing</b> residential <b>building</b> began in the 1990 s in Heilongjiang. The Sino-Canada demonstration project and Sino-France demonstration project of retrofitting <b>existing</b> residential <b>buildings</b> were carried out in 1997 and 2004, respectively. The retrofit method and energy conservation potential of the envelope and heating system of northern <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> are analyzed in this paper, combining the experiences of retrofitting <b>existing</b> residential <b>buildings</b> in Heilongjiang. The software was compiled to aid {{the design of the}} envelope retrofit in Heilongjiang and to analyze the working situation in <b>existing</b> residential <b>building</b> heating systems. The imbalance of the indoor temperature and the quantity of heating loss from opening the window in different retrofit projects are presented. The emphasis on energy efficiency retrofit of the envelope of <b>existing</b> residential <b>buildings</b> should be placed on the wall in northern region. It is possible to reduce about 50 percent of energy consumption of buildings by insulating the wall. The external insulation is suitable for retrofitting <b>existing</b> <b>buildings,</b> and the moisture transfer should be considered at the same time. To insure actual reduction in energy consumption, the heating system should be retrofitted when the envelope is insulated...|$|R

The north aisle, {{together}} with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam roof, was added about 1450. The carved stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.|$|E
5|$|By February 1998, Hertsmere Borough Council granted {{consent for}} Arsenal {{to build a}} {{training}} centre on the greenfield land, adjacent to a local school in the Bell Lane area, London Colney. It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans were referred to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the green belt. Planning permission was obtained in September 1998.|$|E
5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, the Earl of Craven. This was a {{deliberate}} attempt at conserving the <b>existing</b> <b>building,</b> rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E

5|$|The Cow Tower was {{deliberately}} designed to house gunpowder artillery {{when it was}} first built, making it a very rare form of defensive structure for its time: the only equivalents in England are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. The archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham {{go so far as to}} consider the building to be unique within Britain, as God's House was an extension of an <b>existing</b> <b>building,</b> and the West Gate part of the city's walled circuit. The concept of an isolated artillery tower was more common in France, where they were used as temporary and permanent defensive features during the Hundred Years War between the English and the French kings.|$|E

The Board of Regents {{accepted}} the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on its promise, it had to raise more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal transfer of the property was completed. At that time, the institute's property was valued at about $20,000.|$|E

The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks {{probably}} built the original church. The earliest {{part of the building}} is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels {{and by the end of}} the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.|$|E

5|$|In Stevenson's first {{message to}} the legislature, he called on legislators to finally decide whether the state capital would remain at Frankfort or be moved to Lexington or Louisville, as some had wanted. His address {{made it clear that}} he favored keeping the capital at Frankfort, but he noted that {{additional}} space was needed at the present capitol building because the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> could not continue to house enough room both the state treasurer and auditor. He laid out a vision for an addition to the capitol that would make it more spacious and more grandiose. To pay for the expansion, the fiscally conservative Stevenson pressed the federal government to pay claims due Kentucky from Civil War expenses. By the end of his term, the state had collected over $1.5 million in claims. The legislature, however, disregarded his plan for expanding the capitol, instead opting to construct a separate executive office building next to the capitol.|$|E
5|$|Theories vary among {{archaeologists and}} historians {{regarding}} {{who built the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage, and when. One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century. The Culavamsa, an ancient chronicle, mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth relic of the Buddha. Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island, including Rajavaliya and Poojavaliya, which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla. However, according to the studies of Arthur Maurice Hocart, Nissanka Malla only renovated an already <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> and made some additions such as the entrance and outer porch. Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the ancient Mahavamsa, and historian H. W. Codrington both agree with this theory. A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions. In this, he claims that it was built {{by one of his}} generals under his own direction.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the application of}} green practices in <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> from a triple bottom line perspective. It describes {{the most widely used}} benchmark for assessing green practices, the U. S. Green Building Council’s LEED Rating System, and provides a “road map” for pursuing LEED certification. It concludes with a consideration of the triple bottom line, highlighting the economic, environmental, and social benefits of implementing green practices in <b>existing</b> <b>buildings.</b> The broad umbrella of green practices includes a wide range of applications. It encompasses developing high-performance buildings utilizing cutting edge technology to implementing management strategies in <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> that result in improvements to the economic, environmental, and social bottom lines—the triple bottom line. As the built environment of cities is largely old construction and not “green” by design, the benefits of green buildings remain largely untapped. It would not be practical to tear down all <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> and erect in their places high-performance structures. However, that does not mean the advantages of green practices remain outside the grasp of any real estate owner. By taking a broader, triple bottom line approach to managing <b>existing</b> <b>buildings,</b> building owners acknowledge the interconnections between building performance, environmental impacts, and tenant health and well-being. While many benefits of utilizing green practices in <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> are easily identifiable in terms of economic gains, ignoring less tangible benefits such as indoor air quality and thermal comfort creates a barrier in realizing a building’s maximum potential. The U. S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System for <b>Existing</b> <b>Buildings</b> provides a comprehensive approach to building evaluation which incorporates the economic, environmental, and social bottom lines. This paper details how green practices affect the triple bottom line through case studies and an analysis of current literature...|$|R
