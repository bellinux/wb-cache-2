The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

The objective {{of this study is}} to provide estimates of the global and regional incidence and mortality of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by nine pathogens that are commonly transmitted through foods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We abstracted data from systematic reviews and, depending on the overall mortality rates of the country, applied either a national incidence estimate approach or a modified Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) approach to estimate the aetiology-specific incidence and mortality of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases,</b> by age and region.

In this study, the relevance of water handling and hygienic practices on the transmission of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> and soil-transmitted helminthic infections in three communities in Ghana was evaluated. Specifically, the research looked at physico-chemical qualities of household water, the incidence of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> and soil-transmitted helminthic infections. Thirty households were selected by the systematic random sampling technique from the three communities namely Mayera, Ashongman village and Tetegu.

The zones covered urban central, peri-central, north peripheral and south peripheral areas. Overall, 596 households were surveyed by a questionnaire, yielding information on sociodemographic, environmental and hygiene behavioural factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea.; The reported prevalence of diarrhoea among children under the age of five during the 2  weeks preceding the survey was 26 %.

A periurban slum, a village and an urban slum, pins a local control group in Lahore, Pakistan, were investigated. In total, there were 425 infants born from September 1984 to March 1987 in the study. Children were followed from birth to 24 months and anthropometric data were recorded at each examination. A well-designed questionnaire was used to collect background information to identify risk factors for growth faltering over this period. The age at onset of the childhood component was determined individually using the ICP growth model. A late onset was defined as onset after 12 months. Univariate odds ratio analysis identified 20 significant risk factors for a delayed childhood onset in the total sample. Backward logistical analysis showed that only six variables were significant, i. e. small number of rooms in a household, episode(s) of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases,</b> poor house structure, low body mass index, early end of breastfeeding and birth in warm season. Stratified analysis showed that episode(s) of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> and birth in warm season were the only significant risk factors in the two poor areas.
