40|$|This thesis identifies, quantifies {{and models}} water fluxes within the Dauges National Nature Reserve, an acidic valley mire in the French Massif Central. A range of {{techniques}} {{were used to}} investigate the nature and geometry of granite weathering formations and of peat deposits. Rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, stream discharge, stream stage, groundwater table depths and piezometric heads were monitored over a three-year period. The distributed, physics-based hydrological model MIKE SHE / MIKE 11 was used to model water flow within the mire and its catchment. It was shown that the mire is mostly fed by groundwater flowing within the densely <b>fissured</b> <b>granite</b> zone and upwelling through the peat deposits. Upwelling to the peat layer and seepage to overland flow were highest along the mire boundaries. However hydrological functioning differs from this general conceptual model in some locations due to the high variability of the peat hydraulic characteristics, the presence of highly permeable alluvial deposits or past human interference including drainage. The equivalent porous medium approach used to model groundwater flow within the <b>fissured</b> <b>granite</b> zone gave satisfactory results: the model was able to reproduce discharge at several locations within the high-relief catchment and groundwater table depth in most monitoring points. Sensitivity analyses showed that the specific yield and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the fissured zone are the parameters to which simulated stream discharge and groundwater table depth, including in peat, are most sensitive. The model was forced with new vegetation parameters to assess the potential impacts of changes in catchment landuse on the mire hydrological conditions. Replacement of the broadleaf woodlands that currently cover most of the catchment with conifer plantations {{would lead to a}} substantial reduction in surface and groundwater inflows to the mire and to a substantial drop in summer groundwater table depths, particularly along the mire margins...|$|R

40|$|Long-term radiometric and {{hydrological}} investigations at the Wettinquelle mineral spring in Bad Brambach demon-strated {{the existence of}} a fluidal connection to the currently most frequent earthquake-swarm hypocentre at Novy Kostel, 10 km east of Bad Brambach. The gas composition and δ 13 CCH 4 values of this mineral spring were monitored from May 2000 until October 2003, i. e., before, during and after the protracted swarm earthquake period from late August until late December 2000. About eight weeks after the beginning of the seismically active period, we observed an increase in the methane concentration (from ≈ 40 up to ≈ 250 ppmv) accompanied by a decrease in the methane δ 13 C values from ≈– 50 to ≈– 70 ‰. For more than two years, such periods of variations were repeatedly observed before returning to the “baseline” signature. It is assumed that this additional methane was microbially produced in the granite-enclosed aquifer using H 2, which was released (seismically triggered) from the <b>fissured</b> <b>granite</b> in which the Wettinquelle spring capture is located. The additional methane production might have started as a co-seismic event, with only the migration from the deep granite to the surface being responsible for the eight-week delay...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{evaluation}} {{of the importance of}} the thermo-hydro-mechanical couplings (THM) on the performance assessment of a deep underground storage design has been made as part of the international DECOVALEX III project. It is a numerical study that simulates a generic repository configuration in the near field in a <b>granite</b> <b>medium.</b> The thermo-hydro-mechanical evolution of the whole configuration is simulated over a period of 100 years. The model used to represent the unsaturated behaviour of the various porous media makes allowance for moisture transfers through the effect of thermal and water gradients. The paper presents a comparison of the temperature, water pressure and stress fields obtained by TM, TH, HM and THM coupled calculations. The results demonstrate that temperature is hardly affected by the couplings. In contrast the influence of the couplings on the mechanical stresses is considerable. This is attributed to the key role that water has on bentonite swelling or shrinkage effects that are dependent on its saturation level variations. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the face}} of {{increasing}} demands for irrigated agriculture, many states in India are facing water scarcity issues,leading to severe groundwater depletion. Because perennial water resources in southern India consist mainly ofcrystalline aquifers, understanding how recharge takes place {{and the role of}} preferential flow zones in such het-erogeneous media is of prime importance for successful and sustainable aquifer management. Here we investigatehow vertical heterogeneities and highly transmissive sub-horizontal discontinuities may control groundwater flowsand recharge dynamics. Recharge processes in the vadose zone were examined by analysing the propagation ofan infiltration front and mass transfers resulting from the implementation of a managed aquifer recharge (MAR) structure. Said structure was set up in the Experimental Hydrogeological Park in Telangana (Southern India), awell-equipped and continuously monitored site, which is periodically supplied with surface water deviated fromthe nearby Musi river, downstream of Hyderabad. An initial volume balance equation was applied to quantify the overall inputs from the MAR structure intothe groundwater system, which was confirmed using a chloride mass balance approach. To understand how thisincoming mass is then distributed within the aquifer, we monitored the evolution of water volumes in the tank, andthe resulting lateral propagation front observed in the surrounding borehole network. Borehole logs of temperatureand conductivity were regularly performed to identify preferential flow paths. As a result we observed that masstransfers take place in the way of preferential lateral flow through the most transmissive zones of the profile. These include the interface between the lower portion of the upper weathered horizon (the saprolite) and theupper part of the underlying <b>fissured</b> <b>granite,</b> as well as the first flowing fractures. This leads to a rapid lateraltransfer of recharge, which allows quick replenishment of aquifers but may have severe implications regardinggroundwater quality, whether contaminants originate from diffuse sources (such as fertilizers), or a localizedinjection of polluted surface water. These findings confirm previous studies about the non-linear behaviour ofhard rock aquifers (Guihéneuf et al., 2014) and recharge processes (Boisson et al., 2015; Alazard et al., 2015). Depending on water level conditions, the aquifer shifts from a regional flow system (when superficial moreconnected and weathered levels are saturated), to independent local flow systems (when only the lower lesserfractured portion is saturated). Thus recharge seems to be controlled by the existence of (i) vertical heterogeneitieswithin the unsaturated zone and (ii) highly transmissive sub-horizontal discontinuities, both of which controllinggroundwater flows and recharge dynamics...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} in remediating cracks and fissures in concrete by utilizing microbiologically induced calcite (CaCo 3) precipitation is discussed. Microbiologically induced calcite precipitation (MICP) {{is a technique}} that comes under a broader category of science called biomineralization. It is a process by which living organisms form inorganic solids. Bacillus Pasteruii, a common soil bacterium can induce the precipitation of calcite. As a microbial sealant, CaCO 3 exhibited its positive potential in selectively consolidating simulated fractures and surface <b>fissures</b> in <b>granites</b> and in the consolidation of sand. MICP is highly desirable because the calcite precipitation induced {{as a result of}} microbial activities, is pollution free and natural. The technique can be used to improve the compressive strength and stiffness of cracked concrete specimens. A durability study on concrete beams treated with bacteria, exposed to alkaline, sulfate and freeze-thaw environments were also studied. The effect of different concentrations of bacteria on the durability of concrete was also studied. It was found that all the beams with bacteria performed better than the control beams (without bacteria). The durability performance increased with increase in the concentration of bacteria. Microbial calcite precipitation was quantified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and visualized by SEM. The unique imaging and microanalysis capabilities of SEM established the presence of calcite precipitation inside cracks, bacterial impressions and a new calcite layer on the surface of concrete. This calcite layer improves the impermeability of the specimen, thus increasing its resistance to alkaline, sulfate and freeze-thaw attack. ...|$|R

The grain size of 45 blast-holes drill cuttings collected from three selected while drilling of these rocks were determined using standard method of America Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 2487. The brittleness values are 50 %, 44 % and 42 % for micro granite, porphyritic <b>granite</b> and <b>medium</b> biotite <b>granite</b> respectively. The result of BI varied from 10. 32 – 11. 59 and they are rated as moderately brittle rocks.

Electrical resistivity response of quartz reef intrusive in granite host rock has been studied using synthetic simulation for different physical conditions such as: (1) fresh intrusive body with no alteration at contacts, (2) fresh intrusive body with weathered-fissured contacts, and (3) also fissured intrusive body with weathered-fissured contacts. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was carried out traversing across and along the quartz reef at Kothur village, Hyderabad, India. Based on the ERT results 11 bore wells have been drilled followed by yield measurement. litholog collection, and electrical resistivity logging. Geomorphology, ERT images, lithologs, resistivity logs and yield of the wells are found corroborating with each other.

In the amphibolite-granulite facies transition zone the granite is intimately mixed with migmatites and charnockite. Field observations suggests that anatexis of Peninsular gneisses {{led to the formation}} of granite melt, and there is a space relationship between migmatite formation, charnockite development and production and emplacement of granite magma.

One of the two sites also comprises a metre-wide dolerite dyke. Weathering processes appear to be at the origin of fissures development and of a related enhanced local hydraulic conductivity, both in the quartz reef and in the surrounding granite. The weathering profile in the <b>granite</b> (saprolite and <b>fissured</b> layer) is characterized by an abrupt deepening of the weathered layers in the granite near the contact and in the quartz reef itself. Therefore, the weathering profile shows a 'U'-shape geometry with, among others, the verticalization of the <b>granite's</b> <b>fissured</b> layer. The hydraulic conductivity of this verticalized layer is on average 5 x 10 - 6 m/s and storativity about 10 - 3 (-). The hydraulic conductivity of the fissured quartz is 4 to 6 x 10 - 6 m/s and its storativity about 3 to 5 x 10 - 4 (-). Both media are also characterized by a matrix hydraulic conductivity (10 - 7 to 10 - 9 m/s) and by a significant heterogeneity in hydrodynamic properties that generates preferential flow paths along the sub-vertical fissures parallel to the reef axis. A special attention has been paid for characterizing this heterogeneity. The weathering of the dolerite dyke, however, results in a local low hydraulic conductivity, which consequently does not enhance either the thickness of weathered granite layers or its hydraulic conductivity. The obtained results complete the conceptual hydrogeological model developed for weathered granite aquifers in characterizing the relationships between weathering processes and hydrodynamic properties near geological discontinuities...|$|R
6000|$|... 273. The {{causes of}} the {{different}} effects of air on stone must be numerous, and the investigation of them excessively difficult. With regard, first, to rocks en masse, if their structure be crystalline, or their composition argillaceous, {{the effect of the}} air will, I think, ordinarily, be found injurious. Thus, in granite, which has a kind of parallelogrammatic cleavage, water introduces itself into the fissures, and the result, in a sharp frost, will be a disintegration of the rocks en masse; and, if the felspar be predominant in the composition of the granite, it will be subject to a rapid decomposition. The morvine of some of the Chamouni and Allée Blanche glaciers is composed of a white granite, being chiefly composed of quartz and felspar, with a little chlorite. The sand and gravel at the edge of these glaciers appears far more the result of decomposition than attrition. All finely foliated rocks, slates, etc., are liable to injury from frost or wet weather. The road of the Simplon, on the Italian side, is in some parts dangerous in, or after, wet weather, on account of the rocks of slate continually falling from the overhanging mountains above; this, however, is mere disintegration, not decomposition. Not so with the breccias of Central Switzerland. The rock of Righi is composed of pebbles of different kinds, joined by a red argillaceous gluten. When this rock has not been exposed to the air, it is very hard: you may almost as easily break the pebbles as detach them from their matrix; but, when exposed for a few years to wind and weather, the matrix becomes soft, and the pebbles may be easily detached. I was struck with the difference between this rock and a breccia at Epinal, in France, where the matrix was a red sandstone, like that of the cathedral at Basle. Here, though the rock had every appearance of having been long exposed to the air, it was as hard as iron; and it was utterly impossible to detach any of the pebbles from the bed: it was difficult even to break the rock at all. I cannot positively state that the gluten in these sandstones is calcareous, but I suppose it to have been so. Compact calcareous rock, as far as I remember, appears to be subject to no injury from the weather. Many churches in Italy, and almost the whole cities of Venice and Genoa, are built of very fine marble; and the perfection of the delicate carvings, however aged, is most remarkable. I remember a church, near Pavia, coated with the finest and most expensive marbles; a range of beautifully sculptured medallions running round its base, though old, were as distinct and fine in their execution as if they had just come out of the sculptor's studio. If, therefore, the gluten of the sandstone be either calcareous or siliceous, it will naturally produce the effect above alluded to, though it is certainly singular that the stone should be soft when first quarried. Sandstone is a rock in which you seldom see many cracks or fissures in the strata: they are generally continuous and solid. Now, there may be a certain degree of density in the mass, which could not be increased without producing, as in <b>granite,</b> <b>fissures</b> running through it: the particles may be supposed to be held in a certain degree of tension, and there may be a tendency to what the French call assaissement (I do not know the English term), which is, nevertheless, resisted by the stone en masse; and a quantity of water may likewise be held, not in a state of chemical combination, but in one of close mixture with the rock. On being broken or quarried, the assaissement may take place, the particles of stone may draw closer together, the attraction become stronger; and, on the exposure to the air, the water, however intimately combined, will, in a process of years, be driven off, occasioning the consolidation of the calcareous, and the near approach of the siliceous, particles, and a consequent gradual induration of the whole body of the stone. I offer this supposition with all diffidence; there may be many other causes, which cannot be developed until proper experiments have been made. It would be interesting to ascertain the relative hardness of different specimens of sandstone, taken from different depths in a bed, the surface of which was exposed to the air, as of specimens exposed to the air for different lengths of time.|$|R

Geologically, this region is {{included}} at the northern Mantiqueira structural province and Atlantic shear belt. It is formed by the gneiss of Early Proterozoic age, representing the regional basement, and by supracrustals sequences (micaschists of Rio Doce group and quartzites of Crenaque group) considered of Neoproterozoic age. Two deformational phases and a medium grade metamorphism (low amphibolite facies) affected the region during the Brasiliano cycle. The D 1 phase is the main deformational phase of the region and it is associated to movements with an important dextral strike-slip shear. This phase is followed lately by D 2 phase, characterized by extensional movements. We can observe two granitoid suites in this region: the Galiléia and the Urucum suites. The ascension and emplacement of these rocks are associated to the regional deformational phase D 1. Within the Urucum suite leucogranites, this phase conditioned the trajectories of the magmatic flux foliation and lineation. Despite the lack of structural data in others regions of the Galiléia suite batholite, the obtained data in the studied region show the importance of the D 1 deformational phase during the Galiléia batholite evolution. The Galiléia suite granitoids (594 ± 6 Ma, zircon U-Pb age) are made of tonalites, granodiorites, granites and micro granites. These rocks frequently include magmatic enclaves. These granitoids are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous. They show calc-alcaline affinity and they were formed under 10 kbar (30 - 35 km) and 850 °C to 700 °C. The mineralogical and geochemical data indicate an evolution from tonalite to microgranite. The Ti, Mg, Al, Fe, Ca, Mn, P, Co, Sc, V, Zn and Ni had a compatible behaviour. In the other way, Si, Na and K were incompatibles elements during the mainly evolutive history of these rocks. The mechanical mixing (mingling) and chemical reequilibrages processes observed between the enclaves and their host rocks, and the presence of two zircon populations show the hybrid character of this suite. Isotopic Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd studies indicates an origin from crustal melting rocks (lower crust) for the granitoids and their enclaves and confirm the reequilibrage between enclaves and host rocks. The Urucum suite leucogranites (582 ± 2 Ma; zircon V-Pb age) are represented by potassic megafeldspar <b>granites</b> (Urucum facies), <b>medium</b> to coarse deformed granites (palmital facies), tourmaline granites and pegmatite granites. These rocks are peraluminous and their composition nears the S type granites. They crystallized about 750 - 600 °C and 4 kbar (12 km), within a fluid rich environment. The mineralogical and chemical studies suggest an evolution from the Urucum facies to the pegmatite granites and the compatible comportment of Mg, Ti, Fe, Ba, Zr, Th, Co, V, Zn, Ga, Ni, Cr and rare earth elements. The origin of this suite from the fusion of crustal rocks is confirmed by the isotopic Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd studies, by the zircon composition and typology and by the presence of inherited zircon nucleus. Field observations together with mineralogical and chemical studies show a close relationship between the Urucum suite leucogranite and the rare element pegmatites of the region. The observed pegmatite geometry and kinematics indicate an emplacement controlled by the D 1 deformational phase. The magmas that originated the pegmatites are fluid rich (bore). The pegmatites were emplaced about 540 °C and 3. 2 kbar. Our data favored a genetic and emplacement model supporting a mantle and a crusted melting in a tranpressional tectonic regime associated {{with the end of the}} Brasiliano cycle during the Neoproterozoic. Our geochronological data added to others granitoids ones in the Atlantic shear belt indicate that the calc-alcalin magmatism occurred between 620 and 588 Ma and that the collisional crustal peraluminous magmatism occurred between 584 and 570 Ma. The Sm-Nd model ages of the Galiléia and Urucum suites are concentrated between 2300 and 1800 Ma indicating the important volume of the crust formed during the Transamazônico cycle in the genese of these suites. La région de Conselheiro Pena et Galileia est située dans l'est de l'état de Minas Gerais (sud-est du Brésil). Elle fait partie du nord de la ceinture de cisaillement atlantique et est formée par des gneiss d'âge protérozoique inférieur et par des séquences supracrustales considérées d'âge néoprotérozoique. Deux phases de déformation et un métamorphisme de moyen degré ont affecté la région pendant le cycle Brasiliano. La phase D 1 s'associe à des mouvements décrochants dextres. Cette phase a été suivie tardivement par la phase D 2, caracterisée par une phase d'extension. La suite Galileia et la suite Urucum ont une ascension et mise en place associées à la déformation D 1. Les granitoïdes de la suite Galileia (594 ± 6 Ma) sont constitués par des tonalités, tonalogranodiorites, granodiorites, granites et microgranites. Dans l'ensemble, ces granitoïdes sont métalumineux à peralumineux avec une affinité calco-alcaline. Ils ont eu une origine sous des pressions d'environ 10 kbars et des températures entre 850 °C et 700 °C. L'étude isotopique indique une origine à partir de la fusion de roches crustales. Les leucogranites de la suite Urucum (582 ± 2 Ma) sont représentés par des granites peralumineux. Elles ont été cristallisées entre 750 °C et 600 °C et sous des pressions de l'ordre de 4 KBars dans un environnement riche en fluides. L'origine de cette suite à partir de la fusion de roches crustales est indiquée par les études isotopiques, par la composition et typologie des zircons et aussi par la présence commune de curs de zircons hérités. Les observations de terrain et les études minéralogiques et géochimiques montrent qu'il existe une relation étroite entre les leucogranites de la suite Urucum et les pegmatites à éléments rares de la région. Nous pouvons envisager un modèle de genèse évoquant une fusion du manteau et, en suite, de la croûte due à l'épaississement des marges continentales sous un régime tectonique transpressional associé à la fin du cycle Brasiliano...|$|R
