5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E
5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., a mapping f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E

Using this it <b>is</b> proved <b>that</b> <b>each</b> plane arc-smooth continuum is a retract of the hyperspace of its closed sub-sets.

25|$|Unlike most genes, {{which have}} a stable {{sequence}} in each cell which expresses them, the T cell receptor {{is made up of}} a series of alternative gene fragments. In order to create a functional T cell receptor, the double negative thymocytes use a series of DNA-interacting enzymes to clip the DNA and bring separate gene fragments together. The outcome of this process <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> T cell receptor has a different sequence, due to different choice of gene fragments and the errors introduced during the cutting and joining process (see section on V(D)J recombination for more information on TCR rearrangement). The evolutionary advantage in having a large number of unique T cell receptors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> T cell is capable of recognizing a different peptide, providing a defense against rapidly evolving pathogens.|$|E
25|$|When writing Finnish, the {{foundational}} principle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> letter stands for one sound and each sound is always {{represented by the}} same letter, {{within the bounds of}} a single morpheme.

50|$|The foundation's first {{requirement}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> chapel include religious (predominantly Christian) images, such as Heinrich Hoffman's Christ in the Garden.

Most of the Christian iconography in the chapels has been removed to ensure <b>that</b> the spaces <b>are</b> not religiously specific and to welcome groups of other faiths to use the chapel spaces.|$|R

25|$|In magnetostatics, {{the force}} of {{attraction}} or repulsion between two current-carrying wires (see first figure below) is often called Ampère's force law.

25|$|A {{binary tree}} {{can be seen}} as a type of linked list where the {{elements}} are themselves linked lists of the same nature.

25|$|A lyric {{sequence}} {{is a collection}} of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.|$|E

25|$|For fungi, {{anastomosis}} is also {{a component}} of reproduction. In some fungi, two different haploid mating types – if compatible – merge. Somatically, they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> septated unit is binucleate, containing two unfused nuclei, i.e., one from each parent that eventually undergoes karyogamy and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{theatrical}} devices in Angels <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> of the eight main actors has one or several other minor roles in the play. For example, the actor playing the nurse, Emily, also plays the Angel, Sister Ella Chapter (a real estate agent), and a homeless woman. This doubling and tripling of roles encourages the audience to consider the elasticity of, for example, gender and sexual identities.|$|E
25|$|The reason Danish, Swedish {{and the two}} {{official}} written {{versions of}} Norwegian (Nynorsk and Bokmål) are traditionally viewed as different languages, rather than dialects of one common language, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>each</b> is a well-established standard language in its respective country. Danish, Swedish and Norwegian have, since medieval times, been influenced to varying degrees by Middle Low German and standard German. A substantial amount of that influence was a by-product of the economic activity generated by the Hanseatic League.|$|E
