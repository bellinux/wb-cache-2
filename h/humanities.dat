40|$|This paper {{purports to}} explore the nature of crimes against <b>humanity</b> as a unique family of crimes and how the concept of crimes against <b>humanity</b> embodies the spirit of our time. It argues that what makes crimes against <b>humanity</b> {{profound}} crimes {{is the fact that}} they are crimes against the metaphysical and practical identity of all human beings; they injure <b>humanity</b> as the intersubjectivity of all human beings. Doing so, it will first demonstrate how the concept of crimes against <b>humanity</b> bears out the truth that the norm of <b>humanity</b> is a legal norm; <b>humanity</b> is a possible object of legal injury and a legitimate subject to which action is held accountable for. It then examines the four basic features of crimes against <b>humanity,</b> indicating that a crime against <b>humanity</b> is a global crime that is motivated to injure <b>humanity,</b> policy-laden, and systematic. Finally, it further discusses the nature and precepts of the laws of <b>humanity</b> in virtue of which crimes against <b>humanity</b> are defined as so and so...|$|R
