40|$|The work {{reported}} is a deliverable {{within the}} framework of the Administrative Arrangement between DG ENTR and JRC on support to the implementation, harmonization and further development of the <b>Eurocodes.</b> The document addresses the need to coordinate the activities on the international promotion of the <b>Eurocodes</b> at the Community level and proposes a strategy and an initial programme for their coordinated promotion in third countries. The goals and interests of the stakeholders in the international promotion of the <b>Eurocodes</b> are analysed. Their convergence naturally calls for the setting up of a framework for coordinated promotion of the <b>Eurocodes</b> in third countries. The coordinated actions will provide considerable benefits to the stakeholders through: 	Putting into operation common implementation strategy, tools and resources, 	Organizing joint missions involving more than one stakeholder, and 	Making the most effective use of the co-financing instruments available at the Community level. A methodology for promotion of the <b>Eurocodes</b> in third countries is proposed, which aims at a better use of the resources available and tailored the promotion actions according to the needs of the individual countries. The methodology encompasses: 	The approach and the tools necessary for coordinated international promotion, 	The identification of target groups within a country, 	The involvement of organisations/individuals interested in the international promotion.

Selected activities which are focused on the progress and specific needs for adoption and implementation of the <b>Eurocodes</b> and related EN standards in the Balkan region (Apostolska et al., 2013) are presented in the paper. These activities are carried out {{within the framework of the}} JRC Enlargement and Integration Action and intend to foster the implementation of the <b>Eurocodes</b> in the Balkan region. They encompass: (1) mapping of the current situation in the adoption and implementation of the <b>Eurocodes</b> in the Balkan region which was carried out by means of a questionnaire sent to the relevant national stakeholders and (2) a Workshop which brought together national experts and nominated experts from the European Commission, EU Member States and CEN/TC 250. Generally, it may be concluded that most of the countries in the Balkan region are going to use the <b>Eurocodes</b> as primary standards. These countries are aware about needs for harmonization of national legislation and standardization framework for construction with EU legislation. However, in most of the countries there is a lack of relevant institutional support for adoption and implementation of the <b>Eurocodes.</b> One of the main recommendations streaming from the activities carried out is to increase exchange of experience and strengthen regional cooperation for elaboration of National Annexes and cross-border harmonization of the NDPs, especially in the elaboration of seismic hazard maps.
