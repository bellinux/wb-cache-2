40|$|A set of {{exploratory}} {{experiments are}} conducted {{to test a}} newly designed strut for fuel injection and flame holding in a liquid-kerosene-fueled dual-mode scramjet combustor. The thickness of the strut is 8 mm and the front blockage is about 8 %. To organize stable combustion in a Mach number equal to 2. 6 air flow under this thin strut using room-temperature liquid kerosene in a <b>flash</b> <b>wall</b> combustor without any cavity and other flame holders, some oxygen is injected {{through a set of}} orifices {{at the back of the}} strut, based on which a stable center local flame is generated at the back of the strut and the main flow combustion can be organized around this local flame. Experimental results show that stable combustion can be achieved at the center of the combustor with a wide range of equivalence ratio from 0. 19 to 1 based on this center flame strut strategy. Through the analysis of the pressure distribution along the combustor, different combustor modes appear with different equivalence ratio. The article also gives some discussions about different influence of the oxygen to the combustion process under different equivalence ratio...|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{question}} which, {{in spite of the}} claims of Painting to be called the Sister of Poetry, appears to me to admit of considerable doubt, whether art has ever, except in its earliest and rudest stages, possessed anything like efficient moral influence on mankind.

The EPI 2 ̆ 7 s unabashed emphasis on marketing, packaging, consumer goods, and empty celebrity are all manifestations of fears of late capitalist excess, but beneath the veneer of vapidity was an undercurrent of counterculture political activism and social awareness.

40|$|The {{position}} of a flash presented during pursuit is mislocalized {{in the direction of}} the pursuit. Although this has been explained by a temporal mismatch between the slow visual processing of flash and fast efferent signals on eye positions, here we show that spatial contexts also play an important role in determining the flash position. We put various continuously lit objects (walls) between veridical and to-be-mislocalized positions of <b>flash.</b> Consequently, these <b>walls</b> significantly reduced the mislocalization of flash, preventing the flash from being mislocalized beyond the wall (Experiment 1). When the wall was shortened or had a hole in its center, the shape of the mislocalized flash was vertically shortened as if cutoff or funneled by the wall (Experiment 2). The wall also induced color interactions; a red wall made a green flash appear yellowish if it was in the path of mislocalization (Experiment 3). Finally, those flash–wall interactions could be induced even when the walls were presented after the disappearance of flash (Experiment 4). These results indicate that various features (position, shape, and color) of flash during pursuit are determined with an integration window that is spatially and temporally broad, providing a new insight for generating mechanisms of eye-movement mislocalizations...|$|R
