40|$|Background: <b>Food</b> iron <b>fortification</b> {{can be a}} good {{strategy}} to prevent iron deficiency. Iron bioavailability from cocoa powder enriched with ferric pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes or ferrous fumarate was assessed in rats. Methods: Three groups of rats consumed during 28 days either a control diet or two diets prepared with ferric pyrophosphate- or ferrous fumarate-enriched cocoa powder as the unique source of iron. Body weight and food intake were monitored and last-week feces were collected. On day 28, animals were sacrificed and livers and spleens were removed. Hemoglobin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were determined. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} body weight and food intake. Apparent iron absorption and % absorption/intake were significantly lower in rats consuming enriched cocoa compared to the control group, without significant differences due to the iron form. Enriched cocoa groups showed significantly lower spleen iron content and concentration than the control. Liver iron was lower in the ferric pyrophosphate group compared to the other two groups. Hemoglobin and TIBC values showed a deficient iron status in ferric pyrophosphate rats. Conclusion: Cocoa powder is a good vehicle for iron fortification when enriched with ferrous fumarate compared to ferric pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.

The more bioavailable forms of iron, such as ferrous gluconate, cause adverse organoleptic changes when added to foods. The primary aim of the work described in this thesis was to test whether alginate would bind soluble forms of iron and thereby maintain its bioavailability. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated that alginate solutions and beads loaded with ferrous gluconate delivered iron in an available form for uptake into Caco- 2 cells (measured by ferritin formation). A human study was undertaken to assess the bioavailability of ferrous gluconate in alginate beads, and it was found to be significantly lower than ferrous gluconate on its own, so further in vitro studies were undertaken to examine possible reasons for the inhibitory effect of the beads. It was concluded that alginate beads, containing calcium as a gelling agent, are not an effective delivery vehicle for soluble iron compounds. However, these findings should not rule out the potential use of alginates as a delivery system for iron, especially in diets containing high levels of phytate. Other related work reported in this thesis includes studies of iron availability from two wheat cultivars with varying phytate and iron concentrations, potential use of nicotianamine and 2 '- deoxymugineic acid as iron enhancers, and investigations into calcium-iron interactions in a Caco- 2 cell model, with the use of live cell imaging techniques and confocal microscopy...|$|R
