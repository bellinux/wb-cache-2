5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} mockup was formally reviewed in March 1949. The prototype {{was completed by}} August 1949, but an incident involving the rival swept-wing Tupolev Tu-82 that broke an <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> during a low-altitude flight led to delays as additional tests were demanded to determine {{the strength of the}} wings before the first flight was made. By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate its resources on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28. It was formally terminated by government order on 20 August 1950, and the prototype was eventually scrapped {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. Aviation historian Bill Gunston quotes a maiden flight date of 9 September 1949, but Vaclav Nemecek says 1951.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} components in a vehicle to isolate noise and vibration generated by the engine from the driver and passenger. There are three main types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> such as passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> semi-active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The price of the mounting in the market range from the cheapest which is passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the most expensive type of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vary with the price of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> with the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the low quality isolation of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the highest quality isolation of NVH. In order to reduce the vibrations, noise and harshness (NVH) level for vehicles, understanding about the vibration characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in detail is crucial. The objective of this project is to analyze the vibration cause by the engine of a Perodua Kenari on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system at different engine revolutions per minute (rpm). The experiment is carried out on a stationary vehicle using DasyLab software. Here, analysis on the vibration obtained from the experiment carried out helps to determine the time response and frequency response of the engine at different rpm. From the results obtained, we can understand the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the fundamental of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> among the three types. By understanding the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> improvement can be made on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in a low cost method to further improve on the NVH isolation qualit...|$|R

25|$|The 2.5 TL was {{positioned}} as the sporty {{model and the}} 3.2 focused more upon a luxurious ride. There were minimal styling differences between the two, but the 3.2 TL had larger tires despite the 2.5 TL's more sporty marketing. Moreover, the added power in the 3.2 TL gave it better acceleration. The V6 engine in the 3.2 TL was mounted in a front-rear, or longitudinal position. This contrasted with the more typical transverse <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> style, and was intended to provide better weight distribution and reduce nose dive. The <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> design resulted in an elongated hood for the first generation TL. The inline-5 engine in the 2.5 TL competed with similar 5-cylinder engines offered in Audi and Volvo models.|$|E

40|$|The vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system, which {{consists}} of several <b>mounts</b> connecting the <b>engine</b> to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system is referred to a mounting system where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric mounting system. The developed computational model of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional mounting system for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic mounting system and compared to the results from the conventional <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for vibration isolation improvement in heavy trucks by using adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems...|$|R

25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a reclined pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder twist grips which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge.|$|E

25|$|Weight-saving was a {{priority}} across the aircraft; the airframe, {{other than the}} steel tube <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> and cowling, featured a wooden rectangular monocoque structure. It had a glued plywood skin, fixed to the mahogany longerons and struts forming the internal structure, which was faired throughout {{to result in a}} low-drag extensions. A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E
25|$|The Sorrell family {{originated}} {{from the state}} of Oregon, which was the last state to ban homebuilt aircraft. Hobie Sorrell petitioned congress for experimental aircraft regulations, and his son Tim designed the Hiperbipe in a series of family designed homebuilt aircraft. The design is of mixed construction. The fuselage, tail, <b>engine</b> <b>mount,</b> landing gear mounts, interplane struts and flight controls are all built from welded 4130 steel. The wings are made from wood, with wooden stressed skin. The landing gear is sprung steel tube. The engine cowling and wheel pants are fibreglass. The whole airframe is covered in doped aircraft fabric, including the plywood-covered wings. The airfoil is a custom symmetrical design.|$|E
25|$|The Beaver {{family of}} {{aircraft}} all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 aluminum tube {{that supports the}} tail, landing gear and seats. The wings and <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> are similarly of 6061-T6 aluminum tube and attached to the main tube by connecting struts. The wing features aluminum tube spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits {{in as little as}} 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory-claimed build times 150–200 hours for the SS and 180–200 hours to the RX 550 Plus.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{computational}} models for commercial vehicle engine vibration dynamics are presented. The first model is conventional elastomeric <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour {{of the dynamic}} stiffness and damping of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric <b>mounts</b> making the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system an adaptronic one. Parameter optimization of the proposed adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system has been done. Computational models are implemented in Matlab /Simulink with GUI suitable for engine vibration dynamics analysis under different engine excitations and realistic road inputs. Simulations of engine vibration and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure are presented which are obtained by using both computational models for the same inputs of engine and road excitations. Comparison of the obtained results for adaptronic mounting system (AMS) to the corresponding results of conventional mounting system (CMS) demonstrates up to % 24 reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} transmitted force to the vehicle structure achieved with adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system that includes two actuators with forces not exceeding 50 (N) ...|$|R

Moriya of the Koku Shinsa-bu (Air Examination Department) with 2nd Lt. Ikebayashi in the second seat. Unfortunately, the pilot undershot the runway and touched down in soft soil, ground-looping the aircraft and tearing off the port undercarriage leg and <b>engine</b> <b>mount,</b> also bending the six-blade propeller.

25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E
500|$|The first XBTM-1 {{made its}} maiden flight on 26 August 1944 and began flight testing after {{it reached the}} Naval Air Test Center (NATC) on 11 December. The Navy ordered 750 more {{aircraft}} on 15 January 1945, although this was reduced to 99 aircraft after the surrender of Japan in August. The second prototype made its first flight on 20 May. Initial flight tests conducted with the first two prototypes revealed significant problems with the engine, its cowling, the vertical stabilizer and rudder. In response, the cowling was lengthened [...] and the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> was canted two degrees {{to the right to}} offset the engine's tremendous torque. The length of the carburetor airscoop was extended and the propeller spinner, rudder, and the vertical stabilizer were redesigned. In April 1946 the aircraft designation was changed to AM-1 when the Navy replaced its Bomber-Torpedo classification with Attack, well before the redesign was completed in early 1947.|$|E
