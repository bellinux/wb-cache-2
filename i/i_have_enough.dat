500|$|Long's {{theories}} about animal surgery garnered negative {{attention from the}} scientific {{community as well as}} the literary; biologist William Morton Wheeler wrote to Science in February 1904 that Long's story was [...] "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed." [...] Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that [...] "If scientists and comparative-psychologists are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to fill several regular editions of Science, every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation." [...] As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it [...] "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." [...] None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and Science followed Long's essay with the note, [...] "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

2500|$|The first movement, an aria, {{begins with}} an {{expressive}} melody of the obbligato oboe which is {{picked up by the}} voice on the words [...] (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough).</b> The beginning upward leap of a minor sixth is reminiscent of the aria [...] (Have mercy) in Bach's St Matthew Passion and the aria [...] (When will you come, my salvation?) from [...] The first motif is changed to a phrase that appears at the end of three vocal sections. A similar motif begins the middle section on the words [...] (I have seen him), turning upwards in the end. Klaus Hofmann notes a [...] "feeling of serene contentedness with life" [...] in [...] "elegiac tones" [...] as the aria's expression. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes [...] "that instant when body and soul come to rest and are resigned and in complete harmony. Bach encapsulates this experience of peace and acquiescent submission beyond anything that mere words can convey." [...] He sees the [...] "flowing oboe arabesques", which the singer imitates twice on the word [...] (joy) as a [...] "clear indication that their expressive function is to proclaim the Christian's personal bliss, an inextricable element of this important experience of life".|$|E
