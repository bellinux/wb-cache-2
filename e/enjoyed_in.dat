5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E

5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being <b>enjoyed.</b> <b>In</b> the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated {{the extent to which the}} global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously <b>enjoyed.</b> <b>In</b> order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and {{were told that they}} should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' domination and established a modus vivendi with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E

5|$|Most {{migrants}} {{were people}} from the lower economic strata who had {{been left out of}} government and economic jobs; their lands had been confiscated due to heavy taxation under the Portuguese in Goa. As a consequence of the wealth and privileges which these Goan migrants <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> Mangalore, they began feeling superior to their landless kindred in Goa. Their captivity at Seringapatam (1784–1799), where many died, were killed, or were forcibly converted to Islam, {{led to the formation of}} a separate and common Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity among members of the group, who hitherto had considered themselves an extension of the larger Goan Catholic community. They no longer self-identified as Goan Catholics. After their years of captivity, prosperity under the British and under Italian Jesuits, followed by migration for employment to Bombay, Calcutta, Poona, the Persian Gulf Arab states, and the English-speaking world, enabled the community to restore their identity. The overwhelming majority of Mangalorean Catholics are of Goud Saraswat Brahmin lineage. Historian Alan Machado Prabhu estimates that almost 95 per cent of Mangalorean Catholics have Goan origins.|$|E
5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> the region.|$|E
5|$|The combat that peasant men {{had engaged}} in prior to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for {{a short amount of}} days before returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where peasant fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority in the face of local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial local autonomy that was <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the peasant fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the GameCube {{failed to}} reinvigorate {{flagging}} support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successor, the Wii. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development {{could not keep}} up with demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift toward more aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii would go on {{to become one of the}} most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo has attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> the NES and SNES eras, though its success in this regard has been mixed.|$|E
5|$|While in London, Clarke met {{many of his}} {{counterparts}} on the Western Front. He attended {{meetings of}} the Twenty Committee and Chiefs of Staff Committee (which was chaired by his old commander, John Dill). The paper on deception met with approval in the establishment and {{it was decided that}} a department similar to 'A' Force should be created in London. Clarke was offered the job, reporting directly to the Chiefs of Staff and War Cabinet. He declined, citing loyalty to the Middle East, but his decision was in large part due to the greater operational freedom and status he <b>enjoyed</b> <b>in</b> North Africa. The London Controlling Section was formed and, after some disorganisation, prospered under John Bevan, with whom Clarke would later work closely.|$|E
