Alongside the 1A26 digital computer and the 1G30 angle measurement system form the 1A27 radar complex. Tunguska-M has the 1RL144M radar with detection range 18km and tracking range 16km-near of the original system's. The mechanically scanned target acquisition radar for the Tunguska-M1 offers a 360-degree field of view, a detection range of around 18km and can detect targets flying as low as 15 m, the target acquisition radar can be stowed when in transit. Its tracking radar has a range of 16km. A C/D-band IFF system is also fitted and designated 1RL138. The radar system is highly protected against various types of interference, and can work if there are mountains on the horizon, regardless of the background. [...] The system is able to fire on the move using 30mm cannons, although it must be stationary to fire missiles. The maximum target speed can be up to 500m/s; reaction time 6–8 seconds.

5000|$|In September 2016, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology {{announced}} that the government-led 5G Phase-1 tests of key wireless technologies for future 5G networks were completed with satisfactory results. [...] The tests were carried out in 100 cities and involved seven companies - Datang Telecom, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia Shanghai Bell, Samsung and ZTE. The next step in 5G technology development involving trials is under way, with planned commercial deployment in 2022 or 2023. In April 2017 Huawei {{announced that}} it jointly with Telenor conducted successful 5G tests with speeds up to 70 Gbit/s in a controlled lab environment in Norway. The <b>E-band</b> multi-user MIMO can provide a 20 Gbit/s speed rate for a single user. Working as a supplementary low-frequency band, the <b>E-band</b> improves the user experience of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).|$|E
50|$|The air {{search radar}} is a Fregat-MAE-5 (NATO {{reporting}} name: ‘Top Plate’) 3D air search radar mounted {{at the top}} of the rear mast, offering two channels in <b>E-band.</b> The radar can track up to 40 targets simultaneously, and has a maximum range of 120km to aircraft and 50km to sea-skimming missile.|$|E
50|$|As mobile {{operators}} {{need more}} and more bandwidth, they are turning to new frequency spectrums to lower their wireless backhaul costs. Both license-exempt V band spectrum (57-66 GHz) and the newly allocated <b>E-Band</b> spectrum (71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz and 92-95 GHz) has clear technological and economic advantages. The 20 GHz allocated in this spectrum allows multi-Gigabit per second capacities far exceeding the 6-38 GHz bandwidth-limited frequencies.|$|E
50|$|After {{equipping}} the <b>E-Band</b> converter device, {{power can}} be acquired by destroying enemy ships. Energy crystals or a green fluid held in a beaker can also increase power.

50|$|In 2013 {{the company}} entered the millimeter-wave market with its full-outdoor {{transceivers}} in <b>E-Band.</b> In 2014, the product portfolio included also V band radios for small cell backhaul and NLOS solutions for urban communications which {{may benefit from}} exploiting reflections on buildings {{in order to increase}} coverage. A new network monitoring software was also released in 2014 to offer enhanced features to network operators for managing and evaluating aggregated performances, which are gaining more and more relevance as key figures in the assessment of traffic bottlenecks and overall behavior of a complex network.|$|E
50|$|The system's {{standard}} mode is fully automated and uses radar tracking. Target detection {{is carried out}} using the parent ship's surveillance radars. Originally, in the Type 22 and Sea Wolf equipped Leander class, this was the radar Type 967 / 968 combination; the D-band Type 967 providing long range surveillance and the <b>E-band</b> Type 968 providing short range target indication. On the Type 23 frigates, these functions have {{been taken over by}} the Type 996 3D surveillance radar. Target data is processed by the ship's computers and when the system is live, targets are automatically assigned and engaged without the need for human intervention (although this can be over-ridden by the Missile Director (MD) in the Operations Room).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these assignments, electronic transitions also have so-called bands associated with them. The following bands are defined: the R-band from the German radikalartig or radical-like, the K-band from the German Konjugierte or conjugated, B-band from benzoic and the <b>E-band</b> from ethylenic (system devised by A. Burawoy in 1930). For example, the absorption spectrum for ethane shows a σ → σ* transition at 135 nm and that of water a n → σ* transition at 167 nm with an extinction coefficient of 7,000. Benzene has three aromatic π → π* transitions; two E-bands at 180 and 200 nm and one B-band at 255 nm with extinction coefficients respectively 60,000, 8,000 and 215. These absorptions are not narrow bands but are generally broad because the electronic transitions are superimposed on the other molecular energy states.|$|E
5000|$|As mobile {{operators}} {{need more}} and more bandwidth, they are turning to new frequency bands to lower their wireless backhaul costs. Both license-exempt V band spectrum (57-71 GHz) and E band spectrum (71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz and 92-95 GHz) have clear technological and economic advantages. The 27 GHz allocated in these bands allows multi-Gigabit per second capacities far exceeding the 6-38 GHz bandwidth-limited frequencies.

50|$|At Kell's suggestion, Picard invites Vagh to come {{aboard the}} Enterprise {{to witness the}} {{transport}} logs first hand. As Picard takes Vagh around the ship, Data comes {{to learn that the}} <b>E-band</b> radiation is coming from aboard the Enterprise and that La Forge never made it to Risa. He orders Security Chief Worf to immediately detain La Forge. The assassination attempt is blocked, and Data arrives to explain the situation, saying that the limited transmission range means the device controlling La Forge must either be in Picard's or Kell's possession. Kell refuses to undergo a search, but Vagh offers {{to take him to the}} colony to do so there. Fearing the consequences of being investigated by his own people, Kell quickly requests asylum aboard the Enterprise, which Picard says they will consider after his name is cleared of any wrongdoing by the Klingons. Kell is taken away by Vagh's guards. La Forge is cleared but struggles to understand what happened to him.|$|E
50|$|At the colony, Vagh shows Captain Picard and Kell several Federation {{weapons and}} medical {{supplies}} taken from the rebels. Picard orders his crew to investigate. Commander Data finds that strange <b>E-band</b> radiation is nearby but cannot detect the source. He and La Forge also discover the apparent Federation weapons were replicated using Romulan technology and powered by Romulan energy cells. Later, {{under the direction of}} his controllers, La Forge unknowingly transports a case of Federation weapons from the Enterprise to the rebel base, and then subsequently erases the logs. Vagh, monitoring the transport, immediately accuses the Enterprise of its deception. Data and La Forge review the transport logs but find no evidence for the transport even though the weapons originated from the Enterprise, and realize that only they themselves and two other crewmembers could have falsified the logs in that manner. Again, outside of his control, La Forge enters Kell's quarters on the Enterprise, where it is revealed that Kell was controlling La Forge. Kell orders La Forge to assassinate Vagh in a public setting before witnesses in such a manner as to utterly convince Vagh's people of Federation involvement.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{considerations}} represent typical problems characterizing {{terrestrial radio}} links using microwaves {{for the so-called}} backbone networks: hop lengths of few tens of kilometers (typically 10 to 60 km) were largely used until 1990s. Frequency bands below 10 GHz and, above all, the information to be transmitted was a stream containing a fixed capacity block. The target was to supply the requested availability for the whole block (Plesiochronous digital hierarchy, PDH, or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, SDH). Fading and/or multipath affecting the link for short time period during the day had to be counteracted by the diversity architecture. During 1990s microwave radio links begun widely {{to be used for}} urban links in cellular network. Requirements regarding link distances changed to shorter hops (less than 10 km, typically 3 to 5 km) and frequency increased to bands between 11 and 43 GHz and more recently up to 86 GHz (<b>E-band).</b> Furthermore, link planning deals more with intense rainfall and less with multipath, so diversity schemes became less used. Another big change that occurred during the last decade was evolution towards packet radio transmission. Therefore, new countermeasures, such as adaptive modulation, have been adopted.|$|E

50|$|Chinese {{designers}} {{abandoned the}} development of passive phased array radar and decided to adopt the planar array of MR-710 with the same back-to-back configuration of MR-710, because Chinese industry at the time could not provide a new generation passive phased array with the reliability and performance level required by Chinese navy. The more matured planar array of MR-710 not only provided better reliability, but also {{proved to be more}} capable than the domestic Chinese passive phased array designed in the mid-1990s. However, Chinese passive phased array Type 381 does have its advantage over its Russian counterpart in that the equipment below deck is far more compact and reliable. Type 382 design was hence altered to combine the best of two systems by integrating the planar array of MR-710 above the deck and the electronic cabinets and operator consoles of Type 381 below deck together. As a result, the original more than 20 cabinets of MR-710 is drastically reduced on the Type 382. However, the most significant difference between MR-710 and Type 382 is that the former is only a single band radar operates at <b>E-band,</b> while the latter is a dual band radar operates at two frequency bands: S (E/F) and C (G/H) bands. Hence Type 382 also has a name: Sea Eagle (Hai-Ying, 海鹰) S/C, named after the frequency bands it operates at. Maximum power of Type 382 is increased to 100 kW from the 90 kW of the original MR-710., while the maximum range against a fighter sized target is increased to 250 km from the original 230 km of MR-710. In addition to stronger power and higher precision, the rotation rate of Type 382 is increased from the original 12/min to nearly 30/min and scan rate is also nearly doubled.|$|E
40|$|With the {{formidable}} growth of various booming wireless communication services that require ever-increasing data throughputs, the conventional microwave band below 10 GHz, {{which is currently}} used by almost all mobile communication systems, is going to reach its saturation point within just a few years. Therefore, the attention of radio system designers has been pushed towards ever-higher segments of the frequency spectrum in a quest for capacity increase. In this article, we investigate the feasibility, advantages and challenges of future wireless communications over the <b>E-band</b> frequencies. We start from {{a brief review of}} the history of <b>E-band</b> spectrum and its light licensing policy as well as benefits/challenges. Then we introduce the propagation characteristics of <b>E-band</b> signals, based on which some potential fixed and mobile applications at the <b>E-band</b> are investigated. In particular, we analyze the achievability of non-trivial multiplexing gain in fixed point-to-point <b>E-band</b> links and propose an <b>E-band</b> mobile broadband (EMB) system as a candidate for the next generation mobile communication networks.

40|$|The {{allocation}} {{of a large}} amount of bandwidth by regulating bodies in the 70 / 80 GHz band, i. e., the <b>E-band,</b> has opened up new potentials and challenges for providing affordable and reliable Gigabit per second wireless point-to-point links. This article first reviews the available bandwidth and licensing regulations in the <b>E-band.</b> Subsequently, different propagation models, e. g., the ITU-R and Cane models, are compared against measurement results and it is concluded that to meet specific availability requirements, <b>E-band</b> wireless systems may need to be designed with larger fade margins compared to microwave systems. A similar comparison is carried out between measurements and models for oscillator phase noise. It is confirmed that phase noise characteristics, that are neglected by the models used for narrowband systems, need {{to be taken into account}} for the wideband systems deployed in the <b>E-band.</b> Next, a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transceiver design, termed continuous aperture phased (CAP) -MIMO, is presented. Simulations show that CAP-MIMO enables <b>E-band</b> systems to achieve fiber-optic like throughputs. Finally, it is argued that full-duplex relaying can be used to greatly enhance the coverage of <b>E-band</b> systems without sacrificing throughput, thus, facilitating their application in establishing the backhaul of heterogeneous networks.

30|$|Considerations are {{required}} {{in terms of}} feasibility and link range of the potential solution, i.e., LOS link is a strict condition for microwave and <b>E-band</b> solutions, and <b>E-band</b> solutions are also restricted to a link range of less than 1 km. Redundancy infrastructure to cope with accidental disconnection and load balancing is not considered in this paper.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to derive the {{methodology}} {{for the design of}} a broadband microwave backhaul link in the <b>E-band,</b> based on the ITU-R P. 530 Recommendation and ETSI. The radio link designed will be placed in the city of Krakow and it will reach a rate of 1 Gbps. For decades, microwave radios in the 6 to 50 GHz bands have been providing wireless communications. Recently, newer technologies at the 60 to 100 GHz mm-wave bands have taken advantage of new wireless regulations that are designed to enable ultra-high capacity communications. As we pursue this project, we are going to find out the latest details of multi-gigabit wireless communications in depth and review the currently technology available. The project will cover both, generic aspects and <b>E-band</b> specific aspects. To estimate generic aspects of the radio link such as selection of the base stations, polarization, antenna height calculations; the software Radio Mobile will be used. Also a broad explanation of <b>E-band</b> will be exposed (channel plans aggregations, frequency planning process, specific licensing for <b>E-band</b> in Europe [...] .).
