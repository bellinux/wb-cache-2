In 1929, Hubble and Milton Humason formulated the empirical Redshift <b>Distance</b> <b>Law</b> of galaxies, nowadays known as Hubble's law, which, once the redshift is interpreted {{as a measure of}} recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein's General Relativity Equations for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space.

It was this interpretation that led to the concept of the expanding universe. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. This discovery later resulted in the formulation of the Big Bang model.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of a bulk photon mass in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati type brane model with Maxwell terms both on the brane and in the bulk, as {{proposed}} by Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman. The motivation to include the bulk photon mass is to suppress radiation loss into the bulk. We point out that this modifies the photon propagator {{in such a way that}} it generates a small photon mass on the brane. Compatibility with present bounds on a photon mass imply that the transition to five-dimensional <b>distance</b> <b>laws</b> for the electromagnetic potentials would appear only at super-horizon length scales, thus excluding any direct detection possibility of a transition from four-dimensional to five-dimensional <b>distance</b> <b>laws</b> in electromagnetic interactions.

50|$|Stouffer theorises {{that the}} amount of {{migration}} over a given distance is directly proportional to the number of opportunities at the place of destination, and inversely proportional to the number of opportunities between the place of departure and the place of destination. These intervening opportunities may persuade a migrant to settle in a place in the route rather than proceeding to the originally planned destination. Stouffer argued that the volume of migration had less to do with distance and population totals than with the opportunities in each location.

40|$|Many cyclist {{deaths and}} serious {{injuries}} result from rear-end or sideswipe collisions involving {{a car or}} heavy vehicle. As a consequence, minimum passing <b>distance</b> <b>laws</b> (often referred to as ‘one metre rules’) have been introduced {{in a number of}} U. S. states along with European countries such as France, Belgium and Spain. A two-year trial of a minimum passing distance rule is underway in Queensland. The international studies show that while the average passing distance is more than one metre, significant proportions of passes occur at less than this distance. Average passing distances are greater with wider lanes, when bicycle lanes are present, for cars rather than vans or trucks, and (possibly) at higher speed limits. Perceived characteristics of the cyclist (other than gender) appear to have little effect on passing distances. The research questions the ability to judge lateral distance and whether nominated distances predict on-road behaviour. Cyclists have strong concerns about drivers passing too close but the extent to which this behaviour reflects deliberate intimidation versus an inability to judge what is a safe passing distance is not clear.

40|$|AbstractThe Pure <b>Distance</b> <b>Law</b> predicts {{grouping}} by proximity in dot lattices {{that can}} be organised in four ways by grouping dots along parallel lines. It specifies a quantitative relationship between the relative probability of perceiving an organisation and the relative distance between the grouped dots. The current study {{was set up to}} investigate whether this principle holds both for centrally and for eccentrically displayed dot lattices. To this end, dot lattices were displayed either in central vision, or to the right of fixation with their closest border at 3 ° or 15 °. We found that the Pure <b>Distance</b> <b>Law</b> adequately predicted grouping of centrally displayed dot lattices but did not capture the eccentric data well, even when the eccentric dot lattices were scaled. Specifically, a better fit was obtained when we included the possibility in the model that in some trials participants could not report an organisation and consequently responded randomly. A plausible interpretation for the occurrence of random responses in the eccentric conditions is that under these circumstances an attention shift is required from the locus of fixation towards the dot lattice, which occasionally fails to take place. When grouping could be reported, scale and eccentricity appeared to interact. The effect of the relative interdot distances on the perceptual organisation of the dot lattices was estimated to be stronger in peripheral vision than in central vision at the two largest scales, but this difference disappeared when the smallest scale was applied...|$|E
