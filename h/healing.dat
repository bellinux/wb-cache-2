5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main <b>healing</b> current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that <b>healing</b> is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic <b>healing,</b> herbal medicine, <b>healing</b> using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal <b>healing</b> has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Magical <b>healing</b> spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for <b>healing</b> rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking <b>healing</b> poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the <b>healing</b> power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed <b>healing</b> spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
