30|$|Turbidity is {{a measure}} of the degree to which water loses its {{transparency}} due to the presence of suspended particulates. Measured turbidity values ranged from 14 to 91  FAU. There are various parameters that may influence the cloudiness of the water. Some of these are sediments from erosion, resuspended sediments from the bottom (frequently stir up by bottom feeders like carp), waste discharge, algae growth and urban runoff. The more total suspended solids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>murkier</b> it seems and the higher the turbidity (APHA 1992). The suspended particles also help the attachment of heavy metals and many other toxic organic compounds.|$|R

40|$|Turbidity is {{a measure}} of the clarity of water. The greater the amount of {{suspended}} solids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>murkier</b> it appears and the higher the measured turbidity. The major source of turbidity from construction- and development-related activities is sediment. Fine sediments (clay and fine silt) are so slow to settle that water containing them will remain turbid for days or weeks even if held in a settling or stilling basin. Turbidity can have a number of undesirable effects on the environment. Heavy suspended sediment loads and turbidity reduce light penetration for aquatic plants, fill lakes and bays, and smother benthic habitats. Fine particulate material also can clog or damage sensitive gill structures, decrease their resistance to disease, prevent proper egg and larval development, and potentially interfere with feeding. Very high levels of turbidity for a short period of time or lower turbidity for longer periods can both have significant impacts on aquatic organisms. Turbid water also tends to absorb sunlight, increasing temperature and decreasing the dissolved oxygen level, and stressing or even killing <b>the</b> organisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.

2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, {{if you have}} an obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide on your next move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to catch your opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He will probably have considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to your second or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murky</b> waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 October 1996, {{the book}} was {{reviewed}} by Professor Brendan Simms, Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in the Times Higher Education Supplement. Simms observed that Cohen's book was [...] "a revisionist work in that it overturns conventional wisdom, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>murky</b> or dubious sense connotated by Holocaust [...] "revisionism". First of all, Cohen never disputes that hundreds of thousands—but not millions—of Serbs died horribly, and often {{for no other reason}} than that they were Serbs. Second, despite the fact that Cohen is not a trained historian, his central thesis of extensive Serbian collaboration with Nazi Germany is well supported by the evidence". Simms mentioned that Cohen [...] "somewhat blurs" [...] but does not suppress the fundamental qualitative difference between the Croatian and Serbian involvement in The Holocaust, in that the Croatian involvement was led by the Croatian fascist Ustaše with German assistance, but the Serb involvement was led by the Germans with support from collaborationist Serbs. Simms noted that [...] "in places Cohen gives the Croats the benefit of the doubt", but states that [...] "one of this affects Cohen's central argument: [...] "Serbia" [...] and many Serbs collaborated with Nazi Germany".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Jones starred as Marlene, a career-woman {{living in}} Thatcher's Britain, in the Minerva Theatre's {{production}} of Top Girls by Caryl Churchill in Chichester.

In August 2011, {{it was announced that}} Jones would star alongside John Hannah in a spoof detective drama written by Charlie Brooker and Daniel Maier called A Touch of Cloth. The programme aired in August 2012 on Sky1. Jones plays DC Anne Oldman, the [...] "plucky, no-nonsense sidekick" [...] of DCI Jack Cloth (Hannah). In March 2012, Jones began filming The Secret of Crickley Hall, a BBC1 dramatisation of the 2006 best selling novel by James Herbert. She plays the lead role of Eve Caleigh, a woman who moves to Crickley Hall in an attempt to move on from the loss of her son, only to be haunted by supernatural occurrences. Jones described the series as a [...] "classic haunted house spine-chiller with an emotional family story at its heart." [...] Jones returned to the London stage in 2013 in a 20th anniversary revival of Jonathan Harvey's play, Beautiful Thing. The play ran between 13 April and 25 May at the Arts Theatre, London, before a short national tour. In 2013 Jones starred as herself in Playhouse Presents: [...] "Stage Door Johnnies", a comedy mockumentary about obsessive theatre fans airing on Sky Arts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article is to analyze the {{consequences}} of taxing active foreign business income, 1 and in particular, to compare a regime in which a home country taxes foreign income to a regime in which it does not. In practice, countries typically do not adopt such extreme policy positions. For example, a country such as France, which largely exempts foreign business income from taxation, nevertheless taxes small pieces of foreign income; 2 and a country such as the United States, which attempts to tax the foreign incomes of U. S. corporations, permits taxpayers to defer home country taxation in some circumstances, claim foreign tax credits in most situations, 3 and in other ways avoid the consequences of full home country taxation. It is nevertheless useful to consider stylized and somewhat extreme versions of territoriality and residence taxation, <b>in</b> part because <b>the</b> older theory that forms the basis of much U. S. policy advocates {{in favor of an}} extreme position of taxing worldwide income, and in part because insights drawn from considering extreme examples prove useful <b>in</b> understanding <b>the</b> <b>murky</b> middle to which tax policies naturally tend in practice...|$|R

5|$|A {{review of}} <b>the</b> book <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} {{the work to}} multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent <b>in</b> debating <b>the</b> <b>murky</b> concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|R
