50|$|Starting in 1980, {{they have}} {{increasingly}} used Vietnam War-era turboshaft engines from helicopters (in 1973-1974, one hydroplane, U-95, used turbine <b>engines</b> in <b>races</b> to <b>test</b> the technology). The {{most commonly used}} turbine is the Lycoming T55, used in the CH-47 Chinook.|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{majority}} of its major competitors (other than the Williams FW09), the car used an all carbon fibre chassis pioneered by the car's designer John Barnard with its predecessor, the MP4/1. The car was powered by a 1.5 Litre, 90° V6 TAG-Porsche turbo engine that produced ( [...] in race set-up and up to [...] in qualifying set-up i.e. with maximum turbo pressure. It was first used in the 1983 Dutch Grand Prix, at the insistence of veteran Niki Lauda, who felt that the new <b>engine</b> required <b>race</b> <b>testing</b> before a championship challenge could be mounted. The MP4/1, which until then had raced with the Cosworth DFY V8 engine, was modified to MP4/1E specs to take the new engine and in the final race of the 1983 season in South Africa, Lauda proved the car was competitive, running {{at the front of the}} field and challenging for the lead of the race. He was running second with only six laps remaining, but his race ended with electrical failure on lap 71 of the Kyalami circuit.|$|R
50|$|The expense {{for these}} cars is {{extremely}} high. The cost for one complete race-ready late model is around $70,000. There is also cheaper equipment and parts {{that can be}} purchased, but staying competitive is much more expensive. To get the frame (chassis) and parts all new without the transmission and motor is around 20,000 to 30,000 dollars depending on the quality and from which manufacturer the chassis comes. The manufacturers around the country include Rocket, Sweet-Bloomquist, Club 29, Longhorn, Moyer's Victory Chassis, Black Diamond Racecars, GRT, Warrior, Barry Wright Racecars, Rayburn, MasterSbilt and Swartz <b>Race</b> Cars. The <b>engines</b> for these cars are around 850 horsepower and can cost up to 40,000 dollars.
