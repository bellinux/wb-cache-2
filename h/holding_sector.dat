40|$|Identifying {{the exact}} holder or the <b>holding</b> <b>sector</b> of {{securities}} is always {{one of the}} most challenging tasks for statistical compilers. Recently, some central banks and statistical authorities have started projects to build up securities databases to store information on securities holders. This paper introduces the Bank of Japan’s recent exploration of the central securities depository (CSD) data as a statistical source of securities holders ’ information. First, it explains the features of the CSD in Japan. Second, it introduces the improvement in the flow of funds accounts statistics implemented in March 2010. Third, it argues the challenges to develop CSD data as a statistical source to identify final holders of securities. This paper concludes that using CSD data is one approach to solve data gap problems. Key words: CSD, security by security, data gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{strong and}} {{prolonged}} deviation of money growth from its reference value since 2001 has caused concern among policy-makers about the upside risks to price stability from monetary developments. In this paper we {{provide evidence that}} these risks might be smaller than previously assumed. We provide a sectoral breakdown of money holdings and show that current excess liquidity conditions are in some measure related to the acceleration of non-bank financial intermediariesÂ’ money demand, {{as well as to}} the accumulation of marketable instruments. Such increases are likely to be related more to portfolio choices than to transaction motives. We also find evidence from balance sheet data on investment funds that points to a general increase of this sector in the economy, rather than to a higher degree of liquidity of their asset positions. This is likely to imply that recent dynamics reflect, to a large extent, a permanent change in the financial structure of the economy. Finally, our sectoral analysis suggests that the threat to price stability did not appear before the end of 2005, which is also when the ECB started to raise the official interest rates. money <b>holding</b> <b>sector,</b> excess liquidity, money supply...|$|E

40|$|Evidence on long-run and short-run {{relationship}} {{among the major}} stock indexes in the highly concentrated Athens stock exchange (ASE) is provided utilizing daily data for the period 01 / 01 / 96 to 31 / 12 / 03. The findings suggest {{that even though the}} sector indexes do not show a consistent and strong long-term relationship, the banking sector seems to have a strong influence on returns and volatility of other sectors at least in the short-run. The variance decomposition analysis confirms that although the variance of returns for most sectors is largely influenced by their own innovations, banking sector is able to explain 25 % of variance of construction and insurance sectors and around 15 % of the variance of industrial, investment and the <b>holding</b> <b>sectors.</b> The leading role of the banking sector implies that changes in the banking sector index could be potentially used in predicting short term movements in other sector indexes confirming that the ASE is not weak form efficient. ...|$|R
