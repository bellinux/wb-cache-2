2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper.</b> A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E

50|$|Brabus also {{includes}} many aesthetic {{changes to the}} standard E-Class. Developed in a wind tunnel, the E V12 features an aerodynamic kit made from lightweight, high strength carbon-fiber increasing {{the width of the}} car by 36 millimeters (1.4 inches). This wider stance proves to be useful for stability at higher speeds. The cars sits on Monoblock Q wheels size 9.5Jx19 wrapped around Yokohama tyres. The front axle features 265/35 ZR 19 tyres while the rear sport 285/30 ZR 19 tyres. Stopping comes courtesy of 12-piston aluminum <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> and steel discs, measuring 380 x 37 millimeters (15.0 x 1.5 inches). At the rear six-piston aluminum <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> measuring 360 x 28 millimeters (14.2 x1.1 inches).|$|R
2500|$|The front discs are [...] in {{diameter}} and [...] thick, and use gloss black Brembo monoblock eight-opposed-piston <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> from the Lamboroghini Gallardo Supercar but with Red/Silver 'RS4' logos. These and the transmission are supplied with a cooling airflow directed from NACA ducts located in the engine front undertray.|$|R
50|$|The R-100 models {{received}} a double disc brake {{in the front}} wheel. For 1976 to 1979 models the front brake was a pivot caliper ATE disc actuated from the controls via cable to a brake master cylinder under the tank. From 1980 models onwards front brakes were changed to a Brembo <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> brake, and the master cylinder was moved from undertank to the right handlebar. With the introduction of Monolever models in 1986, the Brembo fixed calipers were mounted on the fork tubes. The back brake was initially a drum brake. Starting in the 1978 model year (September 1977), the R 100 RS and RT and S models {{received a}} Brembo rear disc brake with <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> on the rear wheel, and from model year 1986 the drum brake returned.|$|E

50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper. 'A' models have a trailing piston which {{is smaller than}} the leading piston but the later 'C' models have identical leading and trailing pistons, dramatically improving front braking. 'A' model owners often fit caliper units from 'C' models. As for most motorcycles, another common braking upgrade is to reduce sponginess by replacing the OEM brake hose with a braided brake hose.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking system}} was {{composed}} of vented and grooved steel front and rear brake discs, with 12-piston aluminum <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> for the front brakes and six-piston calipers for the rear. The wheels were nineteen inch one-piece Brabus Monoblock F wheels with Yokohama Advan Sport tires (255/35 ZR 19 front, 285/30 ZR 19 rear).|$|R

The bike has a front 110/70 R17 and a rear 150/60 R17 tyre. The braking of the bike features anti-lock braking system, with the front using a single 300 mm discs, radially-bolted 4-piston <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> brake and the rear, a single 240 mm disc, single-piston floating caliper brake. The fuel capacity is 11 L.|$|E
50|$|For 1969, ALL full sized Chrysler Corp {{vehicles}} {{returned to}} standard 15” wheels. This accommodated the growing share of cars equipped with front disc brakes, which were updated {{to a new}} simpler and less costly single piston sliding caliper design from the earlier 4-piston <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> type. Once again, Chrysler sales literature listed power front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town and Country. But, once again, some left the factory with front drum brakes instead. Regardless of brake type, all T&Cs wore standard size 8.85x15 tires on 6.5”x15” heavy duty rims. Powertrain choices for Town and Country remained unchanged.|$|E

5000|$|Porsche-designed braking and {{suspension}} systems {{replaced the}} standard Audi 80 equipment, however, the Bosch Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) was retained. The front brakes feature either 304 mm in diameter by 32 mm thick radially vented brake discs, and use Brembo four-opposed piston <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers,</b> or a 'modified' option of larger discs (which will only fit under a 17" [...] wheel) of 322 mm by 32 mm, with uprated brake pads. The rears featured 299 mm by 24 mm radially vented discs, again with Brembo four-piston calipers, and the 'modified' option included identical sized discs, but merely included cross-drilling, along with uprated pads. The handbrake {{worked on the}} rears, and consisted of a cable operated 'drum in disc' system.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a version}} of Audi R8 V12 TDI concept with Brilliant Red body colour, rhombus-pattern cover on the air inlets and outlets, {{continuous}} aluminum spoiler lip, glass roof of the passenger compartment with two large transparent sections, glazed engine compartment behind seats, NACA duct {{in the middle of}} the roof, optional carbon fiber engine liner, LED headlights with color temperature of 6,000 kelvin, 365 mm three-spoke flat bottom diecast magnesium core sport steering wheel upholstered in Valcona leather, larger aluminum applications at around the center console, 24-piston (total) brake calipers (red six-piston monobloc aluminum front <b>calipers,</b> <b>fixed</b> rear <b>calipers),</b> ventilated carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide ceramic brake discs.|$|R

5000|$|For the 1985 model year, Porsche {{introduced}} the 944 Turbo, known internally as the 951. This had a turbocharged and intercooled {{version of the}} standard car's engine that produced [...] ( [...] in the US) at 6000 rpm. In 1987, Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo and achieved a 0-60 mph time of 5.9 seconds. The Turbo was the first car using a ceramic port liner to retain exhaust gas temperature and new forged pistons and {{was also the first}} vehicle to produce identical power output with or without a catalytic converter. The Turbo also featured several other changes, such as improved aerodynamics, notably an integrated front bumper. This featured the widest turn signals (indicators) fitted to any production car, a strengthened gearbox with a different final drive ratio, standard external oil coolers for both the engine and transmission, standard 16 inch wheels (optional forged Fuchs wheels), and a slightly stiffer suspension (progressive springs) to handle the extra weight. The Turbo's front and rear brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 911, with Brembo 4-piston <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> and 12-inch discs as ABS also came standard. Engine component revisions, more than thirty in all, were made to the 951 to compensate for increased internal loads and heat.|$|R
5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting threaded collars {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{invention}} of the pointing machine by Gatteaux, sculptors used several methods to measure and copy sculpture, such as grids, which were already in use in early Egyptian sculpture, plumb-bobs, measuring sticks and calipers.

50|$|Drum brakes {{are also}} {{occasionally}} fitted as the parking (and emergency) brake {{even when the}} rear wheels use disc brakes as the main brakes. Many rear disc braking systems use a parking brake in which the piston in the caliper is actuated by a cam or screw. This compresses the pads against the rotor. However, this type of system becomes much more complicated when the rear disc brakes use <b>fixed,</b> multi-piston <b>calipers.</b> In this situation, a small drum is usually fitted within {{or as part of}} the brake disc. This type of brake is also known as a banksia brake.|$|R

50|$|The {{faces of}} the {{speedometer}} and tachometer were changed from a blue background to brown to match {{the appearance of the}} instruments on the GS models. There was also a change in the plastic used as lens because it no longer developed serious opacity and cracks after long exposure to sunlight. The instruments did not get the then-unique rose-colored backlighting that the GS models had. The front brake caliper was changed to a pivoting unit made by Asco rather than the <b>fixed</b> Tokico <b>caliper</b> that had been supplied from the introduction of the disc brake system. The GT and GS series were sold side by side during this one year overlap. This was the last MY for GT550 production. This MY sales were ~6,000+ making this the rarest of all the 550 models.|$|R
