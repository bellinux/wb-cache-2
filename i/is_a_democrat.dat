500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology.

[...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue.
