The augmentation of graft compatibility contributes significantly in horticulture, floriculture and forestry production. The graft compatibility and its augmentation depend upon various natural factors like environment, weather, soil conditions and protective measures etc. The present study examines the role of external electric field on augmentation of graft compatibility. For this purpose, the external forward and reverse DC electric currents of 5, 10, 20 and 30 microampere were passed across the scion and stock in more than two hundred specimens of the Rosa indica graft for 24 hours after grafting and their percentage growths were recorded.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Our {{previous}} {{experience with the}} traditional management of infected prosthetic arterial grafts, which included graft excision and vein patch repair of the involved artery, was complicated by {{a high incidence of}} vein patch rupture. This study assessed the treatment of infected prosthetic grafts with subtotal graft excision and oversewing of small graft remnants. Methods: During the last 20 years, we treated 53 wounds involving 45 infected prosthetic grafts in 42 patients by means of subtotal graft excision and oversewing of a residual 2 - to 3 -mm graft remnant (patch) at an intact arterial anastomosis. This technique was selectively used to maintain patency of small-diameter arteries (41 common femoral, five deep femoral, three axillary, two iliac, and two popliteal), which were critical for limb salvage or amputation healing. This strategy avoided difficult dissection of the underlying artery in scarred wounds and obviated the placement of a new patch in an infected <b>field.</b> <b>Graft</b> remnants were polytetrafluoroethylene in 51 cases and Dacron in two cases. Of the 45 grafts, 31 were occluded and 14 were patent. All infected tissue was widely debrided, wet-to-dry dressing changes were performed three times daily, and appropriate intravenous antibiotics were administered for at least 1 week. Secondary bypass grafting procedures were performed as needed to achieve limb salvage. The follow-up period in surviving patients averaged 32 months (range, 1 to 218 months). Results: No complications were directly attributable to prosthetic patch remnants in 92 % of cases (49 of 53 cases). Six of 42 patients (14 %) died during hospitalization (three of cardiac complications and three of sepsis with multiple organ failure). Two infected pseudoaneurysms developed 8 and 34 months after surgery, and two wounds failed to heal. Sixteen secondary bypass grafting procedures were necessary to achieve limb salvage. Patch oversewing led to limb salvage without the need for secondary revascularization in 26 other cases and to the successful healing of 10 amputated limbs when secondary revascularization was not possible. Conclusion: Prosthetic patch remnants are a useful adjunct that simplify management of infected prosthetic grafts, are associated with a low incidence of wound complications, and help maintain patency of essential collaterals to achieve limb salvage or heal an amputation.

40|$|Rana pipiens {{with skin}} dorosoventrally {{reversed}} {{can respond to}} stimulation of the back with forelimb wipes to the belly and to stimulation of the belly with hindlimb wipes to the back. These “misdirected wiping responses” have been {{explained in terms of}} two alternative hypotheses of nerve regeneration: nerve respecification or selective reinnervation. Experimental behavioral and neurophysiological experiments reported here support the selective reinnervation hypothesis. Severing ventral nerves, which normally innervate the belly, greatly reduced the percentage of misdirected responses on stimulation of belly skin grafted to the back, while severing dorsal nerves, which normally innervate the back, increased the percentage of misdirected responses elicited under the same circumstances. Moreover, neurophysiological recordings of grafted animals showed three effects of skin grafting on nerve distributions: (i) termination of dorsal and ventral nerve receptive <b>field</b> at <b>graft</b> edges; (ii) overlap of nonadjacent ventral nerve receptive fields; and (iii) dorsal coursing of ventral nerves to reinnervate target belly skin displaced to the back.

Blood samples for cardiac troponin T were collected at 30 minutes prior to, 6 and 24 hours after surgery. Results One patient in external tournique occlusion and two patients in intraluminal-left anterior descending shunt group were excluded from futher analysis due to preoperative cardiac troponin T level above the 99 th-percentile. Postoperatively, each six patients in external tournique occlusion (33. 3 %) and intraluminal-left anterior descending shunt (35. 3 %) group were above the 99 th-percentile.

40|$|Introduction: Salivary gland {{tumors are}} {{relatively}} rare and constitute 3 - 4 % of all {{head and neck}} neoplasms. The majority (70 %) of salivary gland tumors arise in the parotid gland. Recommended treatment for a parotid mass is surgical excision with a surrounding cuff of normal tissue to prevent recurrence. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 300 patients who were operated by a single surgeon for parotidectomy over a 20 -year period in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. The patients' age, sex, operation findings, pathology report and type of surgery (parotidectomy or mastoidectomy) were analyzed. Results: In 25 cases {{we had to find}} the nerve in a retrograde fashion by finding the distal branches and dissecting backwards to reach the mass, whereas in 275 patients the trunk of the facial nerve was approached in a conventional antegrade fashion. Twelve cases needed some sort of repair on the nerve due to a trauma in the surgical <b>field,</b> either <b>grafting</b> or anastomosis was done. Interestingly mastoidectomy was required in 5 of our cases. The aim of these mastoidectomies was to eradicate the malignancy in cases where a perineural invasion was present. It also gave us a chance to find a normal proximal nerve ending in order to perform a safe nerve reconstruction (grafting or anastomosis).

However, there are some difficulties with cylindrical grafts, such as potential dead space between grafts and insufficient coverage. Hexagonal graft (honeycomb model) was created and evaluated in this biomechanical study. Hypothesis was that harvesting grafts with hexagonal shape, which has the best volume geometry characteristics in nature, would be biomechanically advantageous and provide superior pull-out strength. Methods: Total of 24 fresh calf femurs were divided into 3 equal groups. In the first group, 1 cylindrical and 1 hexagonal graft were compared. Second group consisted of 3 cylindrical and 3 hexagonal grafts. Third group was designed to evaluate effect of graft depth; hexagonal graft implanted at 5  mm depth was compared with 20 -mm-deep hexagonal graft. All specimens were subjected to pull-out test. Friction <b>field</b> and <b>graft</b> surface area were also evaluated. Results: Pull-out strength comparison of 15 -mm-deep triple cylindrical grafts and 15 -mm-deep triple hexagonal grafts in second group revealed statistically significant difference in favor of hexagonal grafts (p <  0. 05). Surface area of cylindrical graft with 9 -mm diameter was calculated to be 50. 27  mm 2, while hexagonal graft surface area was 55. 425  mm 2.

This idea {{was inspired by the}} fact that the design orientation of animation has changed from the simple and single “object design ” to the complex and comprehensive “field design”, the compound of many animation designs of film and television, derivatives design, theme park and game design, etc. Animation products are finished during the “format ” period of animation <b>field.</b> By <b>grafting</b> with business operation and activities, the animation industry is established by interaction of “format ” and business activities, and thus we entered into the “operation type” phase of animation field. Most current animation designs stay in this phase. In the end, this paper gives the outlook of the possibility and necessity for operation type stage to develope into the ecology stage. The visual effects of format period and the economic goals of operation type period is no longer the standard of outstanding animation, while the goal of co-existing with human takes the place. The ecology stage, against near-sighted visual stimulation, advocates the communication and integration with human values. Based on this, the animation design is becoming an autologous haematopoietic entity and a huge field filled with vitality, comprising and absorbing like a huge sponge. It can get the long last vitality by audiences’ recognition and its evolution. Instead of unsustainable design derived from pop culture, it’s a new development approach for the upgrade from “format-operation type ” to “ecology ” of animation design and should be taken into consideration.

There are several genetic causes which could influence the outcome of renal transplantation. One of the main determining factors of success in renal transplantation is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility between donor and recipient, particularly at HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR loci. HLA compatibility remains an essential immunological barrier, despite modern immunosuppressive treatments. There is also evidence that natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity contributes to the immune response which modulates the outcome of renal transplantation. However, the clinical impact of combinations of KIR genes (family of NK cell receptors) and their HLA ligands in donor and recipient still remains to be clearly established. Furthermore, cytokines are involved in the immune reaction against the renal transplant, but the implication of the genetic polymorphism of cytokines is strongly debated. Therefore, while HLA compatibility remains a primordial component for any renal transplantation, it would be premature to use the two other genetic aspects as criteria for organ allocation and as prognostic factors...|$|R

This distinctive type of mango is sour and bitter with very unique and variable aromas. Harvested from the wild for household consumption and for sale in the central Western Ghats, India, it is a commodity of commerce. It is a major source of income for the rural farmers who are still dependent on the collection of WPM from the forest areas.

The bilayer is maintained in a tensionless state using a barostat. Simulations are carried Out by varying the grafting fraction, G(f), defined as {{the ratio of the}} number of polymer molecules to the number of lipid molecules, and the length of the lipid tails. At low G(f), the bilayer shows I sharp transition from the gel (L-beta) to the liquid-crystalline (L-alpha) phase. This main melting transition temperature is lowered as G(f) is increased, and above a critical value of G(f), the interdigitated L-beta I phase is observed prior to the main transition. The temperature range over which the intermediate phases are observed {{is a function of the}} lipid tail length and G(f). At higher grafting fractions, the presence of the L-beta I, phase is attributed to the increase in the area per head group due to the lateral pressure exerted by the polymer brush. The areal expansion and decrease in the melting temperatures as a function of G(f) were found to follow the scalings predicted by the self-consistent mean <b>field</b> theories for <b>grafted</b> polymer membranes. Our study shows that the grafted polymer density can be used to effectively control the temperature range and occurrence of a given bilayer phase...|$|R
40|$|Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is an {{important}} root crop in Uganda, where yield potential and quality attributes have not been fully exploited due to limited breeding efforts and poor knowledge on the inheritance {{of some of its}} agronomic traits. A study was carried out at Makerere University to phenotypically characterise selected sweetpotato cultivars with special reference to sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) resistance, growth habit, flowering and seed set ability, tuber yield and shape, tuber skin and flesh colour, dry matter, starch, sugar and β-carotene content. Twenty cultivars were selected for use in the assessment of their breeding potential and for improvement of yield and quality attributes. Cultivar Munyeera displayed the highest level of SPVD resistance followed by New Kawogo and Polyster as exhibited by relative area under disease progress curves following natural <b>field</b> infection and <b>graft</b> inoculation with SPVD causing viruses, Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus and Sweet potato feathery mottle virus. Flowering ability was low in some cultivars and a few did not flower at all. Some cultivars e. g. Munyeera, New Kawogo, Silk and Sowola which showed high flowering ability failed to fertilise and set seed when crossed to specific cultivars. Preliminary genetic analysis for yield and quality following crossing elite 7 female and 6 male cultivars in a North Carolina 2 mating design showed wide genetic variability in the F 1 s for the important traits, and heterosis was observed for some traits such as tuber size an...|$|R
