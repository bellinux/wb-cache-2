500|$|A toothcomb (also tooth comb or dental comb) is {{a dental}} {{structure}} {{found in some}} mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged {{in a manner that}} facilitates grooming, similar to a <b>hair</b> <b>comb.</b> [...] The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates (which includes lemurs and lorisoids), treeshrews, colugos, hyraxes, and some African antelopes. [...] The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward {{at the front of the}} lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first premolar. [...] The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple [...] per tooth.|$|E

Some modern and experimental comb designs are complex in the way that they direct the air.|$|E

5000|$|Litema (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled Ditema; Singular: Tema, Sesotho for [...] "field") {{is a form}} of Sotho mural art {{composed}} of decorative geometric patterns, commonly associated with the South Sotho tradition today practised in Lesotho and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are scratched with a forefinger or <b>hair</b> <b>comb</b> into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster, and are then painted with natural dyes or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns resemble objects from the natural world and most often mimic ploughed fields or depict plant and animal life, sometimes associated with clan totems. Litema are not a permanent facade design, but decay in the sun or may be washed away by a heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on special occasions such as a wedding or a religious ceremony.|$|E
