40|$|The {{relationship}} between chairs and divisions chiefs with faculty colleagues in departments {{of obstetrics and}} gynecology has important but heretofore unexplored ethical dimensions. Based on the ethical concept of fiduciary responsibility and contractual obligations, this paper provides ethically justified practical guidance <b>for</b> <b>academic</b> physician <b>leaders</b> in the identification, management, and prevention of conflicts in their relationships with faculty colleagues. The framework is developed in contrast with the fiduciary-contractual dimensions of the physician 9 ̆ 6 patient relationship and is articulated in terms of the ethical principles of beneficence, respect for autonomy, and justice. The distinctive nature of the <b>academic</b> physician <b>leader</b> 9 ̆ 6 colleague relationship is that beneficence-based obligations and justice-based obligations to colleagues can often justifiably override autonomy-based obligations to colleagues, about which it is crucial <b>for</b> <b>academic</b> <b>leaders</b> to be transparent in making and implementing leadership decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case study was to understand how coaching support structures enabled and sustained leadership practices of urban principals. The study investigated how the intervention of coaching <b>for</b> <b>academic</b> <b>leaders</b> can serve as evidence based professional development for building leadership capacity. The central focus was on principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of coaching engagements over time to identify recurring themes and essential elements of the coach-to-client relationship. With a goal of meeting 21 st century school accountability requirements of standards and assessments, the urban district in this study implemented coaching <b>for</b> <b>academic</b> <b>leaders</b> who were selected {{to participate in the}} coaching intervention as job- embedded professional development. The district assigned a cadre of trained coach leaders to building principals with the primary goal of coaching <b>academic</b> <b>leaders</b> to attain desired goals. The district 2 ̆ 7 s director of professional development was a certified coach leader and had the responsibility of screening applications from principals and assigning coaches. The data collection process for this study included in-depth interviews, direct observations, and review of archival documents. Holistic analysis captured recurring themes and assertions. Essentials of participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of coaching were collected through semi-structured interviews, analysis of textual content, coding, and categorizing by themes. The significant themes showed the perceptions of coaching as: (1) Supportive Environment, (2) Relationship Built on Trust, (3) Confidential Conversations, (4) Leadership Support, (5) Significance of Reflection, (6) Benefits of Coaching Language in Communication, (7) Co-Constructor, (8) Thinking Partner, and (9) Trust. Executive coaches in this study offered urban leaders a unique opportunity to engage in confidential conversations, solution focused planning with a thinking partner, facilitative conversations using effective questioning, and leadership support for accomplishing predetermined organizational goals. Findings from the study indicated that leadership is a lonely place and in many cases there is no one for the leader to confide in on issues that impact the overall success of the organization. Leadership coaching helps fill this void. The executive coaches establish trusting relationships with leaders which fosters open dialogue and genuine conversations to get {{at the heart of the}} matter. Leaders are better equipped to accomplish goals and model effective strategies after participating in leadership coaching. Trusting relationships are paramount to the success of executive coaching. The principals in this study spoke their truths regarding the conditions and support necessary to lead effective schools.

Key predictors for faculty having considered leaving academe altogether were being in a “hard-applied ” discipline, not having a spouse or partner, a perceived lack of support, a perceived lack of fit, stress of raising a family, and dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the “faculty job”.

Strategic indicators are metrics which synthesize data to report on the current condition and trajectory of an institution in terms of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pursue its mission.

Using Allison and Zelikow 2 ̆ 7 s rational, organizational, and political decision models as the foundation, {{the purpose of}} this narrative study was to explore decision processes used by a successful community college district in California to understand its success with the State 2 ̆ 7 s mandated institutional planning and budgeting processes. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 10 individuals representing a board of trustees, 3 administrations, 3 academic senates, and a faculty association. Data were inductively coded and then subjected to Ollerenshaw and Creswell 2 ̆ 7 s narrative analysis procedure. All 10 narratives were assigned decision process scores based on Allison and Zelikow 2 ̆ 7 s framework and 6 specific planning and budgeting decision events. Findings indicate that elements from all 3 decision models were routinely used to create synergism of actions leading to a collaborative and strong unity of effort. In addition, favored decision-making processes may have overcome rational choice impediments in the budgeting area. The positive social change implication includes a recommendation to the <b>academic</b> <b>leaders</b> of all 72 California community college districts that they capitalize on the synergistic interactions of decision processes required for successful institutional planning and budgeting.

Reductions in government funding and budgetary constraints are prompting universities {{to reduce the number of}} full-time, tenure-track faculty and rely more heavily on adjunct faculty to meet their demand for instructors. Therefore it is important to determine the distinct needs and satisfaction levels of this faculty group in order to provide appropriate resources and development opportunities for them. This study sought to determine if adjunct faculty job satisfaction levels differ based on adjunct typology (Gappa 2 ̆ 6 Leslie, 1993) or institutional affiliation, and to determine professional development interests of adjunct faculty.
