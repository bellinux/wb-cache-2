40|$|The Editorial Board of the American Society of Civil Engineers Journal of Composites for Construction (Lawrence C. Bank, Editor) {{sponsored}} {{a survey of}} the civil/structural engineering programs around the world on the subject of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, excluding the traditional steel-concrete composite construction and fiber reinforced concrete. This paper summarizes the main results from the survey. During the last decade, considerable focus has been devoted to the use of FRP composites in construction. The main driving force is the need for revitalizing the aging infrastructure with innovative materials and structural systems that last longer and require less maintenance. As the construction industry embraces FRPs in the field, the need for educating civil engineers with background on the subject has become more evident. Despite a significant number of field applications and laboratory research, the survey shows that FRPs have not yet been fully implemented in the engineering curricula, and the classrooms are still lagging behind. To improve this situation, civil engineering and their extension programs must provide sufficient training on unique features of FRPs so that engineers could design or specify them in construction. This survey should be repeated as a <b>gauging</b> <b>tool</b> again {{at the end of this}} decade...|$|E
40|$|The Red List {{can be used}} a <b>gauging</b> <b>tool</b> by {{conservation}}ists {{to assess}} which species require focused conservation attention. Mapping the relative distributions of species, and identification of centers of richness, endemism and threat are a first step towards site-oriented conservation action. We use here a specially developed biodiversity index, based on three weighted sub-components assigned to each species: geographical distribution, Red List status, and sensitivity to habitat change. We test this approach using what is called here the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI) to prioritize sites for conservation action, with special emphasis on species occurrence in three global hotspots in southern Africa. Using a selected set of the 23 top prioritized sites, we compare the DBI's performance {{to that of a}} rarity-complementarity algorithm. As with several other taxa, local endemism levels are highest in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), while richness is highest in the north east, particularly in the stream systems of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (MPA) hotspot. Red Listed Odonata species are also concentrated in the CFR, while richness is highest in the MPA hotspot. Site prioritization using the DBI reveals that CFR sites protect Red Listed taxa rather well, despite the fact that catchments are only partially protected. The DBI demonstrates high levels of redundancy in representing Red Listed species, in other words, the same species are represented in several catchments. The value in the DBI thus lies in maximizing redundancy (i. e. representation) of globally Red Listed species. The rarity-complementarity algorithm represents all species, but without greater emphasis on the rare and threatened (i. e. Red Listed) species. We conclude that the DBI is of great value in selecting biodiversity hotspots, while the algorithm is useful for selecting complementarity hotspots. We identify protection gaps and thus recommend continued searches in centers of endemism and existing reserves, as well as gap areas. These searches will hone Red List assessments and identify priority sites, as well as monitor already-identified sites for changes in quality of habitat. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Through the study, the {{research}} question, "how to embrace culturally heterogeneous voices with the Western approach to educational drama", is explored {{in theory and}} practice. In particular, this question corresponds {{to the needs of}} current educational drama in South Korea, 20 years after the introduction of Western approaches. The answer to {{the research}} question is therefore sought in discovering a particular way of Korean educational drama practice which can accommodate Korean cultural sensibilities with the Western way of educational drama. From the literature review, it is found that if any educational drama programme intends to involve educational drama seeking some features of the West and culturally different aesthetic and artistic feelings, they should be handled separately. In addition, the separate implementation of culturally different aesthetic and artistic concepts brings out some effects in terms of identity. Students become conscious and critical of their identities and accordingly their identities become multiple. Going further, they are open to new dimensions of the self. In this sense, a particular way of Korean educational drama practice is theoretically identified in which Sadari dramatic play involving socially critical perception and Haemaru dramatic play embodying kil hung/ shinmyoung p'uri are included and conducted separately. In order to make the theoretically constructed programme more workable in practice, the study carries out action research in the real classroom, identifying problems, challenges and strategies. The outcome of the action research demonstrates that such theoretically identified findings are realizable in real practice but some suggestions are made to bring out such features better. Firstly, for educational drama like Sadari dramatic play, which pursues socially and culturally conscious and critical awareness through emotional engagement, it is useful for teachers to have a <b>gauging</b> <b>tool</b> to measure how much emotional involvement is made and how much critical detachment and cognitive awareness is developed; then, problems and strategies to resolve the problems can be identified. Since Bundy's model used in this research as the measuring tool lacks detailed explanation of the process to link emotional engagement to critical reflection, this study therefore proposes that a model with a more articulate explanation of the process can be tried in the future. Secondly, for the culturally different artistic feeling like the kif ht 1 ng/ shinmyoung p'uri of Haemaru dramatic play, the awareness of new artistic feeling requires three stages: engagement with the given artistic media; grasp of the feeling and cognitive understanding of the artistic feeling. Therefore, if any problem arises, it can be examined with regard to these three stages. Thirdly, the emergence of critical reflection of the self through encountering culturally diverse dramatic languages does not occur without accompanying emotional conflicts such as fear, excitement and anger. The teacher's intervention to bring out critical reflection can be impossible unless students demonstrate affective responses. Fourthly, if educational drama practice attempts to bring out openness to new dimensions of the self by confronting culturally diverse dramatic languages, this study suggests having an experimental stage to provide the opportunity to view and to experiment with given dramatic languages differently and to observe the process of creation. Since this strategy is not actually applied in this research and only identifies the potential, this study proposes that this can be tried in the future...|$|E

In the fifth chapter, we will abandon the descriptive approach in favour of analytical elements and attempt to determine factors justifying diversification. This approach will be reflected upon in detail in the sixth chapter where we will focus our attention on the relation between diversification and economic growth. Finally, in the last chapter we will look into formulating economic policy recommendations for African countries in the area of diversification. ...|$|R
