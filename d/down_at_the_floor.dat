2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E

6000|$|I {{saw that}} we had {{reached the end of}} our rope. Below all was quiet--not a man remained. A door opened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the narrow hull, and {{presently}} Nobs came trotting up to me. He licked my face and rolled over on his back, reaching for me with his big, awkward paws. Then other footsteps sounded, approaching me. I knew whose they were, and I looked straight <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooring.</b> <b>The</b> girl was coming almost at a run--she was at my side immediately. [...] "Here!" [...] she cried. [...] "Quick!" [...] And she slipped something into my hand. It was a key--the key to my irons. At my side she also laid a pistol, and then she went on into the centrale. As she passed me, I saw that she carried another pistol for herself. It did not take me long to liberate myself, and then I was at her side. [...] "How can I thank you?" [...] I started; but she shut me up with a word.|$|R

5000|$|Immediately {{below the}} church lies the upper Geisingen castle or Kniestedt castle first {{mentioned}} {{near the end}} of the 16th century and rebuilt in 1723. Still a further 200 m further <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>floor,</b> lies <b>the</b> lower castle, the ancestral seat of the von Stammheim noble family, a former moated castle from 1486. The buildings as seen today, however, are all much younger; some have only been rebuilt in the 20th century modelled on their predecessor buildings on their former place. An extension building of the moated castle is the so-called [...] "Schlössle" [...] ("little castle" [...] in the Swabian dialect), dated 1671. Further buildings from the 17th century within the farmyard of the lower castle are the old oil mill and the former wine press house.|$|R

Masahiko then goes back to remembering helping a man who had stopped a mugger from stealing his briefcase, and how he introduces the man to a mother and young daughter who own a small pharmacy he had just met. Back in the present, Masahiko looks <b>down</b> sadly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and asks Doraemon to [...] "take me to three days ago". It is then we learn that the man he had introduced is actually a con man who he unknowingly helped by recommending him to the mother and daughter. Now they will lose their shop tomorrow and the daughter, who he secretly loves, will never look at him again.|$|R

50|$|The 150 ft {{focal length}} solar tower {{expanded}} on the solar tower design with its tower-in-a-tower design. (The tower is actually 176 ft tall.) An inner tower supports the optics above, while an outer tower, which completely surrounds the inner tower, supports <b>the</b> dome and <b>floors</b> around <b>the</b> optics. This design allowed complete {{isolation of the}} optics from the effect of wind swaying the tower. Two mirrors feed sunlight to a 12 in lens which focuses light <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor.</b> It was first completed in 1910, but unsatisfactory optics caused a two-year delay before a suitable doublet lens was installed. Research included solar rotation, sunspot polarities, daily sunspot drawings, and many magnetic field studies. The solar telescope would be the world's largest for 50 years until the McMath-Pierce Solar telescope was completed at Kitt Peak in Arizona in 1962. In 1985, UCLA took over operation of the solar tower from the Carnegie Observatories after {{it was decided to}} stop funding the observatory.|$|R
2500|$|Wall Street {{is a major}} {{location}} of tourism in New York City. One report described lower Manhattan as [...] "swarming with camera-carrying tourists". Tour guides highlight places such as Trinity Church, the Federal Reserve gold vaults 80 feet below street level (worth $100 billion), and the NYSE. A Scoundrels of Wall Street Tour is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers [...] "who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them". Occasionally artists make impromptu performances; for example, in 2010, a troupe of 22 dancers [...] "contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks and crannies of the Financial District in Bodies in Urban Spaces" [...] choreographed by Willi Donner. One chief attraction, the Federal Reserve Building in lower Manhattan, paid $750,000 to open a visitors' gallery in 1997. The New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange also spent money in the late 1990s to upgrade facilities for visitors. Attractions include the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve and that [...] "staring <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trading <b>floor</b> was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty".|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The chin down posture is a {{compensatory}} strategy {{commonly used}} {{to minimize the risk}} of aspiration in patients with a pharyngeal delay. There are several difficulties to determining if the chin down posture is effective at eliminating aspiration including: the variability on how to perform the posture, what the posture is called, and the anatomical changes resulting from the posture The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the anatomical changes associated with different postural positions (i. e., chin down, chin tuck, and head extended) using endoscopy. Method: Twenty healthy female subjects underwent nasoendoscopy and assumed four different head positions with and without a bolus in the oral cavity. Subjects were instructed on how to perform each posture prior to insertion of the endoscope. The four head position included a neutral, chin <b>down</b> (looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor),</b> chin tuck (chin to neck), and head extended position. Still images of each posture and condition were analyzed using ImageJ to measure the changes in area of airway opening and in distance between structures (e. g., posterior pharyngeal wall to epiglottis). Measured distances and area changes across postures were analyzed within and across subjects. Statistical and descriptive analyses were also completed. Results 2 ̆ 6 Conclusions: The findings demonstrated that there are statistically significant differences in the anatomical structures of the pharynx when creating the chin down, chin tuck, and head extended positions. Furthermore, the presence of a small liquid bolus in the oral cavity played a significant role in changing the area observed in all postures compared to the non-bolus hold postures. Although we were unable to determine a significant statistical difference between the chin down and chin tuck postures, descriptive analyses of these postures lead to noticeable trends in airway opening and visible anatomy (e. g., laryngeal vestibule, vallecular space) across subjects. The chin tuck posture was found to provide subjects with the greatest decrease in area of airway opening from the neutral position, thus increasing airway protection...|$|R
