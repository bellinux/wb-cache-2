40|$|The {{implementation}} of a conservation program since the early 1980 s resulted in a reduction in phosphorus concentrations in Lake Geneva. However, in the 1990 s, phytoplankton biomass increased again, almost reaching the high values recorded {{during the period of}} greatest P loading. The structural changes in the phytoplankton of Lake Geneva over the past 25 yr have been analyzed using a recently developed statistical method based on hierarchical clustering and Bayesian probabilities. This method has been used to identify phytoplankton assemblages and to map annual and interannual successional patterns simultaneously. Characteristic species were identified for each cluster after calculation of their relative species fidelity and specificity indices. Six distinct phytoplankton assemblages were identified, and although the way species are organized into communities remains unclear, the seasonal patterns of succession are consistent with the C-S-R adaptive strategies and are characteristic of temperate lakes. This pattern broadly recurred over the years, but was markedly influenced by both human activity and regional climatic changes: The warmer winters and springs recorded in Europe since 1988 led to an earlier clear-water phase.

40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} and waste is {{promising}} {{for reducing the}} use of fossil fuels. While the operation conditions of superheaters and gas coolers in the gasifier are restricted by gas-side corrosion, scientific investigations are very scarce in this field. The corrosion of stainless steel (304 L) and low-alloy steel (T 22) in the 2 MW Chalmers gasifier was investigated. To understand corrosion in the real gasifier, simplified laboratory experiments were performed, focussing {{on the effect of}} H 2 and H 2 O on different high temperature alloys. While 304 L stainless steel showed protective behaviour in dry O 2 at 600 ˚C due to formation of a slow-growing (FexCr 1 -x) 2 O 3 oxide, it suffered rapid oxidation in H 2 + H 2 O + Ar environment at the same temperature. It is argued that “breakaway” oxidation was triggered by a <b>deep</b> chromium <b>depletion</b> of the alloy substrate. The chromium <b>depletion</b> was <b>deeper</b> in H 2 -H 2 O environment than it is in, e. g. dry O 2 because the pure chromia scale formed in H 2 -H 2 O environment grew faster that the (Cr 1 -xFex) 2 O 3 scale formed in air and dry O 2. The ability of stainless steel to resist corrosion at high temperature relies on selective oxidation of chromium to form a slow-growing (FexCr 1 -x) 2 O 3 layer, the protective behaviour being the result of slow transport of ions through the oxide and the availability of chromium in the alloy. It is argued that if the alloy substrate becomes exhausted in chromium, another, faster mode of oxidation starts which is characterized by oxidation of iron to Fe 2 +. The <b>deep</b> chromium <b>depletion</b> of the metal substrate is also accompanied by dissolution of oxygen into the metal and internal oxidation. The latter corresponds to a mixture of nm size FeCr spinel oxide particles and Fe,Ni metal. Compared to 304 L, the highly alloyed stainless steel Sanicro 28 and the FeCrAl alloy Kanthal APMT showed superior performance in H 2 + H 2 O + Ar environment. The corrosion resistance of Sanicro 28 is explained by its high Cr content which precluded a very <b>deep</b> Cr <b>depletion</b> of the alloy. The oxidation behaviour of Kanthal APMT was apparently almost the same in H 2 + H 2 O + Ar environment and in O 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{gate current}} of MOS {{tunneling}} diodes biased at inversion region with different substrate doping is investigated. For p-type substrate (1 – 5 -cm) devices, the tunneling diode {{works in the}} <b>deep</b> <b>depletion</b> region and the inversion current {{is dominated by the}} thermal generation rate of minority electrons via traps at Si/SiOP interface and in the <b>deep</b> <b>depletion</b> region. The activation energy is approximately equal to half of the silicon bandgap independent of gate voltage. For devices on p C substrate (0. 01 – 0. 05 -cm), the band-to-traps tunneling and band-to-band tunneling are the dominating current components at inversion bias, and reveal a strong field dependence and a weak temperature dependence.

Electric field measurements {{were made by the}} Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI), and ionospheric plasma densities were measured by Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP). The data were obtained on 17 June 2008, a period of solar minimum conditions. <b>Deep</b> <b>depletions</b> in the equatorial plasma density were observed just before sunrise on three orbits, for which one of these depletions was accompanied by a very large eastward electric field associated with the density depletion, as previously described by de La Beaujardière et al. (2009), Su et al. (2009) and Burke et al. (2009). The origin of this large eastward field (positive upward/meridional drift), which occurred when that component of the field is usually small and westward, is thought to be due to a large-scale Rayleigh–Taylor process. On three subsequent orbits, however, a distinctly different, second type of relationship between the electric field and plasma density near dawn was observed. Enhancements of the eastward electric field were also detected, one of them peaking around 3 mV m − 1, but they were found to the east (later local time) of pre-dawn density perturbations. These observations represent sunrise enhancements of vertical drifts accompanied by eastward drifts such as those observed by the San Marco satellite (Aggson et al., 1995). Like the San Marco measurements, the enhancements occurred during winter solstice and low solar flux conditions in the Pacific longitude sector.

The payload includes an ion analyzer and a Langmuir probe to study the thermal ionospheric plasma and a wave package that measures 3 components of electric fields in the frequency range from DC to 3 MHz and 3 components of magnetic fields from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. Although the main objective of the DEMETER mission is to search for ionospheric effects of seismic activity, the instruments gather data that are also highly relevant to many areas of ionospheric and space weather research. After {{a brief overview of}} the DEMETER satellite and its instruments, we report observations of equatorial plasma depletions that were gathered in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere on two satellite passes during the initial phase of a major magnetic storm on November 10, 2004. <b>Deep</b> plasma <b>depletions</b> of nearly 3 orders of magnitude were observed on both passes with an extension of more than 2000 km along the satellite orbit. Either the satellite travelled within an elongated, depleted "spread-F" flux-tube over nearly 20 ° latitude, or the F-peak had risen well above DEMETER's trajectory at 710 km. Within the region of very low density plasma, the most striking observations are the presence of intense plasma waves at the lower hybrid (LH) frequency near 1. 2 kHz as well as ELF emissions near 280 Hz that is well below the hydrogen cyclotron frequency. Emissions near the LH frequency are observed to be triggered by strong upward-propagating whistlers. Enhanced electrostatic turbulence, up to 200 Hz above the LH frequency, lasts for ~ 20 seconds and is followed by a nearly pure sine wave reminiscent of lower hybrid auroral solitons with amplitudes of a few mV/m. The ELF emissions are characterized by a stable, narrow frequency spectrum with a superimposed, irregular ULF amplitude modulation. Detected only inside the <b>deep</b> <b>depletions</b> with a very sharp drop at the edges, such emissions appear as electromagnetic waves generated and efficiently trapped within the plasma depletion. The ion measurements also provide a new view of equatorial plasma depletions. Fe ions were detected with small but measurable densities in the undisturbed plasma outside of the depletion, whereas the presence of NO ions were detected inside the depletion with variable densities that are, on average, a few percent of the O densities detected by the same instrument. This composition is similar to that at altitudes of about 200 km where instabilities may initially lift the low density plasma up, into the upper F-region. Furthermore, inside the depletion, a number of ion energy spectra obtained by the retarding potential analyzer show the existence of suprathermal ions with temperatures ranging from a few eV to ~ 20 eV and densities between 0. 1 % to 1 % of the major ions. Heating of thermal ions by the LH waves may be one mechanism responsible for the observed suprathermal energy distribution...|$|R

The three larger cratons (West Africa, Congo and Kalahari Cratons) are underlain by Sub Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) extending to ≥ 300 km depth {{and having a}} prevailing depleted composition. Three series of spinel peridotite xenoliths from Waw-En-Namus (Libya; LB hereafter), Tafraoute and Bou-Ibalrhatene (Morocco; MOR), Barombi Mbo and Lake Nyos (Cameroon; CA) have been investigated to provide a new knowledge of the mantle beneath North-Western Africa continent. In particular MOR and LB should reflect peri- and meta-cratonic conditions, respectively while CA are from the Cameroon volcanic line whose products outcrop within a polycyclic mobile belt. According to their chemistry, the spinels from CAM and MOR xenoliths are magmatic cumulates while LB are representatives of ambient lithospheric peridotites. From a structural point of view, the CAM and MOR spinels are rather similar having comparable cell edges and oxygen positional parameters. The cation distribution allows the determination of an intracrystalline temperature in the range 560 - 750 °C. Spinels from LB can be divided in two groups with very different oxygen positional parameter and cell edges. The intracrystalline temperature is 680 °C for the second. There is a similarity of Vcell between the CAM, MOR and LBI cpx ( 435 Å 3. According to their REE contents, CAM cpx can be divided in 2 groups (depleted and enriched in LREE compared to CPX-DMM), in MOR there are two, both enriched, but with different behavior of the LREE suggesting evolutions starting from a DMM like composition. LB cpx show 4 groups, all of them being more or less depleted. The OH contents are lowest for the LB cpx (100 - 300 ppm H 2 O), while the CAM samples are intermediate (200 - 400 ppm H 2 O) and the MOR samples show the highest contents (380 - 610 ppm H 2 O). Boron is nearly absent apart from two samples (one olivine and one cpx) from CAM. The xenoliths sampled from a probably juvenile lithosphere {{at the edge of}} the Cameroon and Morocco lithospheric roots apparently have cumulus-like spinels probably crystallized in situ from percolating melts and thus do not represent a real spinel-peridotites facies; on the contrary peridotite mantle xenoliths from Libya exhibit spinels with features compatible with a slow ascent of a mantle plume. The juvenile behaviors shown by CAM and MOR spinels seem also to be reflected by the cpx-HREE patterns showing typical DMM features.

These processes were investigated by determining the abundance of water-extractable solutes in sediment from the ground surface to the water table (~ 2. 8 m) beneath Franklin Lake playa, California. Accumulation of solutes in the sediment is attributed to evaporation of aqueous solutions transported upward from the water table through the capillary fringe to an evaporation font that is currently 20 - 30 cm below the ground surface.
