40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the {{bending fatigue strength}} of precision forged spur gears and to compare the results with those obtained from conventional cut gears, single tooth bending fatigue tests were carried out on both through-hardened and induction-hardened gear teeth.

50|$|Forged {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (forging) a prefabricated rod using a powerful forging press. Several somewhat different forging techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant forging is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the <b>forged</b> <b>blank.</b> A forged magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than cast wheel. The main disadvantage of forged wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of finished wheels, forged wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since forged wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, forged wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The forging process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make forged magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a theoretical and experimental method for atomic structure characterization. The mirage technique has been performed to prospect unknown material structures {{in order to}} diagnose eventual treatment or defect. The use of Gaussian Laser beam made photothermal deflection signal more appropriate to build-up a simple algorithm in order to investigate metal structure frequential response to a modulated heating excitation and thus identify its more probable structure.

40|$|The {{endurance}} life of {{an engine}} crankshaft {{is closely related to}} its fatigue strength, in addition to other material properties and shape parameters. Deep rolling, moreover, enhances the fatigue limit by applying compressive residual stress within the fillet radius area as a major surface hardening technique. The objective {{of this paper is to}} maximize fatigue life of engine through crankshaft design optimization by quantifying fatigue strength for microalloyed steels versus Cr-Mo alloy steel, and to examine the effects of deep rolling load and rolled fillet geometry. Fatigue tests have been made with standard rotary bending test samples from both bar and <b>forged</b> <b>blanks.</b> Rig tests for actual crankshafts have been made to show how the fatigue strength correlates with different sample types. A correlation of stress distribution with bending moment was demonstrated by applying a strain gauging technique on crankshaft specimens. Therefore, an analysis of combined stresses could be made by considering the effect of static residual stress in addition to the applied dynamic bending stress. Optimum conditions for rolling load, fillet geometry and material were identified. Consequently, these results will be adapted to CAE analysis database to enable an optimization of safety factors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The large {{hydrogenated}} {{cylindrical shell}} {{is an important}} part of petrochemical pressure vessels. From the macroscopic aspects, the influence that the surface defects of the large hydrogenated cylindrical shell’s <b>forging</b> <b>blank</b> has on the high efficiency machining was analyzed in the paper firstly. Then, through the chemical point of view, the new chemical components of the shell’s material were known, and the shell’s material physical properties were also dissected. The phenomenon of compatibility between the Co element which is in tool’s material and the siderophile element of the 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo- 0. 25 V steel which is the material of the large hydrogenated cylindrical shell was found. Therefore, the technical performance requirements of the heavy-duty turning tool which is to achieve the goal of high efficiency cutting were put forward. Through researching the chemical and the physical properties of the shell, the new high-efficiency turning tool was designed from the aspects of the tool’s material and the tool’s geometric structure. Finally, the comparative test between the new heavy-duty turning tool which was named XF 8 and the YT 5 tool which was being used in factory was made, and by way of comparing both the service life and the chip-breaking performance of XF 8 with YT 5 ’s, the test results showed that the XF 8 met the requirements of high-efficiency heavy-duty turning, and the feasibility of the tool’s design scheme was further verified...|$|R

40|$|Recently, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{initiated}} {{a program to}} achieve the significant improvement in aviation safety. One of the technical challenges is the design and development of accelerated experiments that mimic critical damage cases encountered in engine components. The Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Group at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is currently addressing the goal concerning propulsion health management {{and the development of}} propulsion system specific technologies intended to detect potential failures prior to catastrophe. For this goal the unique disk spin simulation system was assembled at NASA GRC, which allows testing of rotors with the spinning speeds up to 10 K RPM, and at the elevated temperature environment reaching 540 C (1000 F). It is anticipated that the facility can be employed for detection of Low Cycle Fatigue disk cracking and further High Cycle Fatigue blade vibration. The controlled crack growth studies at room and elevated temperatures can be conducted on the turbine wheels, and various NDE techniques can be integrated and assessed as in-situ damage monitoring tools. Critical rotating parts in advanced gas turbine engines such as turbine disks frequently operate at high temperature and stress for long periods of time. The integrity of these parts must be proven by non-destructive evaluation (NDE) during various machining steps ranging from <b>forging</b> <b>blank</b> to finished shape, and also during the systematic overhaul inspections. Conventional NDE methods, however, have unacceptable limits. Some of these techniques are time-consuming and inconvenient for service aircraft testing. Almost all of these techniques require that the vicinity of the damage is known in advance. These experimental techniques can provide only local information and no indication of the structural strength at a component and/or system level. The shortcomings of currently available NDE methods lead to the requirement of new damage detection techniques that can provide global information on the rotating components/system, and, in addition, they do not require direct human access to the operating system. During this period of research considerable effort was directed towards the further development of experimental facility and development of the vibration-based crack detection methodology for rotating disks and shafts. A collection of papers and reports were written to describe the results of this work. The attached captures that effort and represents the research output during the grant period...|$|R
40|$|The under-drive {{brake piston}} is an {{essential}} part in the automatic transmissions of automobiles. This component is manufactured by <b>forging</b> after <b>blanking</b> from S 55 C plate with a thickness of 6 mm. It is difficult to design the plate forging process using a thick plate approach since there will be limited material flow as well as large press loads. Furthermore, the under-drive brake piston has a complex shape with a right angle step, which often results in die unfill and abrupt increase in press load. To overcome these obstacles, a separate die for filling material sufficiently to the corner of the right angle step is proposed. However, this approach induces an uncontrolled workpiece surface between the dies, resulting in flash. This excess flash degrades the tool life in the final machining after cold forging as well as increases the cycle time to obtain the net-shape of the part. In the current study, we propose an optimum process design using a conventional die shaped with the benefit of finite element analysis. This approach enhanced the process efficiency without sacrificing the dimensional accuracy in the forged part. As the result, the optimum plate forging process was done with a two stage die, which reduce...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of three different}} techniques, designed to improve the bending fatigue life in comparison to conventionally processed gas-carburized 8620 steel, were evaluated with modified Brugger bending fatigue specimens and actual ring and pinion gears. The bending fatigue samples were machined from <b>forged</b> gear <b>blanks</b> from the same lot of material used for the pinion gear tests, and all processing of laboratory samples and gears was done together. Fatigue data were obtained on standard as-carburized parts and after three special processing histories: shot-peening to increase surface residual stresses; double heat treating to refined austenite grain size; and vacuum carburizing to minimize intergranular oxidation. Standard room-temperature S-N curves and endurance limits were obtained with the laboratory samples. The pinions were run {{as part of a}} complete gear set on a laboratory dynamometer and data were obtained at two imposed torque levels. The number of cycles to failure was used to evaluate the effects of processing history. Based on laboratory endurance limits, shown in parentheses, the processing histories ranked as follows: shot-peened (1410 MPa), vacuum carburized (1210 MPa), reheated to refine grain size (1140 MPa), and as-gas-carburized (1000 MPa). In the gear set tests, shot peening also proved to be {{the most effective way to}} improve fatigue life at both imposed torque levels.

40|$|A plate forging of a drawn {{cup with}} a flange {{including}} thickening of corners {{was developed to}} improve the stiffness of the cup. In a 3 -stage stamping process, the bottom and flange corners of the cup with a flange were thickened by the plate <b>forging.</b> A circular <b>blank</b> was drawn with conical punches in the 1 st and 2 nd stages. In the 3 rd stage, the bottom and flange corners were thickened by flattening the conical bottom of the cup with a flange. Both the bottom and flange corners of the cup were thickened by compressing the flange corner {{in the latter half}} of the 3 rd stage. The amounts of thickening at both corners were improved by modification of intermediate shape. The thickening was concentrated around the two corners by preventing the thickening of the inclined portion. A wheel disk was formed by 6 -stage stamping having the following three stages. The disk had 15 % and 10 % thickening at the bottom and flange corners, respectively, and the bending stiffness of the disk was increased. It was found that the proposed plate forging of sheet metal was considerably effective in increasing in the stiffness and reducing in the weight of automobile parts...|$|R
40|$|Gears are {{components}} in mechanical assemblies used for transmitting power and motion. Gear form cutting (broaching, milling) and gear generating (shaping and hobbing) {{are two of}} the main gear manufacturing methods. Usually production involves three stages: (i) soft machining, (ii) heat treatment, and (iii) hard machining. Limitations introduced by conventional methods can be listed as follows: - In machining difficult to cut materials, high cost of specialized cutting tools, high cutting tool failures is a major issue and high cost of machine tools. - Stresses generated due to heat (thermal stresses) and cutting force affect the component life and cost. This demands alternative ways of material removal without affecting the mechanical properties while delivering right quality in a cost effective way which is the goal of the industry. - Increasing standards on environmental impacts associated with products force the modern manufacturing industry to take critical approach on making processes environmental friendly. Large volume of material is removed during conventional gear production resulting in higher lead time, more use of cutting fluids (and its disposal), chip handling (and its disposal) and dust. In this context, abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting {{is considered to be a}} good addition to the current production system due to the low amount of applied force, negligible heat generated during machining, minimal change in material properties, versatility, lower initial investment and environmental friendliness (no chip generation and no need for cutting fluids). To demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in manufacturing spur gears and helical gears, <b>forged</b> gear <b>blanks</b> typically used on automobile industry were used for initial tests and two gears were produced using 3 -axis KimTech and 5 -axis FineCut precision AWJ machine tools. Individual teeth have been separated from each gear and tested against each other from different perspectives. The metrological, surface integrity, productivity and production cost comparisons were presented. While improvements were achieved from environment and surface integrity perspectives, AWJ cutting cannot replace soft machining stage due to increased lead time and production cost. Novel hybrid gear manufacturing method was proposed from the experiences from this research and compared against the conventional method employed in the automotive industry. Proposed hybrid approach comprises AWJ cutting process as the major material removal method and conventional 5 -axis machining for final finishing or maintenance of tight tolerances and at the same time, decreasing initial investment and adding further flexibility to production system.
