5000|$|In the 1820s, {{immigrant}} Welsh miners brought {{tales of}} the knockers and their theft of unwatched items and warning knocks to western Pennsylvania, when they gravitated there {{to work in the}} mines. Cornish miners, much sought after in the years following the gold and silver rushes, brought them to California and Nevada. When asked if they had relatives who would come to work the mines, the Cornish miners always said {{something along the lines of}} [...] "Well, me cousin Jack over in Cornwall wouldst come, could ye pay ’is boat ride", and so came to be called Cousin Jacks. [...] The Cousin Jacks, as notorious for losing tools as they were for <b>diving</b> out of <b>shafts</b> just before they collapsed, attributed this to their diminutive friends and refused to enter new mines until assured by the management that the knockers were already on duty. Even non-Cornish miners, who worked deep in the earth where the noisy support timbers creaked and groaned, came to believe in the Tommyknockers. The American interpretation of knockers seemed to be more ghostly than elvish.|$|R
