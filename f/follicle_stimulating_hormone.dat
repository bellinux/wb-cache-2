5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing {{for the better part of}} a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (<b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Previous studies {{reported}} that the improvement of endogenous estrogen and progesterone secretions during gestation improved fetal prenatal growth, birth weight, mammary gland growth and development, milk production, litter size, pre- and post-weaning growths. An experiment was conducted to apply the improvement of endogenous secretion of pregnant hormones during pregnancy to increase goat productivity. Thirty-six female ettawah-cross does were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (control: 18 does) included does without improvement of endogenous secretion of pregnant hormones and Group 2 (treatment: 18 does) included does with improvement of endogenous secretion of pregnant <b>hormones</b> using <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> to <b>stimulate</b> super ovulation.

40|$|Life history theory {{predicts that}} {{increasing}} investments into reproduction compromises survival and future reproduction. However, demonstrating such costs is confounded by positive correlations between life history traits. For example, individuals {{in good condition}} may be good at both surviving and reproducing. We studied such processes in a viviparous snow skink lizard (Niveoscincus microlepidotus) from high elevation sites in Tasmania, Australia. Our results show a stark difference in costs of reproduction between unmanipulated females from the natural population versus experimentally manipulated females (using <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones).</b> In the unmanipulated females, females with relatively larger reproductive investments survived better than females with smaller reproductive investments. In the experimental group, however, females forced to ‘over-invest’ into a larger clutch survived less well than controls. Thus, our study confirms the potential dangers of non-experimental estimation of costs of reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Many hormones are {{secreted}} in pulses. The pulsatile {{relationship between}} hormones regulates many biological processes. To understand endocrine system regulation, time series of hormone concentrations are collected. The {{goal is to}} characterize pulsatile patterns and associations between hormones. Currently each hormone on each subject is fitted univariately. This leads to {{estimates of the number}} of pulses and estimates of the amount of hormone secreted; however, when the signal-to-noise ratio is small, pulse detection and parameter estimation remains di±cult with existing approaches. In this paper, we present a bivariate deconvolution model of pulsatile hormone data focusing on incorporating pulsatile associations. Through simulation, we exhibit that using the underlying pulsatile association between two hormones improves the estimation of the number of pulses and the other parameters de¯ning each hormone.

25|$|Hormonal {{control of}} {{spermatogenesis}} varies among species. In humans the mechanism {{is not completely}} understood; however {{it is known that}} initiation of spermatogenesis occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and Leydig cells. If the pituitary gland is removed, spermatogenesis can still be initiated by <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (FSH) and testosterone. In contrast to FSH, LH appears to have little role in spermatogenesis outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero. The physiology is primarily androgenic, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature androgenic alopecia tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, androgen, LH and <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (FSH) {{production}} {{increase and}} the sex cords hollow out, forming the seminiferous tubules, and the germ cells start to differentiate into sperm. Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli {{cells in the}} testes to support sperm production. Exogenous androgen supplements {{can be used as}} a male contraceptive. Elevated androgen levels caused by use of androgen supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to androgen production by Leydig cells, the seminiferous tubules can degenerate, resulting in infertility. For this reason, many transdermal androgen patches are applied to the scrotum.|$|E

25|$|Currently, all PGD embryos are {{obtained}} by assisted reproductive technology, although {{the use of}} natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted {{in the past and}} is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient’s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600µg of natural micronized progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{collection}} is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located {{inside of the}} body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used {{in order to have}} a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads. <b>Follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization. In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less. Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female. Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos. It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{means of}} {{assessing}} reproductive status in rodents is useful {{not only in}} the study of reproductive dysfunction but is also required for the production of new mouse models of disease and investigations into the hormonal regulation of tissue degeneration (or regeneration) following pathological challenge. The murine reproductive (or estrous) cycle is divided into 4 stages: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Defined fluctuations in circulating levels of the ovarian steroids 17 -β-estradiol and progesterone, the gonadotropins luteinizing and <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones,</b> and the luteotropic hormone prolactin signal transition through these reproductive stages. Changes in cell typology within the murine vaginal canal reflect these underlying endocrine events. Daily assessment of the relative ratio of nucleated epithelial cells, cornified squamous epithelial cells, and leukocytes present in vaginal smears can be used to identify murine estrous stages. The degree of invasiveness, however, employed in collecting these samples can alter reproductive status and elicit an inflammatory response that can confound cytological assessment of smears. Here, we describe a simple, non-invasive protocol {{that can be used to}} determine the stage of the estrous cycle of a female mouse without altering her reproductive cycle. We detail how to differentiate between the four stages of the estrous cycle by collection and analysis of predominant cell typology in vaginal smears and we show how these changes can be interpreted with respect to endocrine status...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen male {{patients}} with stable chronic obstructive airways disease were separated {{into two groups}} of eight according to arterial carbon dioxide tensions. Hypercapnia was associated with lower arterial oxygen tensions, higher red cell volume, and increased weight, while normocapnic subjects were decidedly thin. The considerable difference in body weight {{between the two groups}} could not be explained by variation in caloric intake, and malabsorption was excluded as a cause of weight loss in the underweight subjects. Serum tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, cortisol, and oestradiol concentrations were similar and normal in each group, but both groups had significantly low testosterone values as compared with controls, values in the hypercapnic being appreciably lower than in the normocapnic group. The adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone was significantly high in the normocapnic group and low in the hypercapnic group compared with controls. Serum pituitary luteinising and <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> were normal, but three hypercapnic individuals had high serum prolactin values. Early morning urinary aldosterone values were significantly higher in the hypercapnic than in the normocapnic group. Such hormone comparisons have not previously been made in subjects with chronic obstructive airways disease grouped according to arterial blood gas values, and it is concluded that major alterations in adrenal and testicular function may occur, possibly due to pituitary suppression from hypoxia.

Group I, which served as the control received 0. 2 ml/kg normal saline, Group II and III received 0. 5 mg/kg (low dose) and 1. 0 mg/kg (high dose) body weight {{of nicotine}}, respectively. The fourth and fifth groups were gavaged with 0. 5 mg/kg and 1. 0 mg/kg body weight of nicotine but were left untreated for another 30 days. These groups served as the recovery groups. Serum was analyzed for testosterone, luteinizing <b>hormone</b> (LH), <b>follicle</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> (FSH), and prolactin using radioimmunoassay. Results: Results showed that nicotine administration significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) testosterone in the low and high treated groups and FSH in the high dose treated group when compared with the control group. There was a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in mean LH and prolactin level in the high dose treated group when compared with the control. However, the values of the recovery groups were comparable with the control.
