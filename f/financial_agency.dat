40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF) samples from 65 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated {{according to two}} different treatment protocols (GBTLI-ALL- 93 and - 99) with no puncture accident for minimal residual disease (MRD) in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Minimal residual disease was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with homo/heteroduplex analysis using consensus primers to IgH and TCR genes. MRD in the CSF at diagnosis was detected by PCR in 46. 8 % of children with no puncture accident or morphological involvement. In patients treated with GBTLI-ALL- 93 a significantly lower 5 -year event-free survival (EFS) was demonstrated for those with CSF involvement, in univariate (p = 0. 01) and multivariate (p = 0. 04) analysis. This observation was not true for patients treated with the more intensive protocol GBTLI-ALL- 99 (p = 0. 81). These findings suggest that MRD detection in the CSF is a common event in children with ALL. Treatment intensification provided by the GBTLI-ALL- 99 apparently overcomes the detrimental effect of CNS minimal residual disease at diagnosis.
