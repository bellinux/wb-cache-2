5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the <b>emotional</b> <b>shock</b> he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E

The story is clear from the diary Huxley kept: p112 'little interest in the Barrier Reef'; p116 'two entries in seven weeks'; p117 '3 months passed and no journal' p124 'the black months of struggle and depression'. For him to pass up such a golden opportunity speaks of his state of mind.|$|E

[...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E

Research on such impacts has almost exclusively {{been confined to}} the medical field, and focused on severe conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The fact that <b>emotional</b> <b>shocks</b> and increased risk awareness may trigger changes in the preferences and behavior of economic agents has until now largely been ignored, including by economists. Based on panel datasets from China’s Sichuan province, which was struck by an earthquake in 2008, and using distance from epicenter {{as a proxy for}} earthquake severity, we empirically show that the saving and consumption behavior of households closer to the epicenter changed after the earthquake. They saved less, spent more lavishly on alcohol and cigarettes, and also played majiang (a Chinese game) more often. The magnitude of the estimated impact on saving behavior, a drop of 6 percentage points for each degree of earthquake intensity, is economically significant. It appears that the earthquake has induced a shift in people’s preferences characterized by a carpe diem attitude toward spending and greater preference for the present.

40|$|Restricted until 16 Dec. 2010. Heart {{dynamics}} {{and heart rate}} variability, {{as well as their}} characterization, have been of interest to researchers for years. Sudden death due to heart failure, which could be the result of heart diseases, drug consumptions, or even <b>emotional</b> <b>shocks,</b> {{is one of the most}} important issues in public health. Henceforth, prediction and/or awareness of such conditions has always been a top priority. In the present work, a time domain approach, as opposed to the traditional frequency-domain approach, to heart rate dynamics is introduced. The Electro-Cardio-Gram (ECG) signals, more specifically the RR and QT intervals as characteristics of heart dynamics, are investigated. It is hypothesized that the Erlang distribution of the RR interval is a manifestation of the Poincaré return time phenomenon, and based on clinical results available to us, it is conjectured that for the healthy heart, it is necessary but not sufficient that the RR interval would be the k-fold Poincaré return time. The higher frequency, k times that of normal heartbeat, is hypothesized to be related to the synchronization of the array of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node. In this work, chaotic behavior of heart dynamics is observed by means of such nonlinear techniques such as calculation of Lyapunov exponents, Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy, and Kaplan-Yorke (K-Y) dimensions. These techniques measure chaos, the amount of uncertainty and complexity of the system, respectively. The existence of positive Lyapunov exponent and non-integer K-Y dimension in the heart rate confirms its chaotic dynamics. Heart dynamics is also analyzed via statistical techniques such as linear and nonlinear canonical correlation analyses and mutual KS information. These techniques are implemented to unravel the at point subtle relationship between RR and QT intervals.; It is conjectured that past RR intervals are nonlinear regression variables on the future QT intervals for the healthy heart, and in case of any abnormalities, such as prolongation of QT interval, the cause to effect relationship from past RR to future QT might be compromised...|$|R

40|$|Nominal {{literature}} exists {{concerning the}} experiences of parents bereaved by suicide. The sudden and unexpected loss of a family member to suicide is an overwhelming occurrence for peoples of various different ethnic and cultural milieus. An invitation {{to participate in a}} free format study where participants could freely tell their stories was distributed in the Waikato Region, North Island, New Zealand, through community liaisons and public health coordinators. Participation was absolutely voluntary and the emphasis was on telling stories rather than being questioned. In this pilot study nine stories were recorded from seven families: a sibling, a grandparent, and five mums. The tool for collecting stories was free format story collection guided by several themes including coping processes, formal and informal support processes. The story or talking (korero) sessions were interviewer administered. It was anticipated that the respondents will include a large proportion of Maori. For this reason the interviewer was of Maori descent, Maori speaking and well versed with Maori culture. The story sessions were transcribed. The transcribed stories were subjected to textual analysis by two researchers. For this analysis the researchers looked for patterns of statements indicating beliefs or underscoring of a known, e. g. anger, or a new phenomenon. The results were compared for agreement/diagreement. Any inconsistencies between the researchers’ findings were subjected to further analysis until a consensus was reached. However, the latter situation did not arise.

40|$|Modern {{medicine}} has recognized that chronic diseases cannot {{and should not}} be treated and managed like acute disorders. Acute disorders such as bacterial infections, broken bones and even <b>emotional</b> trauma from <b>shock</b> or injury, can typically be traced to a clearly identifiable source (e. g., an infectious agent, physical trauma) and can be “cured ” through treatment and recovery processes that span {{a relatively short period of}} time. The onset, course and resolution of acute disorders may be intense and disruptive, but they generally leave no lasting mark on one’s identity or functional capabilities. The treatment process essentially returns the body to its original state- the treated individual is no more (or less) susceptible to a return of the disease or condition than an individual who never had the disease. Thus, while a treated individual may again break a bone or get another infection- this is considered a new occurrence and not a relapse. In contrast, chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma or heart disease spring from and are complicated by, multiple biological, psychological and social factors- some of which cannot be clearly identified. Many times “lifestyle ” or personal behavioral choices are intimately involved in the onset and course of these disorders. While there are usually several potentially effective treatments for chronic disorders, they are of necessity more complex and protracted than acute treatments and they do not produce the same kinds of outcomes as acute treatments. All chronic treatments, regardless of disease, share three important features. First, they can usually remove or reduce the symptoms of the disease- but cannot affect the root causes of the disease. For example, beta blockers reduce blood pressure and insulin improves the body’s ability to digest sugars and starches- as long as the affected individual continues the treatment. However, these treatments do not return the affected individual to normal. The second feature associated with all chronic treatments is that they require significant changes in lifestyle and behavior on the part of the patien...|$|R
40|$|The {{closure of}} large {{psychiatric}} institutions and thesteady decline in funding for community services hasforced family caregivers, particularly women, to shoulder increasing {{responsibility for the}} care of relatives who experience mental illness. Families are now the lifeline for many people who experience mental illness. Studies show that as many as 75 % of individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals after an episode of illness return home to live with their families. In the case of individuals who do not reside with their families, as many as 90 % stay in regular contact (Lehman & Steinwaches, 1998; Skinner, Steinwaches, & Kasper, 1992; Lefley, 2000). A substantial body of research documents the stress experienced by caregivers as a consequence of caring for their mentally ill relatives. As early as 1966, Hoenig and Hamilton made an important contribution to this research by identifying two types of stress associated with caregiv-ing—subjective burden and objective burden (1966). Subjective burden refers to “the individual’s personal appraisal of the caregiving situation and is associated with the <b>emotional</b> reactions of <b>shock,</b> grief, anxiety, anger, worry, guilt and fear resulting from mental illness in a rel-ative ” (Schene, 1990; Marsh, 1998). Objective burden is defined as “observable concrete costs to the family resulting from mental illness ” (Maurin & Boyd, 1990) and includes, among other things, disruption to the household, financial difficulties, and impact on marital and other familial rela-tionships (Hatfield, 1997). In the current context of com-munity-based care, the stress associated with caregiving is often exacerbated because of brief inpatient treatment, poor follow-up care, and lack of support services. Research on the impact of caregiving stress on family members and their needs for support is relatively of recent origin (Lefley, 1997). There have been several barriers to investigating these areas. Research during the 1940 s to the 1960 s viewed the family as causing mental illness and resulted in family carers feeling blamed and criticized by treatment professionals for their caregiving role (Lefley, 1997). The Expressed Emotion (EE) studies by Leff and Vaughn (1985) absolved families of being causative in th...|$|R
