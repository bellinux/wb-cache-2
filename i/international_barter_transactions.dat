The multiple exchange rate regime that existed in Russia prior to July 3, 1992, created strong incentives for exporters to refrain from repatriating foreign exchange earnings, induced both importers and exporters to participate in unofficial markets for foreign exchange, and encouraged <b>international</b> <b>barter</b> <b>transactions.</b> Efforts to manage the exchange rate through heavy foreign exchange intervention were unsuccessful. The July 3, 1992, unification of the multiple exchange rate system provides important and general lessons for rectifying undesirable conditions caused by poorly implemented exchange rate policy. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{theoretically}} analyze {{the relationship between}} <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> and reproduction of the economy, taking into account causes of barter operations in Russia: liquidity constraint and tax evasion. This paper suggests that when firms are suffering liquidity constraint, price ratios both for currency settlement and barter exchanges are required and commodities are non-equivalently bartered. Furthermore, when firms barter in order to evade taxes, and bilateral and multilateral <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> are combined, in some cases firms in deficit become firms in surplus, making the economy reproducible...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} model is developed {{to examine the}} determinants of the growing level of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> in the US. Although a barter system {{is believed to be}} Pareto inferior to a money system, recent statistics of the estimated level of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> in the US show a rapidly growing interest by large corporations as well as individuals in this type of trade. The primary obstacle in empirical research in this area is the difficulty of measuring the size of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions.</b> Here, data from barter exchange organizations are used to test the significance of several variables. The Ordinary Least Squares, and Cointegration and Error Correction Models are employed as two alternative empirical techniques to analyse the data. The results support the counter-cyclical arguments as well as the inflation factor. However, the notion of tax evasion as a motive in organized barter receives only a partial support. ...|$|R

Here, we correct the arbitrary replacement of the missing observations by filling them with forecasts using the Box-Jenkins ARMA and Kalman filter methods before performing the unit root and cointegration tests. Although the ECM estimates for various measures of business cycle are occasionally inconsistent, overall the inventory measures and capacity utilization results suggest that <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> are counter-cyclical regardless {{of the size of the}} business. Additionally, we find that barter rises with inflationary trend, dissemination of access to computer technology, tax rates and tax laws requiring disclosure of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|A general {{consensus}} in the transition economies literature links the existence of enterprise restructuring with {{the pace of the}} transition process and the potential for economic growth. The existing literature is less clear, however, about whether the lack of economic growth is caused by the lack of enterprise restructuring. Complicating the debate in Russia is the confusion regarding the role of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> in enterprise restructuring. Much of the confusion is generated by proponents of a "virtual economy" interpretation of how the Russian economy and Russian enterprise managers operate. This paper dispels much of the confusion about the existence of enterprise restructuring and the corresponding role of barter by demonstrating why the virtual economy model fails to accurately depict economic actions or outcomes in Russia. We develop the argument that barter is closely related to an absence of liquidity in the Russian economy, using both macro-level and micro-level data to document the consequences of "structural illiquidity. " Our results are unambiguous: both the incidence and volume of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> are inversely related to liquidity. We conclude that analyses using <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> as evidence of the lack of enterprise restructuring in Russia stem from: (1) the lack of clear consensus about what constitutes enterprise restructuring in transition economies and how it varies with the stage of the transition process; (2) errant assumptions about managers' objective functions; (3) the relative mix of formal and informal restructuring mechanisms; (4) the lack of attention to industry variation and, within industry, to managerial characteristics; and (5) the Texan complex (if it ain't big, it ain't [...] .) which causes analysts to ignore changes in enterprise operations unless they occur on a grandiose scale.

40|$|A <b>barter</b> <b>transaction</b> {{allows for}} two parties to {{exchange}} {{goods or services}} without using money. Direct barter {{is often referred to}} as the “double coincidence of wants ” and requires that each of the two parties involved in the transaction each have a good satisfying a specific need of the other party. This results in high transaction costs, primarily associated with the search to find the “double coincidence ” necessary for a direct <b>barter</b> <b>transaction.</b> There is an additional cost due to the uncertainty of the value of the goods traded. This cost is primary associated with the need for the receiving party to use the traded good or to trade it in another <b>transaction.</b> Indirect <b>barter</b> uses an intermediary good in the exchange, such as a trade token. The prevalence of barter is expected to be limited due to high transaction costs because the time and effort involved in the transactions would be costly. However, the use of barter appears to be increasingly on the rise. A major contributing factor to this growth is the use of existing and emerging electronic commerce technologies, such as search engines and transaction processing systems, that may be used over a global network of hundreds of millions of users.
