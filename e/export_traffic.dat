6000|$|The chief ports were London (Lundenbyrig), {{situated}} {{at the head of}} tidal navigation on the Thames; and Bristol (Bricgestow) and Gloucester (Gleawan-ceaster), similarly placed on the Avon and Severn.

In this study, we demonstrate that di-acidic motifs in the membrane-distal, nonstructural C-terminal portions are required for the exit from the ER and transport to the plasma membrane of angiotensin II receptors, but not adrenergic receptors. More interestingly, distinct di-acidic motifs dictate optimal <b>export</b> <b>trafficking</b> of different angiotensin II receptors and export ability of each acidic residue in the di-acidic motifs cannot be fully substituted by other acidic residue. Moreover, the function of the di-acidic motifs is likely mediated through facilitating the recruitment of the receptors onto the ER-derived COPII transport vesicles. Therefore, the di-acidic motifs located in the membrane-distal C termini may represent the first linear motifs which recruit selective GPCRs onto the COPII vesicles to control their export from the ER...|$|R

During the 16th century, Europe began to outpace the Arab world in the <b>export</b> <b>traffic,</b> with its slave traffic from Africa to the Americas. The Dutch imported slaves from Asia into their colony in South Africa.

40|$|Abstract – Host cell remodelling is a {{hallmark}} of malaria pathogenesis. It involves protein folding, unfolding and trafficking events and thus participation of chaperones such as Hsp 70 s and Hsp 40 s is well speculated. Until recently, only Hsp 40 s {{were thought to be}} the sole representative of the parasite chaperones in the exportome. However, based on the re-annotated Plasmodium falciparum genome sequence, a putative candidate for exported Hsp 70 has been reported, which otherwise was known to be a pseudogene. We raised a specific antiserum against a C-terminal peptide uniquely present in PfHsp 70 -x. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence-based approaches in combination with sub-cellular fractionation by saponin and streptolysin-O have been taken to determine the expression and localization of PfHsp 70 -x in infected erythrocyte. The re-annotated sequence of PfHsp 70 -x reveals it to be a functional protein with an endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide. It gets maximally expressed at the schizont stage of intra-erythrocytic life cycle. Majority of the protein localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole and some of it gets exported to the erythrocyte compartment where it associates with Maurer’s clefts. The identification of an exported parasite Hsp 70 chaperone pre-sents us {{with the fact that the}} parasite has evolved customized chaperones which might be playing crucial roles in as-pects of trafficking and host cell remodelling.
