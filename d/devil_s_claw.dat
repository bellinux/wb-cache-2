If your produce is more suited for export, it is better to team up with others or have others do the promotion for you. The Out of Africa trade exhibition has been travelling through Europe since mid- 2002, promoting Africa s medicinal plants. It has visited such trade fairs as Vitafoods in Geneva, Switzerland in May and the Natural Products Expo Europe in Amsterdam, The Netherlands in June. Out of Africa is built around seven medicinal plants, each representing an African region. The African sausage tree, Kigelia pinnata, for example, is used for treating ulcers and sores and was chosen to represent south-east Africa. The <b>devil</b> <b>s</b> <b>claw,</b> Harpagophytum procumbens, now widely used to treat rheumatism and arthritis, represented south-west Africa. West Africa sent the baobab tree used for skin care as its ambassador, and the island continent of Madagascar sent its periwinkle catharanthus roseus, a source of alkaloids used in treatments against leukaemia and Hodgkins disease. More than a dozen African companies from Côte d Ivoire, Ghana, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan and Tanzania have leaflets, photos, products and plant materials on display on the stand. Out of Africa was designed by the British European Design Group in association with Denzil Phillips International Ltd (www. denzil. com), with support from the Centre for the Development of Enterprise.

40|$|Objectives  Potential {{interactions}} between herbal medicinal products and the cytochrome (CYP) P 450 system {{are an important}} safety concern. We set out to develop a screening panel for assessing such interactions {{and use it to}} evaluate the interaction potential of devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw.</b> Methods  The panel consisted of luminescence-based inhibition assays for CYP 1 A 2, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 D 6 and 3 A 4, and a reporter gene (luciferase) assay for pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation and CYP 3 A 4 induction. Caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid, two compounds with strong fluorescence quenching properties, were used to demonstrate the assay 2 ̆ 7 s resistance to interference. We tested 10 commercial devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw</b> preparations as well as harpagoside and harpagide, two important constituents of devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw.</b> Key findings  Five preparations were found to weakly inhibit CYP 3 A 4 (IC 50 124. 2 – 327. 6 µg/ml) and five were found to weakly activate PXR (EC 50 10. 21 – 169. 3 µg/ml). Harpagoside and harpagide did not inhibit CYP 3 A 4. In agreement with published data, bergamottin, a natural product known to interact with CYP 3 A 4, was shown to inhibit CYP 3 A 4 with an IC 50 of 13. 63 µm and activate PXR with an EC 50 of 6. 7 µm. Conclusions  Devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw</b> preparations are unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on CYP function. The assay panel proved effective in screening devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw</b> preparations, demonstrating its suitability for use with plant extracts.

40|$|Ghrelin is a stomach-derived peptide {{that has}} been {{identified}} as the only circulating hunger hormone that exerts a potent orexigenic effect via activation of its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R 1 a). Hence, the ghrelinergic system represents a promising target to treat obesity and obesity-related diseases. In this study we analysed the GHS-R 1 a receptor activating potential of Harpagophytum procumbens, popularly known as Devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Claw,</b> and its effect on food intake in vivo. H. procumbens is an important traditional medicinal plant from Southern Africa with potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This plant has been also used as an appetite modulator but most evidences are anecdotal and to our knowledge, no clear scientific studies relating to appetite modulation have been done to this date. The ghrelin receptor activation potential of an extract derived from the dried tuberous roots of H. procumbens was analysed by calcium mobilization and receptor internalization assays in human embryonic kidney cells (Hek) stably expressing the GHS-R 1 a receptor. Food intake was investigated in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice following intraperitoneal administration of H. procumbens root extract in ad libitum and food restricted conditions. Exposure to H. procumbens extract demonstrated a significant increased cellular calcium influx but did not induce subsequent GHS-R 1 a receptor internalization, which is a characteristic for full receptor activation. A significant anorexigenic effect was observed in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice following peripheral administration of H. procumbens extract. We conclude that H. procumbens root extract is a potential novel source for potent anti-obesity bioactives. These results reinforce the promising potential of natural bioactives to be developed into functional foods with weight-loss and weight maintenance benefits...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{medicinal}} products (HMPs) {{are used in}} a variety of oral and topical forms for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The aim {{of this study was to}} update a previous systematic review published in 2000. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane registers) to June 2007, unrestricted by date or language, and included randomized controlled trials that compared HMPs with inert (placebo) or active controls in patients with osteoarthritis. Five reviewers contributed to data extraction. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus with reference to Cochrane guidelines and advice from the Cochrane Collaboration. Thirty-five studies (30 studies identified for this review update, and 5 studies included in the original review) evaluating the effectiveness of 22 [*]HMPs were included. However, due to differing HMPs, interventions, comparators, and outcome measures, meta-analysis was restricted to data from studies of three HMPs: topical capsaicin, avocado-soybean unsaponifiables, and the Chinese herbal mixture SKI 306 X showed benefit in the alleviation of osteoarthritic pain. Several studies investigating products from devil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claw,</b> and a powder from rose hip and seed, reported favorable effects on osteoarthritic pain, whereas two studies of a willow bark extract returned disparate results. Three studies of Phytodolor NR were of limited use because doses and measures were inconsistent among trials. The remaining single studies for each HMP provided moderate evidence of effectiveness. No serious side effects were reported with any herbal intervention. Despite some evidence, the effectiveness of none of the HMPs is proven beyond doubt. The obvious potential benefits of HMPs in the treatment of osteoarthritis are reduced reliance on synthetic medications with the associated risks of harmful adverse events, but further clinical trials are necessary before HMPs can be adopted in osteoarthritis treatment guidelines...|$|R
40|$|U relativno skromnu inventanru figuralnih mozaika sačuvanih na području Hrvatske posebno mjesto pripada trima velikim mozaicima u lapidarju Arheološkog muzeja u Splitu. Mozaici s likovima Tritona, Orfeja i Apolona, datirani između 2. i 3. stoljeća, pokazuju neke zanimmljivosti kako u ikonografskom tako i u likovnom pogledu. Nastali na izmaku antike, kao djela provincijalnog stila, tri potireskna lika prikazana u mozaiku sačuvala su izvjesnu nezavisnost inspiracije unutar tradicionalnih formula suvremenih mozaičkih radionica. Njihova usporedba s brojnim suvremenim primjerima iz istog tematskog repertoara, navodi na razmišljanja posebno u pogledu njihove ikonografske interpretacije. Among {{the stone}} monuments from Classical Salona in the {{collection}} of the Split Archaeological Museum there are three large figural mosaics known to the Croatian and partially to the foreign scholars. In the literature they are known as mosaics showing Triton, Apollo and Orpheus. The first mosaic shows a male torso, whose hair is composed of whiplik tendriles of a medusa or polyp. A horn emerges from the forehead, caried out in red tessarea and crab 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claws</b> stick out of his untidy hair on the left and right sides of his head. Crab 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claws</b> and the horn on his head are attributes of Titan Oceanus. the oldest son of Uranus and Gaea, gods of the seas and rivers whose visual presentations have their origin in Hellenistic-Roman art, and are especially common in rnosaics of the third century. Depictions of Oceanus are known from mosaics in Munsingen, Bad Kreuznach, Avenches, Vienne, Lyon, Classical Themetra, Ultique, Carranque and other places. He is mostly shown as an old man with a beard, but out character is closest t the young Oceanus with thick hai and a lively expression as in the mosaic in Munsingen. V von Gonzenbach, who dates this mosaic somewhere between the year 175 and 200, supports the view that the crab 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claws</b> on the head are always the attribute of Occanus. The bull 2 ̆ 7 s horn, sticking out of the forehead of the figure of the Salona mosaic, is another of Oceanus 2 ̆ 7 s attributes. 1) The mosaic of Orpheus shows many analogies as well as special features compared to contemporary examples. The composition scheme, with a central medallien surrounded by four semi-circles and segments of circles in the corners of a rectangle, is common in mosaics from the second and third century. In Croatia it is found at three localities. During the first and second centuries Orpheus is shown in a landscape surrounded by numerous animals, as in mosaics in Italy and Africa. From the end of the second and during the third century the scene and the number of characters was reduced. The natural environment and animals are stylized and are persuing each other. In general, the scene is dramatic. According to some authors there are two sources of these different iconographic interpretations of Orpheus. One originates from the Latin West, while the other represents a 2 ̆ 7 mannerist 2 ̆ 7 group formed according to the tradition of the Greek East. Although the Solin mosaic has many characteristics of the "mannerist" group, to which examples from Paphos, Cos, Sparta, Newton St. Loe and Wittington in England belong, the scene in our mosaic is natural, and the character has qualities of a portrait. The seated figure with his lyre leaning against his knee and a hand brushing over the strings is far from the usual stylized, decorative images of Orpheus with his body in semi-profile and head turned towards the viewer, as in the mosaic in Panik. The clothing with soft folds is formed without graphic effects, using lines of dark tessarea, - typical of late Classical art. The Solin mosaic is between the first and second ("mannerist") group of mosaics showing Orpheus from the third and fourth century. The tradition of earlier mosaics is to coney a Classical feeling for a natural scene, and the later ones are stylized and have lost the feeling for dimension and space. In composition it has similarities with the Cos mosaic, and in reduction of the number of figures to the Newton St. Loe Orpheus from Yvonand in Switzerland (dated between 200 and 225) and from Trier because Orpheus does not wear a Frigian cap, which is usually his essential attribute. Closest to this mosaic is the one from Rottweil, which, according to Parlasca, dates from the end of the second century. III. The mosaic showing Apollo dates from the same period as the previous two because of its central composition, large number of borders and the interpretation of the figure in the central medallion. Stylizing and decorative elements can be seen in the treatment of the border characters, while the central figure of Apollo, treated in an almost impressionist manner, has kept its harmony and classical beauty. lf we try o guess the purpose of the areas in which these mosaics were placed, we think first of spas, frigidariums of nyphaenms, which would probably have been part of a governor`s palace. The three mythical figures are connected by the notion of water (sea). Triton (Occanus) is in his natural environment, Orpheus, the divine musician tames nature and leads the animals to spring, and the third figure Apollo, the protector of sailors and the follower of nymphs (godesses of springs) also fits into this combination. Explaining the purpose of certain arcas according to decoration is one of the "helping" methods in the history of art. lt is common and very often successful when it comes to mosaics...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} Book VI of L Île des pingouins (1908), by Anatole France (1884 - 1924). In the novel, French {{society is}} satirically {{represented by a}} group of penguins metamorphosed into men after having being mistakenly baptized by the old apostle Mael, who mistook the birds for short men. The novel is divided into eight sections called books, in order to make them look like the sacred books. The sixth book is about the Dreyfus Case (1894 - 1906), a case of espionage {{known as one of the}} greatest judicial errors of modern history. Capitan Alfred Dreyfus, accused of having handed in military secrets belonging to the French artillery army to the German army, was arrested and deported to the <b>Devil</b> <b>s</b> Island, where he stayed for five years, until his process was reviewed and the real spy was found out. In L Île des pingouins, the Dreyfus Case is represented in a parodical way by the Pyrot Case, in which a penguin official is unfairly accused of having handed in eighty thousand bales of hay to the porpoise enemy army. Through laughter, the reader realizes the narrator s disenchantment: the presentation of the characters as caricatures, the satire in relation to history and the positive method shows, however, a pessimistic view of the origin of the universe, of mankind and its history. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are: i) to verify how the Dreyfus Case is recovered in Book VI of the novel, whose title is Modern Times - The Case of the Eighty Thousand Bales of Hay, by studying the effects of the usage of parody, hyperbole, and caricature in order to satirize historical figures, social institutions (such as the Church, the army, the government) and even the end of the Case; ii) to analyze the means used by the novelist to give his critical rereading of history an aesthetic feature, by examining how the writer gives literariness to historical facts, transforming them into parts of his novel...|$|R

Both pieces are analysed under the headings form, melody and motives, rhythm, harmonies and violinistic aspects, always connecting to the programmatic content of the titles. Described by the composer as a pre-sketch to Raptus, some similarities with Nelle Mani d’Amduscias are noted. Mythes by Szymanowski provided a source of inspiration for Nelle Mani d’Amduscias and similar compositional techniques are observed. The title Nelle Mani d’Amduscias is musically illustrated with symbolic elements. These include the tritone, or Diabolus in Musica, the use of which was discouraged by religious medieval theorists, the trill, which is reminiscent of the <b>Devil.</b> <b>s</b> Trill Sonata by Tartini, and a difficulty level that is reminiscent of a Paganini Caprice. This further links to rumours surrounding the violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini of being in league with the devil, due to his unprecedented performing brilliance. Medieval elements are also considered. The use of mirror image interval patterns {{and the use of the}} octatonic scale are discussed as themes. The use of the vertical 2 : 3 rhythm, an unusual technique on the solo violin, is noted. Luamerava is analysed in connection with the characteristics of mbira music and African music. African and mbira compositional devices that are noted include call and response, melodic shape, mbira counterpoint and the use of ostinato, hocket, canon, hemiola, additive rhythms and African dancing in the Danzante. The chord sequence of mbira music of the Shona of Zimbabwe is compared to the harmonies used in the Danzante. The performance of the Western tradition is compared to that of the African mbira tradition. A short comparison noting the similarities and differences of the two works is provided in the conclusion.

2500|$|Farren {{began her}} long {{tenure at the}} Gaiety Theatre in December 1868, at the {{re-opening}} of the theatre under new management by John Hollingshead, playing Sprightly in On the Cards and the title role in its companion piece, Robert the <b>Devil,</b> by W. <b>S.</b> Gilbert, a burlesque of the opera Robert le Diable. [...] This ran until May 1869. Her husband, Robert Soutar, joined the theatre {{at the same time}} and served as an actor, stage manager and writer there. Farren next played the title role in Alfred Thompson's Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key (1869).|$|R
50|$|Under the {{management}} of John Hollingshead until 1886, the theatre had early success with Robert the <b>Devil,</b> by W. <b>S.</b> Gilbert, followed by many other burlesques of operas and literary works. Many of the productions starred Nellie Farren. Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque Little Jack Sheppard (1885-86), produced together with his successor, George Edwardes. Edwardes's first show, Dorothy, became a long-running hit. In the 1880s and 90s, the theatre had further success {{with a number of}} burlesques with original scores by the theatre's music director, Wilhelm Meyer Lutz, including Faust up to Date (1888), Carmen up to Data (1890) and Cinder Ellen up too Late (1891).|$|R
50|$|Scapteriscus abbreviatus is a {{medium-sized}} mole cricket with {{a length of}} from 22 to 29 mm. Its leathery forewings are shorter than its prothorax and its membranous hind wings are shorter than its forewings, rendering it unable to fly. Members of this genus are characterized by having two sharp claws and a blade-like process with a sharp edge on their forelegs. Other mole crickets {{have three or four}} <b>claws.</b> <b>S.</b> abbreviatus can be distinguished from the other members of its genus found in Florida, S. borellii and S. vicinus, by examining the two claws on its front leg. They diverge slightly and the distance between them at the base is equal or greater than the size of a claw base. The other two species have forewings that are longer than their prothorax, and hindwings that exceed the length of their abdomens.|$|R

Though the fall of humankind into sin resulted in lasting consequences the Judeao-Christian tradition has had little trouble in identifying this distinction. But it is when the devil (and his followers) seek to challenge God’s dominion {{that the role of}} God becomes sullied through the seeming victories of the <b>devil.</b> C. <b>S.</b> Lewis was signally aware of spiritual warfare. He explored this in many of his writings, but it was especially The Screwtape Letters that fired the imagination of personal spiritual warfare. These were in story-like fashion from the perspective of demons in conversation with one another in the attempt to corrupt, dominate and destroy particular human subjects. The wider applicatory value of these letters is manifested in Lewis’s final letter from Screwtape: it is this letter that addresses the education system and shows how, from the devil’s perspective, matters such as the desensitisation of evil, normalising of forms of violence and deceit all bear evidence of the shifting moral adjustments Lewis identified in the education system of his day. The consequence of this has taken on the semblance of normality so that this normalisation constantly adjusts to the on- going progression towards still weirder and deeper forms of evil...|$|R
