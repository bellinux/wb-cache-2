Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer is <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} {{his love for}} her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing {{thousands of dollars in}} cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E

Following this event, which marked the culmination of Greater Romania's creation, he was named the first rector of the Superior Dacia University in Cluj. A Franz Joseph University already existed in the city, but its Hungarian faculty departed as a bloc and an entirely new professorial corps and administrative structure were required. The revamped university had two founders, the idealistic Ghibu and the more practical Pușcariu. Chosen by the Directing Council, Transylvania's provisional government, the latter headed a twenty-man committee charged with the seemingly insurmountable task of setting up four faculties (Literature and Philosophy, Medicine, Science, Law) and recruiting professors within a few months. As a native Transylvanian, Pușcariu {{was familiar with the}} Austro-Hungarian milieu; he also had relations with academics in Western Europe and was close to a number of figures in the Old Kingdom, especially Nicolae Iorga. Set up in July 1919, the committee included twelve professors from the Universities of Iași and Bucharest, and eight Transylvanians.|$|E

25|$|A strict {{schedule}} and good sleep hygiene are essential in maintaining any good effects of treatment. With treatment, {{some people with}} mild DSPD may sleep and function well <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earlier sleep schedule. Caffeine and other stimulant drugs to keep a person awake during the day may not be necessary, and should be avoided {{in the afternoon and}} evening, in accordance with good sleep hygiene. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established. Inevitable events of normal life, such as staying up late for a celebration or deadline, or having to stay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> illness, tend to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late times.|$|R
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{themes in the}} Linares' work are the {{animated}} skeleton and the alebrije. Both {{are based on the}} forms and techniques used to make Judas figures and there are early works by the families of human Judas figures with animal heads and wings. According to the family, Pedro Linares came up with the concept of alebrijes as a young man sick <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high fever, dreaming of them and the name. After he became well again, he began to create the monsters he saw in his dreams. Despite the story, Pedro Linares himself admitted that the creatures evolved over his lifetime. These creatures are often a composite of various real and imaginary animals painted in bright colors and wild designs. The creating of these creatures soon spread to Celaya and then into the state of Oaxaca, where there are carved from wood rather than shaped from paper products. Examples of these creatures can be found in various museums in Mexico including the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo as well as the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. The grand scale of imitation has had its benefits and drawbacks. Since their invention, alebrijes have morphed into more contemporary forms with images from rock stars, superheroes and more. Daniel Barrera is a known cartonería artist from Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl. His alebrije works tend to be based on popular culture, especially rock bands such as Judas Priest as well as the alebrije tradition. However, the family notes that there is a serious problem with other artists passing off their wares as from the Linares family.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E

Amy loses hope, but Bender says that they will win due to his {{upcoming}} debate against Professor Farnsworth, {{the leader of the}} Proposition Infinity opposition. At the debate (moderated by the head of George Takei) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, relaying a story from his past where {{he was in love with}} a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robot, breaking his heart. Because of this, the Professor hates robosexuals. [...] This does not impress the audience.

[...] Having suppressed the truth for so long, Farnsworth reveals that the robot's name was actually Unit C and that he caught her in bed with another robot. [...] With his heart broken, he takes his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, now fully in support of Proposition Infinity. The next day the proposition is approved. Amy is ecstatic, but Bender quickly dumps her when he realizes marriage means that he must be monogamous. Amy is dejected, but Kif wins back her heart by adopting a bad boy persona and the two ride off together on a motorcycle.|$|E
