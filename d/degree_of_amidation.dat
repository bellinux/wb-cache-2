40|$|Abstract Novel thermo- and pH-dual {{responsive}} amphiphilic copolymers were synthesized {{based on}} hy-perbranched polyethylenimine (PEI) by grafting L-phenyl-alanine. The phenylalanine-modified PEI exhibited lower cytotoxicity than commercial PEI. These copolymers showed the phenomena of phase transitions {{in response to}} pH and temperature. The dilute copolymer solution at lower pH displayed the higher LCST. Furthermore, LCST increased with the increasing of phenylalanine grafting density. LCST of these copolymers were tunable from 7. 2 to 59. 6 C by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> and pH of solution. DLS and TEM experiments certified that the copolymer chains aggregated to form small size particles as increasing the temperature above LCST. For these reasons, the obtained smart copolymers {{were considered to be}} potential gene/drug carriers in biomedical field...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{process of}} amphiphilic dendritic copolymers(ADPs) with a hydrophilic core and a hydrophobic shell was investigated via laser light scattering. The self-assembly occurs via a fast step and a slow step with different relaxation times. At the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), the fusion of small micelles results in the rapid increase of the micelle size in the fast step. The slow step is associated with equilibrium through the fission and fusion of the micelles. The micelle size increases with the unimer concentration, {{which leads to a}} lower micelle concentration. The lower micelle concentration makes the relaxation time of the fast step increase with increasing unimer concentration. However, the fusion of larger micelles at higher concentration is more efficient to increase micelle size. The fusion of small micelles with large micelles at higher concentration accelerates the approaching equilibrium of the micelles except for the fission and fusion of micelles. With the increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> (DA), the relaxation time in the fast step increases and in the slow step it decreases...|$|E
40|$|It is {{more and}} more {{realised}} that pectins are complex mixtures of many different molecules and research is directed towards the fractionation and characterisation of these pectic sub-populations. Since fractionation of pectins generally results in only low amounts of purified material, rapid characterisation methods using low amounts of samples are required. In this study, capillary electrophoresis was chosen to characterise pectins because only tiny amounts of sample are needed for the analysis. A new capillary electrophoresis (CE) protocol was developed to determine the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation,</b> the degree of methyl-esterification (DM) and consequently the degree of substitution (DS) of pectins by analysing the pectins before and after removal of the methyl-esters. The CE results were compared with results obtained for the same pectins by using titration and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy methods. The CE method was found to be rather reliable resulting in small standard deviations for the DS and DAm. The CE method had the advantage of being rapid due to the limited sample preparation and automation of the analysis. In addition, CE was used successfully to determine the degree of blockiness of the free GalA residues over the pectic backbone...|$|E
40|$|The intermolecular {{distributions}} of amide groups within two commercial LMA pectins was studied after {{removal of the}} methyl esters followed by fractionation of the different populations by anion exchange chromatography. The populations obtained had almost equal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> while the values <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> blockiness were not the same, indicating also a different intramolecular distribution of the substituents considered as semirandom. Populations from the methyl-esterified amidated pectins showed a rather random distribution for almost all populations. A striking difference between these different populations was that, despite {{the same level of}} substitution, the ratio between amide groups and methyl esters varied significantly, indicating a heterogeneous amidation process...|$|R
40|$|Background. There {{is a major}} {{clinical}} {{need for}} strategies for adequately reconstructing the soft tissue defects found after deep burns, tumor resection, or trauma. A promising solution is adipose tissue engineering with preadipocytes, stem-cell derived precursors of the adipose tissue, implanted within biomaterials. This pilot study evaluated hyaluronan gels mixed with autologous undifferentiated preadipocytes in a pig model for their potency to generate new fat. Materials and methods. Preadipocytes were isolated from intra-abdominal pig fat by collagenase digestion, plated on fibronectin-coated culture dishes in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Ham’s F 12 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) combined with 10 % pig serum, expanded, and mixed with hyaluronan gel.

40|$|Thickening and gelling {{properties}} of commercial amidated pectins {{depend on the}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> and methyl-esterification, but also the distribution of these groups is of great importance. Methods have been developed {{during the last few}} years to determine the distribution of methyl esters over the pectic backbone. We applied the strategies developed for the analysis of high methyl-esterified pectins for studying the distribution of amide groups in amidated pectins. Low methyl-esterified amidated (LMA) pectins were digested before and after removal of methyl esters by an endo-polygalacturonase to determine the degree of blockiness of the substituents. The nature of the substituents (amide groups compared to methyl esters) did not modify the behavior of the enzyme. Oligomers released were separated by using high-performance anion exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) at pH 5. Fractions collected after on-line desalting were identified by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Oligomers were found to elute from the column as a function of their total charge. For the same overall charge and size, oligomers with methyl esters eluted before oligomers with amide groups. Both amide groups and methyl esters of the LMA pectins studied were found to be semirandomly distributed over the pectic backbone, but this may vary according to the amidation process used...|$|E
40|$|The {{peptidoglycan}} of Staphylococcus aureus {{is characterized}} by a high degree of crosslinking and almost completely lacks free carboxyl groups, due to amidation of the D-glutamic acid in the stem peptide. Amidation of peptidoglycan has been proposed to play a decisive role in polymerization of cell wall building blocks, correlating with the crosslinking of neighboring peptidoglycan stem peptides. Mutants with a reduced <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> are less viable and show increased susceptibility to methicillin. We identified the enzymes catalyzing the formation of D-glutamine in position 2 of the stem peptide. We provide biochemical evidence that the reaction is catalyzed by a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein and a Mur ligase homologue, encoded by SA 1707 and SA 1708, respectively. Both proteins, for which we propose the designation GatD and MurT, are required for amidation and appear to form a physically stable bi-enzyme complex. To investigate the reaction in vitro we purified recombinant GatD and MurT His-tag fusion proteins and their potential substrates, i. e. UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, as well as the membrane-bound cell wall precursors lipid I, lipid II and lipid II-Gly 5. In vitro amidation occurred with all bactoprenol-bound intermediates, suggesting that in vivo lipid II and/or lipid II-Gly 5 may be substrates for GatD/MurT. Inactivation of the GatD active site abolished lipid II amidation. Both, murT and gatD are organized in an operon and are essential genes of S. aureus. BLAST analysis revealed the presence of homologous transcriptional units in a number of gram-positive pathogens, e. g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumonia and Clostridium perfringens, al...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of calcium}} {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) is restricted by {{their lack of}} macroporosity and poor drug release properties. To overcome these two limitations, incorporating degradable polymer microparticles into CPC is an attractive option, as polymer microparticles could help to control drug release and induce macroporosity after degradation. Although few authors have yet tested synthetic polymers, the potentiality of polysaccharides’ assuming this role has never been explored. Low-methoxy amidated pectins (LMAP) constitute valuable candidates because of their biocompatibility and ionic and pH sensitivity. In this study, the potentiality of a LMAP {{with a degree of}} esterification (DE) of 30 and a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>amidation</b> (DA) of 19 was explored. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the influence of LMAP microspheres within the composite on the cement properties, drug release ability and final macroporosity after microspheres degradation. Three LMAP incorporation ratios, 2 %, 4 % and 6 % w/w were tested, and ibuprofen was chosen as the model drug. In comparison with the CPC reference, the resulting composites presented reduced setting times and lowered the mechanical properties, which remained acceptable for an implantation in moderate-stress-bearing locations. Sustained release of ibuprofen was obtained on at least 45 days, and release rates were found to be controlled by the LMAP ratio, which modulated drug diffusion. After 4 months of degradation study, the resulting CPC appeared macroporous, with a maximum macroporosity of nearly 30 % for the highest LMAP incorporation ratio, and interconnectivity between pores could be observed. In conclusion, LMAP appear as interesting candidates to generate macroporous bone cements with tailored release properties and macroporosity by adjusting the pectin content within the composites...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Amidation</b> <b>of</b> the {{carboxyl}} terminal of many peptides {{is essential}} for full biological potency, often increasing receptor binding and stability. The single enzyme responsible for this reaction is peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM: EC 1. 14. 17. 3), a copper- and ascorbate-dependent Type I membrane protein. Methods: To make large amounts of high molecular weight amidated product, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were engineered to express exogenous PAM. To vary access of the enzyme to its substrate, exogenous PAM was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, endosomes and lysosomes or to the lumen of the secretory pathway. Results: PAM was equally active when targeted to each intracellular location and assayed in homogenates. Immunocytochemical analyses of CHO cells and a pituitary cell line demonstrated that targeting of exogenous PAM was partially successful. PAM substrates generated by expressing peptidylglycine substrates (glucagon-like peptide 1 -Gly, peptide YY-Gly and neuromedin U-Gly) fused to the C-terminus of immunoglobulin Fc in CHO cell lines producing targeted PAM.
