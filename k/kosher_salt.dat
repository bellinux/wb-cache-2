2500|$|To {{comply with}} this prohibition, {{a number of}} {{preparation}} techniques became practiced within traditional Judaism. The main technique, known as melihah, involves the meat being soaked in water for about half an hour, which opens pores. After this, the meat is placed on a slanted board or in a wicker basket, and is thickly covered with salt on each side, then left for between 20 minutes and one hour. The salt covering draws blood from the meat by osmosis, and the salt must be subsequently removed from the meat (usually by trying to shake most of it off and then washing the meat twice) to complete the extraction of the blood. [...] The type of salt used in the process is known as <b>kosher</b> <b>salt.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rather than cubic crystals, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> has a flat plate-like shape. <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> {{may also}} have a hollow {{pyramidal}} shape. The flat form of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is usually made when cubic crystals are forced into this shape under pressure, usually between rollers. The pyramidal salt crystals are generally made by an evaporative process called the Alberger process. <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is usually manufactured with a grain size larger than table salt grains.|$|E

5000|$|Vampiros {{may be made}} in a tall {{glass or}} an old {{fashioned}} glass. Bartenders may first [...] "rim" [...] the glass with <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt,</b> which is done by placing a layer of <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt</b> on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt,</b> so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim. The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.|$|E

50|$|Because of its mineral {{complexity}} and coarse grain size, sel gris {{can be used}} both as a cooking salt and a finishing salt. Being much denser than table and <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> {{there is a lot}} more salt in an equivalent volume of sel gris.|$|E
50|$|Because it is a moist salt, it {{does not}} suck all the {{moisture}} out of food when used as a finishing salt, unlike <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> (which is designed to absorb blood and other fluids from meat). Selmeliers tend to pair sels gris with heartier foods like steak and root vegetables due to their mineral complexity.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} use of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is {{for removing}} surface blood from meat by desiccation, {{as part of}} the koshering process for meat. The meat is soaked in cool water, drained, covered with a thin layer of salt, then allowed to stand on a rack or board for an hour. The salt remains {{on the surface of the}} meat, for the most part undissolved, and absorbs fluids from the meat. The salt grains are then washed off and discarded, carrying away the fluids absorbed. Compare this process to full desiccation of meat, which yields salt-cured meat.|$|E

5000|$|The kimmelweck roll (sometimes spelled [...] "kummelweck" [...] or [...] "kümmelweck"), {{topped with}} <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> and caraway seeds, gives the {{sandwich}} its {{name and a}} distinctive taste. Kümmel is the German word for caraway, and weck means [...] "roll" [...] in the south-western German dialects of the Saarland, Baden and Swabia areas (northern Germans generally say brötchen). However, the roll used for this American sandwich tends to be softer and fluffier than a standard German Kümmelbrötchen or Kümmelweck. In Austria, a similar type of small white-bread is known as Kümmelweckerl (diminutive from Wecken, which refers to a whole big bread, i.e. Brotwecken).|$|E
50|$|When {{tobacco is}} burned, oils from {{adjoining}} not yet ignited particles vaporize and condense into the existing cake {{on the walls}} of the bowl and shank. Over time, these oils can oxidize and turn rancid, causing the pipe to give a sour or bitter smoke. A purported countermeasure involves filling the bowl with <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> and carefully wetting it with strong spirits. It is important to not use iodized salt, as the iodine and other additives may impart an unpleasant flavor. Regularly wiping out the bowl with spirits such as vodka or rum is helpful in preventing souring. Commercial pipe-sweetening products are also available.|$|E
50|$|Korean sea salt, with {{a larger}} grain size and lower sodium content {{compared}} to common <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> {{is used for the}} initial salting of napa cabbages. Being minimally processed, it serves to help developing flavors in fermented foods. Per 100 g water, around 2 g of salt is used. Half of the salt is dissolved in water before putting the cabbages in, and the other half is sprinkled in between the layers of napa cabbages that were washed, trimmed, and halved or quartered lengthwise. The cabbages are salted in the brine for several hours, turned over, then salted for more hours. After that, salted cabbages are washed thoroughly under running water and drained.|$|E

50|$|There are {{multiple}} variants {{of the common}} roll, differing in size, type of flour used, and toppings. While traditionally plain, Kaiser-style rolls are today found topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin kernels, linseed, or sunflower seeds. The Kaiser roll is a main part of a typical Austrian breakfast, usually served with butter and jam. It is often used as a bun for such popular sandwiches as hamburgers in America, and {{with a slice of}} Leberkäse in Germany (and Austria itself), though sliced Extrawurst and pickled gherkins (Wurstsemmel), or a type of Wiener Schnitzel (Schnitzelsemmel) are also used. A variation called a kimmelweck is topped with <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> and caraway, and in the United States is an essential component of a Buffalo-area specialty, the beef on weck sandwich.|$|E
50|$|Saltiness is {{the taste}} of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to {{moderate}} proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are {{many different types of}} salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} the causes of an {{infection}} or disease will be obvious (such as fin rot), though in other cases it {{may be due to}} water conditions, requiring special testing equipment and chemicals to appropriately adjust the water. Isolating diseased fish can help prevent the spread of infection to healthy fish in the tank. This also allows the use of chemicals or drugs which may damage the nitrogen cycle, plants or chemical filtration of a properly-functioning tank. Other alternatives include short baths in a bucket that contains the treated water. Salt baths can be used as an antiseptic and fungicide, and will not damaging beneficial bacteria, though ordinary table salt may contain additives which can harm fish. Alternatives include aquarium salt, <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> or rock salt. Gradually raising the temperature of the tank may kill certain parasites, though some diseased fish may be harmed and certain species can not tolerate high temperatures. Aeration is necessary since less oxygen is dissolved in warm water.|$|E
50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea-salt, rock salt, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|E
5000|$|A French press {{works best}} with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, about the {{consistency}} of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt.</b> Finer grounds, when immersed in water, have lower permeability, requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger {{and are more likely}} to seep through or around the perimeter of the press filter and into the coffee. Additionally, finer grounds will tend to over-extract and cause the coffee to taste bitter. Coffee is brewed by placing the ground coffee in the empty beaker and adding hot—between —water, in proportions of about [...] of coffee grounds to [...] of water, more or less to taste. The brewing time is about two to four minutes. The plunger is pressed to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker. The mesh piston normally does not compress the coffee grounds, as most designs leave a generous space—about —below the piston in its lowest position. If the brewed coffee is allowed to remain in the beaker with the used grounds, the coffee may become astringent and bitter, though this is an effect that some users of the French press consider desirable. It is believed that the optimum time for brewing the coffee is around four minutes, and some consider the coffee spoiled after about 20 minutes. Other approaches, such as cold-brewing, require several hours of contact between the water and the grounds to achieve the desired extraction.|$|E
5000|$|Ital, also spelled I-tal (...) , is food often {{celebrated by}} those in the Rastafari movement. It is {{compulsory}} in the Nyabinghi mansion though not in the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Remi mansions. The word derives from the English word [...] "vital", with the initial [...] "v" [...] removed. [...] This is done to many words in the Rastafari vocabulary to signify {{the unity of the}} speaker with all of nature. The expression of Ital eating varies widely from Rasta to Rasta, and there are few universal rules of Ital living.The primary goal of adhering to an Ital diet is to increase Livity, or the life energy that Rastafari generally believe lives within all human beings, as conferred from the Almighty. A common tenet of Rastafari beliefs is the sharing of a central Livity among living things, and what is put into one's body should enhance Livity rather than reduce it. Though there are different interpretations of ital regarding specific foods, the general principle is that food should be natural, or pure, and from the earth; Rastafari therefore often avoid food which is chemically modified or contains artificial additives (e.g., colour, flavourings, and preservatives). Some also avoid added salt in foods, especially salt with the artificial addition of iodine, while pure sea or <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is eaten by some. In strict interpretations, foods that have been produced using chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizer are not considered ital. Early adherents adopted their dietary laws based on their interpretation of several books of the Bible, including the Book of Genesis ("Then God said, [...] "I give you every Seed-bearing plant {{on the face of the}} whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food." [...] (Genesis 1:29)), the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Along with growing dreadlocks and the sacramental smoking of ganja, observing a vegetarian diet is one of the practices early Rastafari adopted from Indian indentured servants living in Jamaica. Rastafari's founder Leonard Howell, affectionately called [...] "Gong" [...] and [...] "Gyangunguru Maragh", though not of Indian descent, was fascinated with Hindu practices and was instrumental in promoting a plant-based diet in the Rastafari community of Pinnacle.|$|E
40|$|Higher {{risks of}} food-borne illness {{associated}} with increased consumption of poultry products make it necessary to identify potential sources of contamination and apply intervention strategies that will prevent or {{minimize the risk of}} contamination during processing. This study investigated the effects of chemical and natural decontamination treatments including sprayed application of acidified calcium sulfate (ACS) in combination with -polylysine (EPL), dry-rubbing <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> coating and molten paraffin wax dipping application on microbial populations of broiler carcasses and parts. Treatments were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the numbers of artificially inoculated rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain NVSL 95 - 1776 on the skin surface of bone-in chicken breasts. General model procedures were used to find statistical differences (P 2 log reductions) were also observed in validation trials in both pre- and post-chilled samples when compared to non-treated pre- and post-chilled controls. Only for psychrotrophic counts, chilled and post-chill interventions did not have a significant effect (P> 0. 05). The use of molten paraffin wax caused < 0. 51 CFU/ml log reductions on rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium in chicken breasts. In addition, drip loss on kosher treated samples was 53. 8 % lower than non-treated counterparts. However, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> application caused a decrease in lightness (*L values) and yellowness (*b values) on treated carcasses when compared to controls, redness (*a values) were not significantly affected. Results indicate that the combined use of ACS and EPL at the stated conditions and the coating application of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> on broiler carcasses significantly reduce pathogen contamination and microbial indicator loads, thus providing an alternative validated antimicrobial intervention for potential use by the poultry industry...|$|E

Treatments included: 1) seasoning alone, 2) {{a combination of}} seasoning + bromelain (enzymatic tenderizer), or 3) control (no seasoning and/or bromelain). The seasoning included: <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and ground oregano. All of the steaks were cooked to an internal temperature of 71 ° C (medium doneness). Six trained descriptive panelists evaluated the samples. The {{results of this study}} indicate that it may be possible to improve eating quality of choice and select chuck-eye and choice top blade to be more similar to strip steaks of the same USDA grade. Both treatments increased flavor and texture attributes in these samples that have been shown to have an impact on liking scores. Choice chuck-eye samples had decreased bloody/serumy and metallic scores and increased umami and initial flavor impact with both treatments. Both treatments increased brown/roasted flavor in select chuck-eyes. Tenderness, fat-like and umami were increased with the seasoning + bromelain treatment in select chuck-eyes. Choice top blade steaks with seasoning alone had increased umami flavor. Both treatments impacted attributes (fat-like, umami and sour) of the select strip steak that differed from choice strip steaks. The next step to this research is to investigate whether consumer liking scores are consistent with conclusions made from descriptive analysis results. Overall, these treatments could be a valuable tool for beef retailers...|$|E
