40|$|Objective The Bashang Long-tail chicken (BS), an {{indigenous}} Chinese breed, is considered cold tolerant. We selected BS, the Rhode Island Red (RIR), and their reciprocal crossbreds {{for the present}} study. The objectives were: i) to validate whether BS is cold tolerant and whether egg production and cold tolerance of crossbreds could be improved; and ii) to determine the physiological characteristics that underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> in cold environments. Methods A total of 916 chickens were reared in warm and natural cold environments (daily mean ambient temperature varied from 7. 4 °C to 26. 5 °C in the warm environment and from − 17. 5 °C to 27. 0 °C in the cold environment). To investigate their adaptability to the cold environment, the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> and body weight were monitored and compared between breeds and environments. The cloacal temperature and serum biochemical parameters were monitored to reveal the physiological characteristics underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> in the cold environment. Results The warm environment experiment showed that RIR had the highest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance,</b> and that the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> than BS. While in the cold environment RIR had the lowest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance,</b> and the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> than BS. In the cold environment BS and reciprocal crossbreds had higher triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine levels than RIR. At 35 and 39 wk of age, when the ambient temperature was extremely low (varied from − 20 °C to 0 °C), serum glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol of BS and crossbreds were higher than RIR. Conclusion Bashang Long-tail chicken has a favorable cold tolerance ability. Crossbreeding with RIR and BS is {{an effective way to}} develop cold tolerant chickens with improved <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E

30|$|Inclusion {{of potato}} {{slightly}} reduced the feed cost, although <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and quality were statistically insignificant {{and found to}} be similar among the treatment groups. A slightly higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and better feed conversion ratio were observed in the control group, which {{might be due to}} the high feed intake of hens compared to the potato meal-fed hens. Again, this lower <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> {{may be due to the}} high fibre content in potato meal arising from the poor nutrient utilization by birds.

However, the results are in agreement with some of the studies with sweet potato used as a substitute for maize. Ladokun and Tewe [15] reported that <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> reduced due to the high fibre content of sweet potato and the low protein utilizations by birds fed on sweet potato meal diet.

Six molt diets consisting of 16, 13, or 10 % CP with or without. 15 % supplemental Met were then fed until <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> reached approximately 10 %, at which time all hens received a 16 % CP layer diet for 30 wk in Experiments 1 and 2 and for 4 wk in Experiment 3. In Experiment 1 (summer), hens regained body weight more rapidly, returned to production faster, and had larger egg weights (Weeks 1 to 4) when fed the 16 or 13 % CP molt diets than when fed the 10 % CP molt diet. Long-term <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> <b>egg</b> yield (grams of egg per hen per day) (Weeks 1 to 30), and feed efficiency (Weeks 1 to 8) were greater for hens fed the 16 or 13 % CP molt diets compared with those fed the 10 % CP molt diet.

40|$|Postmating sexual {{selection}} {{plays an important}} part in the evolution of secondary sexual characters. Based on differential allocation theory that predicts biased reproductive investment of females depending on the attractiveness of mates, a number of previous studies have shown that egg production is related in various ways to ornamental sexual traits of males, but evidence for behavioural sexual traits is less abundant. In this study we examine such maternal effects in relation to birdsong. Because the Bengalese finch is a monomorphic songbird, courtship song serves a key role in mate choice. To take into account individual female differences in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance,</b> we sequentially paired naive, captive, female Bengalese finches to two different males, and investigated if their reproductive investment (clutch size, egg mass and hatchling sex ratio) was related to the song traits of their mates. We found that clutch size and egg mass were highly repeatable within individual females while sex ratio was not. Despite the inflexibility of egg mass within each female, egg mass increased when females were mated to males with longer songs. In addition, we found a non-significant weak tendency toward male-biased sex ratio in relation to longer song duration of mates. Our findings suggest that females mated to better mates adjusted their reproductive investment by producing heavier eggs and possibly offspring of the more costly sex...|$|E

Increasing Ca level on feed showed an increasing trend of <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The average feed consumption ranged at 151 - 159 g/duck/day; <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was 75 - 84 %, and the feed conversion was 184 - 212 g/egg...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate an appropriate inclusion level of locally produced unprocessed or expander-processed coloured flowered faba bean (FB) (cv. ‘Kontu’) seeds in diets for laying hens. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> and <b>egg</b> quality variables were determined with 560 hens (Lohmann Selected Leghorn, LSL Classic) in a 40 -week continued experiment. The hens were fed one of the five diets containing soybean meal as the main protein source. A diet without FB was served as a control diet. Both unprocessed and expander-processed FB was tested either in proportions of 50 g kg- 1 or 100 g kg- 1 in the diet. Faba bean inclusion (control vs. FB diets) had no effect on the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rate, <b>egg</b> mass <b>production,</b> feed consumption, or feed conversion ratio, but it decreased egg weight (p< 0. 05). Dietary FB inclusion tended to increase the mortality of the hens (p< 0. 10). Faba bean processing had no effects on <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> parameters or hen mortality. Daily <b>egg</b> mass <b>production</b> decreased and feed conversion ratio increased when FB proportion increased (from 50 to 100 g kg- 1, p< 0. 05). Faba bean inclusion had no effects on egg exterior quality. It can be concluded that 50 g kg- 1 of the FB studied (cv. ‘Kontu’) can be used in the diets of laying hens (LSL Classic) without negative effects on <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> or livability...|$|R

40|$|Data were {{collected}} from 54 selected farms of key rearers at Badalgachi thana in the Naogaon district in Bangladesh to investigate <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> of a breed and three crossbreeds/breed. The Rhode Island Red (RIR) x Fayoumi attained late sexual maturity (222 d). However, during a period up to 46 weeks of age they produced {{the highest number of}} eggs (41. 6 eggs, hd and 31. 2 eggs, hh) with the highest rate of lay (37 %, hd and 32 %, hh) of the largest size (44. 4 g) and the thickest shell (0. 333 mm) with the highest albumen height, yolk height and yolk colour fan score (8. 2 mm and 18. 9 mm, 9. 8), respectively. The others were the pure-bred Fayoumi and the two crosses Naked Neck × Fayoumi and Naked Neck × RIR. Supplement of feed ranged from 15 to 45 g per hen. Birds receiving the highest level had the highest rate of lay, hd (39. 6 %) with the largest size (42. 2 g). Supplementary feed levels did not influence age at sexual maturity, body weight, or any egg quality traits. Locations did not have an effect on age at sexual maturity and egg production. Breeds, supplementary levels of feed, and locations did not affect mortality. However, mortality due to predators was significantly higher in RIR x Fayoumi...|$|E
40|$|Data on 272 eggs {{collected}} from Pearl (175 eggs) and Black (97 eggs) adult guinea fowl strains were analyzed {{to determine the}} <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> and egg quality characteristics of the birds. Data generated were analyzed using Students t-test. The external egg quality traits measured were egg weight, egg length, egg width, shell weight, shell thickness and egg shape index. Internal egg quality traits studied include egg mass, yolk weight, yolk height, yolk diameter, yolk index, albumen weight, albumen height and albumen diameter and albumen index. The production performance traits measured were egg number and Hen-Day Production (HDP). In addition, weekly body weight of the hens was also recorded. Egg number was significantly (p 0. 05) between HDP of the two strains, the Black strain had higher HDP in all the weeks except in weeks 1, 5 and 6. Among the internal traits, albumen diameter differed significantly (p< 0. 05) between Pearl and Black with mean values of 61. 272. 02 mm and 66. 971. 20 mm, respectively. Effect of strain was not observed {{for all the other}} egg traits measured. However, the significant difference (p< 0. 05) observed for egg number and albumen diameter between the strains suggests at least some degree of genetic dissimilarity, which implies that the strains could be used to improve egg production and egg quality characteristics of guinea fowl in the study region...|$|E
40|$|Laying hens {{were fed}} {{commercial}} diets added with supplemented fat (SFAT) at 0. 6, 1. 2, and 1. 8 % {{in order to}} study the long term dietary effects - on - their productive performance from 22 to 75 wk of age. Five hundred and seventy six Single Comb White Leghorn hens were {{assigned to one of}} the four dietary treatments. The experimental phase consisted of three periods of 18 wk each. The final body weight and gain of hens fed on diets with SFAT at 1. 2 % and 1. 8 % were lower (p< 0. 05) than those hens given no SFAT. The SFAT at the 1. 2 % and 1. 8 % levels improved egg production rate, egg weight and mass, as well as FCR. Mortality and feed consumption were not affected by dietary SFAT. Administration of a diet with SFAT significantly decreased the cracked-broken egg ratio (p< 0. 01). The beneficial effects of SFAT on <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> were particularly more pronounced at intermediate and later ages. Hence, SFAT by period interactions were significant for all traits studied except feed intake. Hens fed SFAT deposited significantly higher abdominal fat than those on the no-SFAT diet. As a result, SFAT at 1. 2 % and 1. 8 % inclusion levels provided benefits in terms of efficient table egg production...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} for eight weeks {{to determine the effect}} of different light sources on the <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> of <b>egg</b> laying birds. For this purpose, 384 single comb White Leghorn layers 40 -weeks of age, in their first laying cycle, were obtained from the Poultry Research Centre, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. The layers were randomly divided into 12 basic experimental units comprising 32 laying hens each, to be designated as replicate. These 12 replicates were further divided into three treatment groups viz; A (fluorescent), B (compact fluorescent), and C (incandescent), each comprising 128 layers. <b>Production</b> <b>performance</b> of birds under different treatments was compared in terms of body weight, feed consumption, <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> feed conversion ratio, mortality and economics. Hen-day <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (%) was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in groups B and C compared to group A. Analysis of data on feed conversion ratio showed that layers in group A and B were significantly less efficient in feed conversion compared to those of group C; difference between the former two groups was non-significant. However, light sources showed non-significant effect on feed consumption, body weight and mortality of the birds. Birds of group B fetched more profit than those of groups A and C...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Three light sources: Cool-White (C), Vita-Lite (V), and {{tungsten}} (T), each at two intensities (20 or 50 lx), {{were used}} to supplement light to 16 hr in a 24 -hr cycle for geese main-tained in open-shed pens. Two lines of mixed breeds of geese, white and grey, were used and <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was followed from the 27 th week of age through 6 months of the laying period, A significant increase in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was found under the C light illumination.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the dietary effects of persimmon peel (PP) and PP ethanol extract (PPE) on <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> <b>egg</b> quality, and liver lipids in the late stage of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in laying hens. One hundred and twenty 50 -wk-old Hy-Line Brown layers (n = 120) were fed different diets. Four replicate groups of 6 hens each were randomly assigned to 5 dietary treatments. The 5 dietary treatments were as follows: i) CON, basal diet; ii) PP 0. 15, CON+ 0. 15 % PP (0. 035 % tannin); iii) PP 0. 5, CON + 0. 5 % PP (0. 117 % tannin); iv) PPE 0. 075, CON+ 0. 075 % PPE (0. 03 % tannin); and v) PPE 0. 25, CON+ 0. 25 % PPE (0. 11 % tannin). The total tannin concentration of PPE was higher (p< 0. 05) than that of PP. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> in the PP 0. 5 group was higher than in the other groups. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> and mass of hens in the PPE 0. 25 group showed a greater decrease than that in the other groups (p< 0. 05). Eggshell color in the PP 0. 15, PP 0. 5, and PPE 0. 075 groups was lighter than that of the control group (p< 0. 05). The Haugh unit for the groups that were fed PP and PPE were significantly higher than that in the other groups after 7 d of storage (p< 0. 05). Therefore, PP seems an effective feed additive for improving the <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> and <b>egg</b> quality in late stage laying hens...|$|R
