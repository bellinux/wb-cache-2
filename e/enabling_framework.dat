40|$|Cities {{represent}} a challenge {{and an opportunity}} for climate change policy. As the hubs of economic activity, cities generate the bulk of GHG emissions and are thus important to mitigation strategies. Urban planning will shape future trends and the concentration of population, socio-economic activity, poverty and infrastructure in urban areas translates into particular vulnerability to increased climate hazards. City governments and urban stakeholders will therefore be essential {{in the design and}} delivery of cost-effective adaptation policies. Further, by empowering local governments, national policies could leverage existing local experiments, accelerate policy responses, foster resource mobilization and engage local stakeholders. This paper presents a framework for multilevel governance, showing that advancing governance of climate change across all levels of government and relevant stakeholders is crucial to avoid policy gaps between local action plans and national policy frameworks (vertical integration) and to encourage cross-scale learning between relevant departments or institutions in local and regional governments (horizontal dimension). Vertical and horizontal integration allows two-way benefits: locally-led or bottom-up where local initiatives influence national action and nationally-led or top-down where <b>enabling</b> <b>frameworks</b> empower local players. The most promising frameworks combine the two into hybrid models of policy dialogue where the lessons learnt are used to modify and fine-tune <b>enabling</b> <b>frameworks</b> and disseminated horizontally, achieving more efficient local implementation of climate strategies. globalisation, environmental policy, competitiveness, supply chain, eco-innovation...|$|R

It contends that such an <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> should facilitate coherent government policies and legislation, secure procurement reform, enhance capacity, foster stringent - albeit not constraining -financial regulation and put in place supportive institutional arrangements. Arguing that PPPs revolve around risk sharing between the public and private sector, value for money and affordability, key features of the South African policy environment as it affects PPPs are discussed. Amid considerable progress, policies across sectors could still be better aligned, legislative inconsistencies straightened out, procurement procedures and approaches updated to focus more sharply on value for money (rather than lowest price) and financial uncertainties countered. It is also noted that PPPs currently occur in an institutional vacuum in the public sector. It is therefore proposed that a dedicated institutional capacity be created to support PPPs more effectively. ...|$|E

40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{operations are}} becoming increasingly complex due to an escalating number of actors and infrastructure capacity bottlenecks. Today’s transportation operations rely on static procedures instead of being actively controlled to achieve effective synchronization of the actors’ operations, resulting in slow responses to events and long waiting times in the transportation setup. Information availability is a prerequisite to control and plan freight transportation operations. Literature covers several studies on information sharing between suppliers and customers, but studies involving the transport operators are few. Together with the shortcomings of today’s transportation setups, this calls for models on increased use, availability and sharing of information between actors. This thesis {{is based on an}} extensive information requirements study involving all the actors in an international transportation setup. An in-depth study of the involved actors was carried out and the requirements of effective transportation operations were extracted through literature studies, interviews, observations and document studies. The main contribution is a model of effective transportation operations and an <b>enabling</b> <b>framework.</b> Some of the results, including the framework, have previously been published in the three appended papers. The requirements analysis, the model of effective transportation operations and the <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> were mainly validated through a demonstration prototype and a validation case.

Actors in the transportation setup need to share and use more information in order to achieve more effective transportation operations...|$|E
