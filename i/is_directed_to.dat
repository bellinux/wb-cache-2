5|$|Lucy {{opens the}} prison cells, {{starting}} a riot, and Johnson fends off {{a large group}} of prisoners while May and Coulson escape. Mack and Reyes find Morrow, who is hesitant to trust S.H.I.E.L.D. but agrees to leave with them when he hears that Lucy has the Darkhold. Morrow <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> safety, while Reyes stops to confront one of the prisoners, a member of the gang who were responsible for him becoming the Ghost Rider. The prisoner reveals that they were hired to carry out the job, but does not know who by, before the Ghost Rider murders him. Outside the prison, Morrow is found by Lucy who needs his help to read the Darkhold and revert her ghostly state.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

5|$|The highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and {{continues}} eastward to Kalkaska. There, M-72 meets US131/M-66 (Cedar Street) {{on the north}} side of downtown, and M-72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown. South of town, the highway crosses the Boardman River again, and M-72 turns east again headed toward the city of Grayling. M-66 follows M-72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City. M-72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska–Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp Grayling military reservation. North of the camp gate, M-72 joins M-93 into downtown Grayling. Together they meet James Street, which carries Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). M-93 turns north to follow BL I-75 out of town, and M-72 turns south to follow it through downtown. At South Down River Road, M-72 turns east again to leave Grayling, crossing I-75 in the process. There is no direct access to I-75 from M-72. Instead traffic <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> follow BL I-75 in either direction to get to the freeway.|$|E

25|$|Self-perception is a {{specialized}} form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists {{have found that}} too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as overjustification. People's attention <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered. This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.|$|E

25|$|Ion etching is a {{sputtering}} {{process that}} can remove very fine quantities of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a plasma stream that <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.|$|E
25|$|The maximum {{heart rate}} (HRmax) is the highest heart rate an {{individual}} can achieve without severe problems through exercise stress, and generally decreases with age. Since HRmax varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person's HRmax is via a cardiac stress test. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by treadmill) while being monitored by an ECG. The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, {{at which point the}} subject <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes.|$|E
25|$|Pairs of acrylic {{sheets with}} a layer of microreplicated prisms between the sheets can have {{reflective}} and refractive properties that let them redirect part of incoming sunlight in dependence on its angle of incidence. Such panels act as miniature light shelves. Such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting, {{to be used as a}} window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor. This can lead to a higher illumination of the back part of a room, in particular when combined with a white ceiling, while having a slight impact on the view to the outside compared to normal glazing.|$|E

25|$|Several years later, in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court readdressed {{the patent}} {{eligibility}} {{of a business}} method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. This test first determines whether the claimed invention <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the Alice test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.|$|E
25|$|A vector e on a globe on {{the equator}} at point Q <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the north. Suppose we {{parallel}} transport the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) drag it along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we {{notice that the}} parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and {{is caused by the}} curvature of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector {{is a measure of the}} curvature.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> a destination by a large green arrow {{at the top of the}} screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi without paying the driver.|$|E

25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min visual angle), but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to the way most primates move their eyes to focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> various targets.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in the front edge of the ilium <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the front and only weakly developed. The front edge of the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Heaven in Islam differs {{in many respects}} to the concept in Judaism and Christianity. Heaven is {{described}} primarily in physical terms {{as a place where}} every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in Heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in Heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to Heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of Heaven one <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to.</b> It has been said that the lowest level of Heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred times better than the greatest life on Earth. The highest level is the seventh Heaven. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.|$|E
