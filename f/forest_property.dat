2500|$|Frederik Macody Lund, who {{had died}} in 1943, had long {{considered}} Lange to be his [...] "adoptive son" [...] as he had no children himself. As his first wife Augusta died in 1946, Lange inherited Svartskog in Oppegård, an 80 decare <b>forest</b> <b>property.</b> There, he established a kennel which he named [...] Minde-Vildmark, in honour of his late patron. In 1949 Lange however started seeing his neighbours' 21-year-old nanny. He filed for divorce from his wife Anne-Marie at the end of 1950, and the divorce was finalised on 18 February 1952. Lange thus moved from Svartskog, leaving it to Anne-Marie, and planned to marry his new girlfriend. They were engaged in 1951, but the relationship fast broke apart. Lange thereafter met Karin Thurmann-Moe (1927–1978), and they married on 17 June 1952, just two months after they first met. They had one child. In late 1952 Lange bought a 22 decare farm with a kennel, Trollstein in Heggedal, Asker. He received financial support to buy the property from a circle around the libertarian organisation Libertas. In addition to dogs, they had geese, hens, cows and pigs at Trollstein, and they grew potatoes and vegetables for their own use.|$|E

40|$|Fire is a {{dominant}} mechanism of forest renewal {{in most of}} Canada’s forests and its activity is predicted to increase over the coming decades. Individual fire events have been considered to be non-selective with regards to <b>forest</b> <b>properties,</b> but evidence now suggests otherwise. Our objective was therefore to quantify the effect of <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> on fire selectivity or avoidance, evaluate the stability of these effects across varying burn rates, and use these results to map local fire risk across the forests of Canada. We used Canada-wide MODIS-based maps of annual fires and of <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> to identify burned and unburned pixels for the 2002 – 2011 period and to bin them into classes of forest composition (% conifer and broadleaved deciduous), above-ground tree biomass and stand age. Logistic binomial regressions were then used to quantify fire selectivity by <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> classes and by zones of homogeneous fire regime (HFR). Results suggest that fire exhibits a strong selectivity for conifer stands, but an even stronger avoidance of broadleaved stands. In terms of age classes, fire also shows a strong avoidance for young (0 to 29 year) stands. The large differences among regional burn rates do not significantly alter the overall preference and avoidance ratings. Finally, we combined these results on relative burn preference with regional burn rates to map local fire risks across Canada...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} to what extent forest certification schemes contribute to the enhancement of environmental protection in Swedish forestry. Our assessment is built on the analysis of three different data sets, namely: 1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), 2) the Swedish Database for Forest Owner Analysis, presenting data on small-scale forestry practices and certification, and 3) a follow-up mail survey addressed to private small-scale forest owners with certified <b>forest</b> <b>properties.</b> Our NFI analysis indicated some minor improvements in forest conditions, corresponding with the interim target for enhanced biological diversity (dead wood, broad-leaved trees and old forests). The improvements were less evident on large-scale <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> (certified {{in accordance with the}} Forest Stewardship Council scheme) than on small-scale private <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> (mainly certified in accordance with the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes). This contradicts a common assumption that a much higher degree of certification with stricter environmental standards will give more evident positive impacts on environmental conditions. However, results from the follow-up survey showed that more harvesting activity had taken place on certified small-scale <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> than on non-certified properties. This could mean more negative effects on biodiversity. We conclude by stressing the importance of improving quantitative methods for determining a cause-and-effect relationship between certification and nature protection; previous research tends to report rather far-reaching conclusions based on limited data sets.

40|$|High quality {{information}} on forest resources {{is important to}} forest ecosystem management. Traditional ground measurements are labor and resource intensive {{and at the same}} time expensive and time consuming. For most of the Slovenian forests, there is extensive ground-based information on <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> of selected sample locations. However there is no continuous information of objectively measured vegetation height and canopy cover at appropriate resolution. Currently, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology provides detailed measurements of different <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> because of its immediate generation of 3 D data, its accuracy and acquisition flexibility. However, existing LiDAR sensors have limited spatial coverage and relatively high cost of acquisition. Satellite data, on the other hand, are low-cost and offer broader spatial coverage of generalized forest structure, but are not expected to provide accurate information about vegetation height. Integration of LiDAR and satellite data promises to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of <b>forest</b> <b>properties.</b> The primary objective of this study is to model the vegetation height and canopy cover in Slovenia by integrating LiDAR data, Landsat satellite data, and th...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of forests {{is essential for}} monitoring and predicting the role and response of the land surface to global climate change. Globally consistent and frequent measurements can only be made by satellites; unfortunately many current system’s measurements saturate at moderate canopy densities and are {{not directly related to}} <b>forest</b> <b>properties,</b> requiring tenuous empirical relationships that are insensitive to many of the Earth’s most important, Carbon rich forests. Lidar (laser radar) is a relatively new technology that offers the potential to make direct measurements of forest height, vertical density and, when ground based, explicit measurements of structure. In addition measurements do not saturate until much higher forest densities. In recent years there has been much interest in the {{measurement of}} forests by lidar, with a number of airborne and terrestrial and one spaceborne lidar developed. Measuring a forest leaf by leaf is impractical and very tedious, so more rapid ground based methods are needed to collect data to validate satellite derived estimates. These rapid methods are themselves not directly related to <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> causing uncertainty in any validation of remotely sensed estimates. This thesis uses Monte Carlo ray tracing to simulate the measurement of forests by full waveform lidars over explicit geometric forest models for both above and below canopy instruments. Existing methods for deriving <b>forest</b> <b>properties</b> from measurements are tested against the known truth of these simulated forests, a process impossible in reality. Causes of disagreements are explored and new methods developed to attempt to overcome any shortcomings. These new methods include dual wavelength lidar for correcting satellite based measurements for topography and a voxel based method for more directly relating terrestrial lidar signals to <b>forest</b> <b>properties.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Wood and {{commodities}} {{made of it}} have {{a worldwide}} importance. The global forest area consists of 3. 9 milliards (Br) of hectares of forestland; {{which is about a}} third of the total global land area. In year 2000 the amount of round wood felled was 3. 4 milliards (Br) of cubic meters, half of it firewood. The global production of forestry commodities was about one milliard cubic meter in year 2000. The export value of these commodities in world trade was USD 134 000 million and the import value USD 141 000 million. In order to maintain free and unchallenged capital transfers globally it is more and more important for the decision makers to have trustworthy and comparable facts at their disposal. This applies to enterprises and accounting systems (IFRS) as well as different kinds of property valuations (IVS).
