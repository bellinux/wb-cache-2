40|$|In {{the era of}} {{proliferation}} of electronic news media and an ever-growing demand for prompt and concise information natural language text processing technologies which map free texts into structured data format are becoming paramount. Recently, we have witnessed an emergence of publicly accessible news aggregation systems for facilitating navigation through news. This paper reports on some explorations of refining a real-time news event extraction system, which runs {{on top of the}} <b>Europe</b> <b>Media</b> <b>Monitoring</b> news aggregation system developed at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Our experiments focus on the task of detecting new events in a given news story, i. e., tagging events extracted by the core event extraction system as new. Several methods ranging from simple similarity computation of event descriptions of adjacent events to more elaborated ones based on curvature-based topic development analysis and which utilize global knowledge. The paper describes first the particularities of the real-time news event extraction processing chain. Next, {{in order to get a}} better insight how news stories evolve over time some statistics on event dynamics are presented. Finally, the new event detection techniques are introduced and the results of the evaluation are given. JRC. G. 2 -Global security and crisis managemen...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to discover the role of <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> in companies. In more detail, the utilization methods of the <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> results will be examined. This information will be portrayed on a three leveled information processing cycle of “The Knowing Organization” to discover how deep the information is processed in reality. Knowledge and intelligence are often represented as an aid for decision making and this research will broaden the scope by evaluating the utilization of information in different functions inc. marketing, communication, R&D and business intelligence, in addition to executive insight. The theoretical framework used will categorize the actions taken {{on the basis of this}} <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> into three levels: sense-making, knowledge creation and decision making. In addition, the utilization of social <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> will be glanced at. Method: Three companies are researched from differing industries. 12 people from these three companies were interviewed. The research is qualitative by nature and the interview is semi-structured by form. Findings: The findings portray that information from <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> is used always in sense making. The second level, knowledge creation does not occur on every instance and decision making may truly be based on <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> on a few accounts. This said, the level of utilization of <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> outcomes is related to the job description or function of the employee. Social media is still a difficult concept to approach and guidelines in companies for social <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> seem to lack. The main benefit of social <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> is providing a new channel for feedback, but due to anonymity this information is hardly reacted to...|$|R

40|$|Multilingual text {{processing}} is useful because the information content found {{in different languages}} is complementary, both regarding facts and opinions. While Information Extraction and other text mining software can, in principle, be developed for many languages, most text analysis tools have only been applied to small sets of languages because the development effort per language is large. Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the effort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually considerable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system developers on how to minimise the effort of developing natural language processing applications for many languages. We also explain the main guidelines underlying our own effort to develop complex text mining software for tens of languages.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an understanding of}} Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring</b> as a business intelligence system and how a multinational corporation can use these processes to complement existing traditional feedback processes. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the reader with a literature review of Social Media and Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and an exploratory study of Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring</b> practices within a multinational corporation looking to integrate these systems. The chosen research strategy is a case study with single-case embedded analysis. The case company used for this practice is Volvo Construction Equipment Region International with headquarters in Eskilstuna, Sweden. In order to receive a more in-depth understanding from our respondents, the qualitative method was selected. The theoretical framework chapter discusses five major research areas including Customer Relationship Management, Social Media and Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring,</b> Intelligence, knowledge management and organizational learning. The empirical evidence chapter has been divided into two sections: internal findings and external findings. The internal findings focus on Volvo Construction Equipment Region International and the company‟s current feedback process. The external findings focus on the comparison between Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring</b> companies. The analysis links together {{the internal and external}} findings from the empirical section and also draws references to the theoretical framework. The conclusion of this thesis states how a multinational corporation can add value to current feedback processes through the use of Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring.</b> This is reached through addressing the purpose of this thesis and answering the main research question and the sub research questions. Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring</b> can add value to current feedback processes through reducing time, fostering customer relationships, increasing flexibility, and receiving feedback from non-customers. Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring</b> when used effectively, can act as a complement to traditional customer feedback collection methods. Recommendations are made specifically for Volvo Construction Equipment Region International and are based upon an entry strategy with Social <b>Media</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Since this thesis was written within a limited time period, further research areas are presented {{at the end of the}} work...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we present a}} generic {{approach}} for summarizing clusters of multilingual news articles {{such as the ones}} produced by the <b>Europe</b> <b>Media</b> <b>Monitor</b> (EMM) system. Our approach uses robust statistical techniques as well as multilingual tools for named entity recognition and disambiguation to produce entity-centered summaries. We run experiments with the TAC 2008 and 2009 data sets (English corpora for summarization research), and we obtained very promising results; at TAC 2009 our runs attained top rank for linguistic quality and second best for overall responsiveness. We also run a small-scale evaluation on languages other than English, demonstrating thereby the multilinguality of our approach, but also providing interesting evidence that contradicts the pervasive assumption “if it works for English, it works for any language”. Finally, we present an online system currently under development which will eventually incorporate all the elements of the summarization approach discussed hereby and we show sample output summaries in various languages.
