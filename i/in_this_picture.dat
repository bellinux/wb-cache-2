5|$|He {{continued}} {{writing and}} eventually put together his first play, Removing All Doubt, which {{he sent to}} his old Syracuse theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote Hidden <b>in</b> <b>This</b> <b>Picture</b> which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. The contents of his first two plays got him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden <b>in</b> <b>This</b> <b>Picture</b> and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture.</b> The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture,</b> the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> Gleizes merges {{the sitter}} with the environment, {{blurring}} {{the distinction between}} background and foreground. In addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective, the artist has included {{the image of a}} clock in the upper left quadrant (as in Metzinger's Nu à la cheminée, Nude of 1910), a fact that reveals Gleizes' didactic visual and literary reference to the mathematician and philosopher of science Henri Poincaré, and to the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of 'duration'.|$|E
25|$|Ribera's oil {{painting}} of Saint Gregory the Great (c.1614) {{is from the}} Giustiniani collection. The painting is conserved in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. The face of Gregory is a caricature of the features described by John the Deacon: total baldness, outthrust chin, beak-like nose, whereas John had described partial baldness, a mildly protruding chin, slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> also Gregory has his monastic back on the world, which the real Gregory, despite his reclusive intent, was seldom allowed to have.|$|E
25|$|Two {{aspartate}} {{amino acid}} residues (below left) are interacting with two adjacent water molecules (w6 and w8) in the Mn2+ isocitrate porcine IDH complex to deprotonate the alcohol off the alpha-carbon atom. The oxidation of the alpha-C also takes place <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> where NAD+ accepts a hydride resulting in oxalosuccinate. Along with the sp3 to sp2 stereochemical change around the alpha-C, {{there is a}} ketone group that is formed form the alcohol group.

Here as in the later Walk on the Beach, the parasol is already an {{important}} prop. The open parasol casts shadows on her face, which is hidden by a veil in the later image. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> the painter has taken a slightly elevated position, so that no background horizon line is visible.

Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin's one-act play Hidden <b>in</b> <b>This</b> <b>Picture</b> and found out Sorkin also had a play called A Few Good Men that was having Off Broadway readings. Brown produced A Few Good Men on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre. It starred Tom Hulce and was directed by Don Scardino. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.|$|E
500|$|Whale met Franz Waxman at a {{party and}} asked him to score the picture. [...] "Nothing will be {{resolved}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> except the end destruction scene. Would you write an unresolved score for it?" [...] asked Whale. Waxman created three distinctive themes: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale's suggestion, with a powerful dissonant chord, intended to convey the idea that the on-screen explosion was so powerful that the theater where the film was being screened was affected by it. Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted 22 musicians to record the score in a single nine-hour session.|$|E
