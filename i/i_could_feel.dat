5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} itself {{received}} mostly unfavorable reviews, most critics praised the actingincluding Renoir's, {{and only the}} far right-wing press criticized Marcel Dalio's performance. In July 1939 a right-wing French newspaper criticized the film for portraying the Jewish Marquis married to the Austrian Christine. The Union Sacrée, a French clerical fascist group, organized demonstrations wherever the film was screened. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the Communist Party, which made him unpopular in the tense weeks before World War II began. Years later Renoir said [...] "there was no question of contrivance; my enemies {{had nothing to do}} with its failure. At every session I attended <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the unanimous disapproval of the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{completed}} the book while {{staying at the}} Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January 2007, and left a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room which read: [...] "J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11 January 2007". In a statement on her website, she said, [...] "I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric." [...] She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, [...] "a two-years' imaginative task". [...] "To which," [...] she added, [...] "I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles". She ended her message by saying [...] "Deathly Hallows is my favourite, {{and that is the}} most wonderful way to finish the series".|$|E

[...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like I got no panties on / I wish that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> ya / Now hurry, hang up that damn phone!'" [...] address the desire of an [...] "absent lover". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that its production was similar to that of [...] "Starships" [...] by Nicki Minaj.|$|E

500|$|After {{her time}} with her new friends at the retreat, Sarah Savage was optimistic. [...] "I left the retreat with a {{different}} outlook on life, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> my confidence growing, slowly." [...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview.

500|$|Streep {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian in Basking Ridge, New Jersey and {{attended}} Cedar Hill Elementary School and the Oak Street School, {{which was a}} Junior High school back then. In her Junior High debut, she starred as Lousie Heller in the play [...] "". In 1963 {{the family moved to}} Bernardsville, New Jersey, where she attended Bernards High School. Author Karina Longworth described her as a [...] "gawky kid with glasses and frizzy hair", yet noted that she liked to show off {{in front of the camera}} in family home movies from a young age. At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> through". She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended mass.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his heartbeat." ...|$|E

500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that [...] "as Chuck began laying out {{his plan to}} be freelance spies, and as Morgan took out the Intersect sunglasses General Beckman had so thoughtfully hidden in Chuck's going-away box, all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> was gratitude: I'm so glad NBC ordered one more season, because that is a show I want to see!" [...] Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story [...] "would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline [...] "would have sucked every last bit of joy out of the episode" [...] if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as [...] "Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out {{of a bunch of}} jarring personality shifts". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote," [...] The writers of Chuck sure know how to pull together a great finale. I was floored." [...] Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for a scene in which Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's [...] "practice wedding": [...] "These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kudrow {{was cast}} {{to play the}} role of Roz Doyle in Frasier, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the filming of the pilot episode. Kudrow said in 2000 that when rehearsals started, [...] "I knew it wasn't working. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it all {{slipping}} away, and I was panicking, which only made things worse". Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom Mad About You.

The transitional section that begins [...] "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" [...] of the Masser song has the same melody as [...] "I never thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" [...] of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated {{that he did not want}} people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{performance}} of MacHomer {{was at the}} Montreal Fringe Festival in 1995. At the time, the play [...] "was a very basic version with a few slides and me at a mike stand." [...] Miller began touring the following year. He has consistently changed parts of the play since its premiere. Until 2000, MacHomer was mainly a sketch comedy routine, but that year he expanded it into more of a theatrical production. The overhaul was Miller's effort [...] "to {{turn it into a}} play <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable touring the world with, as opposed to just playing the odd college." [...] In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. As of 2011, MacHomer is presented by WYRD Productions and directed by Sean Lynch. The lighting and stage design are by Beth Kates.|$|E
2500|$|After {{being asked}} in a 1988 {{interview}} about whether his music is or was religiously influenced, Brian referred to the 1962-published A Toehold on Zen, {{and said that he}} believed that he possessed what is called a [...] "toehold", defined metaphorically as [...] "any small step which allows one to move toward a greater goal". He elaborated: [...] "I learned from that book and from people who had a toehold on... say somebody had a grasp on life, a good grasp—they {{ought to be able to}} transfer that over to another thing." [...] During the recording of Pet Sounds, Brian held prayer meetings, later reflecting that [...] "God was with us the whole time we were doing [...] album ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that feeling in my brain." [...] In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a white spiritual sound, and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit.|$|E
