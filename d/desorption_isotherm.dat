The CO 2 adsorption and desorption attributes of CO 2 on dry Malaysian coals (Sarawak, volatile bituminous) were performed using a sorptomat apparatus (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics, USA) and BELSORP-mini II machine (BEL Japan, Inc.) at 273 K, 298 K and pressure up to 1 bar. The CO 2 adsorption was favourable at low temperature and dry coal conditions. However, S 3 and S 4 coals have the highest adsorption capacity by 0. 71 and 0. 73 mmol/g respectively. According to IUPAC classification of adsorption isotherms, CO 2 adsorption isotherm of all coal samples follow type I which most probably describe the adsorption limited to a few molecular layers (micropores). The results of adsorption and <b>desorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> demonstrate a positive hysteresis in all coal samples.

40|$|The water {{sorption}} isotherm {{of materials}} {{is of great}} importance to predict their durability. Many different methods {{are used in the}} literature to measure this water sorption isotherm. Chloride present in concrete elements/structures e. g. in marine exposure, can change the water sorption of the material. In this paper, the water sorption isotherm of a standard mortar with and without chloride is measured with a hygroscopic method. The chloride penetration into the sample is obtained by the vacuum saturation method. Subsequently the sample is placed in a glass vessel and dried. By injecting a known amount of water into the vessel, the water evaporates and is partly adsorbed by the sample until an equilibrium state is reached. With the known amount of the injected water into the vessel, the humidity inside the vessel and the volume of the vessel, one point of the adsorption isotherm is determined. For measuring the next point, more water is injected into the vessel. More points are measured in the same manner until the sample is saturated and with this the adsorption isotherm is completed. Afterwards, the measurement of the <b>desorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> starts with blowing dry air with a known flow, humidity and duration into the vessel. After reaching equilibrium, the first point of the desorption curve is measured. The next point is measured by blowing more dry air into the vessel. This continues until the sample is completely dry and with it the <b>desorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> is also completed...|$|E

We determined the long-term availability of soil P and evaluated the effectiveness of mining soil P to decrease P in different pools. There were two treatments: soil layers in the pots of either 5 or 10 cm thickness. Soils were analyzed at various stages of the experiment. Phosphorus in soil solution and the total pool of sorbed P were estimated using 1 : 10 (w/v) 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extracts and acid ammonium oxalate (Pox), respectively. A <b>desorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> was constructed, which described the relationship between P in soil solution and the total pool of sorbed P for the soils of the 5 - and 10 -cm treatments.

In the long-term, 65 % of Pox in the initial soil can be removed by plant uptake, as was calculated from the Langmuir equation and a critical P concentration in soil solution at which P uptake can just be maintained. Thus, Pox may be largely plant available. From the strong nonlinearity of the <b>desorption</b> <b>isotherm,</b> it can be understood why the relative decrease of the P concentration in the CaCl 2 extracts was much larger than the relative decrease of Pox.
