The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical <b>depths</b> are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical <b>depths</b> of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively.

40|$|Active <b>depth</b> cameras {{suffer from}} several limitations, which cause {{incomplete}} and noisy <b>depth</b> maps, and may consequently affect {{the performance of}} RGB-D Odometry. To address this issue, this paper presents a visual odometry method based on point and line features that leverages both measurements from a <b>depth</b> sensor and <b>depth</b> estimates from camera motion. <b>Depth</b> estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic <b>depth</b> estimation framework for both types of features {{to compensate for the}} lack of <b>depth</b> measurements and inaccurate feature <b>depth</b> associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating <b>depth</b> from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, <b>depth</b> measurements are exploited by propagating them through a <b>depth</b> map registration module and using a frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3 D-to- 2 D and 2 D-to- 3 D reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on large indoor and outdoor scenes, where <b>depth</b> sensor limitations are critical, show that the combination of <b>depth</b> measurements and estimates through our approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of <b>depth</b> measurements.

50|$|Case {{hardening}} is {{specified by}} hardness and case <b>depth.</b> The case <b>depth</b> {{can be specified}} in two ways: total case <b>depth</b> or effective case <b>depth.</b> The total case <b>depth</b> is the true <b>depth</b> of the case. For most alloys, the effective case <b>depth</b> is the <b>depth</b> of the case that has a hardness equivalent of HRC50; however, some alloys specify a different hardness (40-60 HRC) at effective case depth; this is checked on a Tukon microhardness tester. This value can be roughly approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however the chemical composition and hardenability can affect this approximation. If neither type of case <b>depth</b> is specified the total case <b>depth</b> is assumed.|$|R

5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean <b>depths.</b> These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure in the <b>depths</b> of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E

A sparse <b>depth</b> map is a <b>depth</b> map consisting of only a relatively few lines or areas which guides the production of the full <b>depth</b> map. Use of a sparse <b>depth</b> map can help overcome auto-generation limitations. For example, if a <b>depth</b> finding algorithm takes cues from image brightness an area of shadow in the foreground may be incorrectly assigned as background. This misassignment is overcome by assigning the shaded area a close value in the sparse <b>depth</b> map.|$|R

5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow <b>depths.</b> FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow <b>depths,</b> but banks formed at greater <b>depths</b> were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
