5000|$|Due to the {{advantages}} of diesel locomotives, railroads in North America had retired 90% of their steam locomotives by the mid-1950s. [...] Also, major cities and their railyards became unhappy neighbors in post-war America. People were no longer content to endure the large amounts of soot and smoke that coal burning steam engines produced. Early <b>diesels,</b> while <b>dirty</b> by today's standards, were a gigantic improvement in air pollution over steam.|$|R

Those teams included the St. Brawli Girls, <b>Dirty</b> <b>Diesel</b> Darlins, and Femmes Fatales. As of the 2012 season, the home teams had been dissolved.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the menace}} of coal smoke receded the society {{changed its name}} to the National Society for Clean Air, {{reflecting}} a broader focus on air pollution from traditional and emerging sources - including a successful campaign to outlaw stubble burning, crown immunity for incinerators, industrial pollution and transport (including lead in petrol, <b>dirty</b> <b>diesels,</b> low emission zones).|$|R
50|$|In Georgia {{the public}} {{transport}} {{system is not}} sufficiently developed. A {{significant proportion of the}} population uses private vehicles as the preferred mode of transport. The number of private vehicles has grown rapidly over the past decade and has almost doubled in the last five year period. Traffic has increased followed by industrial sources. The country has seen a sharp {{rise in the number of}} old, <b>dirty</b> <b>diesel</b> vehicles on the road over the last decade and pollution testing is virtually non-existent. WHO and IEA provides a data that shows Georgia having the most deaths attributed to air pollution, compared to other countries.|$|R
40|$|Contrary to claims from American politicians, lobbyists, {{and oil and}} gas executives, {{allowing}} {{energy development}} in the Alaskan Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) will harm the environment, compromise international law, erode the social significance of wilderness protection, and ultimately fail to␣increase the energy security of the United States. After exploring {{a brief history of}} the ANWR controversy, this piece argues that the operation of oil and gas refineries in ANWR will release discharged solids, drilling waste, and <b>dirty</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel into the ecosystem’s food-chain, as they have from oil operations in Prudhoe Bay. Less obvious but equally important, oil and gas exploration in ANWR will violate a number of international treaties on biodiversity protection. In the end, development in ANWR will threaten the concept of wilderness protection, and will do little to end US dependence on foreign sources of energy...|$|R

40|$|Comfort {{and safety}} of public transportation, {{particularly}} APTB PPD buses, becomes high expectations for its customers. Those expectations must be supported by {{the application of a}} good engine maintenance system. By using the method of Reliability Centered Maintenance may be determined appropriate actions to mitigate damage. From the analysis known the failures of the APTB PPD bus are malfunctions of the fuel engine, power transfer systems, difficulty to move the gear lever, and lubricating system for the rough engine noise. The cause of engine malfunction is <b>dirty</b> <b>diesel</b> filter, vehicle acceleration malfunction is due to the clutch plate wear out. Difficulty to move the gear lever indicates that the clutch slips. Rough engine noise caused by the flow of oil to the engine stalled as the result of dirty oil filter.

40|$|This paper {{assessed}} {{whether a}} right to sustainable energy services access {{can be found in}} international human rights law, possibly in support of achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal 7. According to SDG 7. 1, States are expected to strive for the implementation of "universal access to modern, affordable and reliable energy services" by 2030, while further aspirations on renewables and energy efficiency are included in SDG 7. 2 and 7. 3. The question of "sustainable" access to energy services raises in particular the question whether the "energy services" accessed by individuals and households in their home or in the community per definition need to be fuelled by some renewable energy source/technology, i. e. need to be 'environmentally-friendly'. This paper finds that, although concerns for health and life are certainly linked to the usage of (modern) energy services (or a lack thereof) in international human rights law, a clear direct recognition of the link between environmental-friendly usages of energy services and human rights is missing. In short, although international human rights law shows some recognition that the human rights to life and health are particularly relevant for healthy energy services access - particularly in respect of clean cooking facilities or <b>dirty</b> <b>diesel</b> generators - there is no "right to claim access to sustainable energy services" discernible in the human rights framework as such, so far. On the other hand, there is equally ample evidence that international human rights law framework offers protection to those living near environmentally-harmful energy production/generation plants - such as coal-fired electricity plants - which cause harmful air pollution and environmental living conditions. These people can mobilize human rights to call for (improved) State action towards cleaner air (and as related to this, take action to claim cleaner energy production where they live) ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{an active}} statewide California {{environmental}} justice organization, CBE {{has built a}} number of strategic alliances over its 34 years of work to work with partners that share a common vision of building power in marginalized communities. They are one of many organizations {{that make up the}} California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA), which organize in communities affected by pollution, working towards getting better protection for their community and environment. Over 35 community-based organizations, including CBE, make up the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) where they work towards the usage of sustainable energy in local communities. Grassroots Global Justice Alliance (GGJ), is made of various community groups including CBE, working with communities of color faced with the most environmental pollution and toxics. In regards to the expansion of the I-710, CBE and the Coalition for Environmental Health and Justice (CEHAJ) have worked together to create the Community Alternative 7 to improve the environmental conditions along I-710 corridor. CBE focuses on the people employed by toxic facilities and works with Don’t Waste LA, {{in order to create a}} proposal for community protection to further exposure. This proposal would require them to reduce toxic waste. [...] Green LA Coalition, Communities for a Better Environment, and other environmental justice groups, are focusing on LA in order to minimize the communities’ exposure to pollutants. In the chevron case CBE also worked alongside Asian Pacific Environmental Network to have Chevron's permit reviewed. [...] Local Clean Energy Alliance is made up of 70 organizations that call for renewable energy, pollutant reduction, and green jobs in California. It is also a member of the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative (BAEHC) working towards the reduction of pollution in vulnerable low income communities of color. CBE and Ditching <b>Dirty</b> <b>Diesel</b> work to bring awareness and advocacy on the issue of health problems and diesel pollution correlation. [...] CBE also has a partnership with Richmond Equitable Development Initiative’s to brainstorm activities which may increase the communities’ advocacy for a specific problem. [...] CBE has been a member of the Oakland Climate Action Coalition (OCAC), their efforts have allowed the inclusion of climate justice and health policies into the Oakland’s Climate Action Plan.|$|R
40|$|There is current {{interest}} in the impact of particles in fire smoke on the toxic hazards in fires and {{on the health of}} fire fighters. The exposure of people in fires to PM is over 1000 times that in ambient air and the role of breathing high PM in fires in fire deaths and impairment of escape from fires is unknown, as there are very few measurements of particle mass and size in fires. The exposure period would typically be 30 minutes and longer for fire fighters. The cone calorimeter is a standard piece of laboratory fire test equipment for heat release and smoke production measurements, by obscuration. It has been adapted by the authors to enable the measurement of toxic gas species using a heated Gasmet FTIR. This was used alongside the Cambustion DMS 500 particle size equipment to determine the particle size distribution. The FTIR measurements were made on the raw gas emissions from the chimney from the fire compartment and the DMS 500 measurements were on the diluted exhaust on the cone calorimeter. The experiments were carried out with an air box around the test specimen to simulate a compartment fire with a fixed ventilation rate. The ventilation rate used simulated an air starved fire typical of the conditions in a modern energy efficient house. The cone calorimeter was operated at 35 MW/m 2 radiant flux and the ignition delay was 29 s. The HRR was 90 kW/m 2 throughout the flaming combustion period. The combustion conditions were very rich with high CO and aldehyde emissions. The cone calorimeter dilutes the products from the chimney of the fire using ambient air and the dilution ratio was about 100 at the particulate measurement point. The particle size distribution showed a classic nuclei and cumulative mode distribution with the nuclei peak at 20 nm and the cumulative mode peak at 200 nm. There was a high 20 nm peak during the ignition delay, indicating a vaporised aerosol of high MW compounds from the wood, which were analysed using the FTIR. 20 nm Particles continued to be produced 1 x 1011 /cc for the 1400 s burning period of the pine wood samples and continued to be produced in the char burning phase. The 200 nm cumulative mode particles were produced at 1 x 109 /cc throughout the flaming combustion and then fell to < 1 x 108 /cc in the smouldering phase of the fire. The size distributions were quite different than those from biomass wood stoves and from modern diesels engines, although they had some similarity with old <b>dirty</b> <b>diesels</b> of the 1980 s. The FTIR analysis showed a large peak in CO (4 %) and THC (6 %) at around 800 – 1200 s in the fire. There was no equivalent dramatic change in the particle number in this time period, other than a small fall in the number of 20 nm particles and {{rise in the number of}} 200 nm particles. This work shows that fine particle emissions are likely to be a strong health effect in fires, as they are much higher than in diesel exhausts...|$|R
