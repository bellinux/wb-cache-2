40|$|Coral reef {{damage is}} {{unfortunately}} becoming {{a common occurrence}} off southeast Florida, U. S. A. Reattachment of the dislodged scleractinian corals usually initiates damage site restoration. Because mortality of dislodged colonies is typically high and natural recovery in southeast Florida is typically slow, transplantation of additional scleractinian corals into a damaged area {{has been used to}} accelerate reef recovery. Donor colonies available for transplantation have been grown in situ, grown in laboratories, and taken from nondamaged reef areas. An alternative source of donor colonies for transplantation into damaged sites is “corals of opportunity,” which we define as scleractinian corals that have been detached from the reef through natural processes or unknown events. This paper describes a project, initiated in 2001 in Broward County, Florida, that was developed to collect these dislodged colonies and transplant them to a coral nursery. Coral nurseries are <b>interim</b> <b>locations</b> that function as storage sites for corals of opportunity where they can be cached, stabilized, and allowed to grow, until needed as donor colonies for future restoration activities. This project is a partnership between a local university, county government, and a volunteer dive group.

Transplanted colony survival was similar to that of naturally attached control colonies and significantly greater than that of corals of opportunity left unattached. Results provide resource managers with information on the utility of using corals of opportunity as a source of transplant donor colonies, and the value of using coral nurseries to create a reserve of corals of opportunity for use in future coral reef restoration activities...|$|R

40|$|Coral reef {{degradation}} from ship groundings {{and construction}} activities is unfortunately becoming an increasingly common occurrence worldwide, especially in densely populated regions like southeast Florida, U. S. A., where each year {{there are a}} number of coral reef injury events that require mitigation and/or restoration. These activities generally begin with the rescue and reattachment (triage) of scleractinian corals dislodged during the injury event. Because dislodged colony mortality is typically high, colonies may die during legal enforcement action delays. Additionally, natural reef recovery in southeast Florida is typically slow; therefore, transplantation of additional (donor) scleractinian corals into an injured area has been used to restore natural species richness, percent cover, and density, which can accelerate reef recovery. Donor colonies available for transplantation have been grown in situ, grown in laboratories, and taken from uninjured reef areas. An alternative source of donor coral colonies for transplantation is “corals of opportunity,” which I define as scleractinian corals that have been detached from the reef through natural processes or unknown events. My thesis was part of a project, the Coral Nursery Project, initiated in 2001 in Broward County, Florida, U. S. A. that was developed to collect these dislodged colonies and transplant them to a coral nursery. Coral nurseries are <b>interim</b> <b>locations</b> that function as storage sites for corals of opportunity where they can be cached, stabilized, and allowed to grow until needed as donor colonies for future restoration activities. My thesis utilized a partnership between a local university, county government, and a volunteer dive group. Two hundred fifty-three corals of opportunity were located, collected, and transported to coral nurseries. Corals of opportunity were tagged, transplanted to the coral nurseries, and monitored quarterly for survivorship and growth from date of transplantation to February 2004. Survival of corals of opportunity transplanted to coral nurseries was found to be statistically similar to that of control corals naturally attached to reef, and significantly greater than that of control corals of opportunity left unattached. Growth rates of control corals naturally attached to reef were similar to that of corals of opportunity transplanted to coral nurseries. Results provide resource managers with information on the utility of using corals of opportunity as a source of transplant donor colonies, on coral species- and colony size-specific transplantation success, and on transplanted colony survival and growth. I discuss the value of using coral nurseries as cache sites for corals of opportunity to be used in future coral reef restoration activities, and provide recommendations for coral nursery characteristics for optimum coral survival, developing community-based restoration projects, and fostering participatory management. However, the ultimate goal of the Coral Nursery Project is to use these rescued corals of opportunity from this nursery as a source of donor coral transplants in future coral reef restoration activities. Stabilized and healthy transplanted corals of opportunity from this coral nursery will provide a living resource for coral transplantation during coral reef restoration projects. Corals of opportunity, coral nurseries, and integrated stakeholder involvement may become important tools in creating proactive coral reef management programs...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{material}} inventories {{are increasingly}} being transferred to <b>interim</b> storage <b>locations</b> where they may reside for extended periods of time. Use of a shipping package to store nuclear materials after the transfer has become more common {{for a variety of}} reasons. Shipping packages are robust and have a qualified pedigree for performance in normal operation and accident conditions but are only certified over an approved transportation window. The continued use of shipping packages to contain nuclear material during interim storage will result in reduced overall costs and reduced exposure to workers. However, the shipping package materials of construction must maintain integrity as specified by the safety basis of the storage facility throughout the storage period, which is typically well beyond the certified transportation window. In many ways, the certification processes required for interim storage of nuclear materials in shipping packages is similar to life extension programs required for dry cask storage systems for commercial nuclear fuels. The storage of spent nuclear fuel in dry cask storage systems is federally-regulated, and over 1500 individual dry casks have been in successful service up to 20 years in the US. The uncertainty in final disposition will likely require extended storage of this fuel well beyond initial license periods and perhaps multiple re-licenses may be needed. Thus, both the shipping packages and the dry cask storage systems require materials integrity assessments and assurance of continued satisfactory materials performance over times not considered in the original evaluation processes. Test programs for the shipping packages have been established to obtain aging data on materials of construction to demonstrate continued system integrity. The collective data may be coupled with similar data for the dry cask storage systems and used to support extending the service life of shipping packages in both transportation and storage...|$|R

40|$|K-Basin sludge will {{be stored}} in the Sludge Transport and Storage Containers (STSCs) at an <b>interim</b> storage <b>location</b> on Central Plateau before being treated and {{packaged}} for disposal. During the storage period, sludge in the STSCs may consolidate/agglomerate, potentially resulting in high-shear-strength material. The Sludge Treatment Project (STP) plans to use water jets to retrieve K-Basin sludge after the interim storage. STP has identified shear strength {{to be a key}} parameter that should be bounded to verify the operability and performance of sludge retrieval systems. Determining the range of sludge shear strength is important to gain high confidence that a water-jet retrieval system can mobilize stored K-Basin sludge from the STSCs. The shear strength measurements will provide a basis for bounding sludge properties for mobilization and erosion. Thus, {{it is also important to}} develop potential simulants to investigate these phenomena. Long-term sludge storage tests conducted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) show that high-uranium-content K-Basin sludge can self-cement and form a strong sludge with a bulk shear strength of up to 65 kPa. Some of this sludge has 'paste' and 'chunks' with shear strengths of approximately 3 - 5 kPa and 380 - 770 kPa, respectively. High-uranium-content sludge samples subjected to hydrothermal testing (e. g., 185 C, 10 hours) have been observed to form agglomerates with a shear strength up to 170 kPa. These high values were estimated by measured unconfined compressive strength (UCS) obtained with a pocket penetrometer. Due to its ease of use, it is anticipated that a pocket penetrometer will be used to acquire additional shear strength data from archived K-Basin sludge samples stored at the PNNL Radiochemical Processing Laboratory (RPL) hot cells. It is uncertain whether the pocket penetrometer provides accurate shear strength measurements of the material. To assess the bounding material strength and potential for erosion, it is important to compare the measured shear strength to penetrometer measurements and to develop a correlation (or correlations) between UCS measured by a pocket penetrometer and direct shear strength measurements for various homogeneous and heterogeneous simulants. This study developed 11 homogeneous simulants, whose shear strengths vary from 4 to 170 kPa. With these simulants, we developed correlations between UCS measured by a Geotest E- 280 pocket penetrometer and shear strength values measured by a Geonor H- 60 hand-held vane tester and a more sophisticated bench-top unit, the Haake M 5 rheometer. This was achieved with side-by-side measurements of the shear strength and UCS of the homogeneous simulants. The homogeneous simulants developed under this study consist of kaolin clay, plaster of Paris, and amorphous alumina CP- 5 with water. The simulants also include modeling clay. The shear strength of most of these simulants is sensitive to various factors, including the simulant size, the intensity of mixing, and the curing time, even with given concentrations of simulant components. Table S. 1 summarizes these 11 simulants and their shear strengths...|$|R
