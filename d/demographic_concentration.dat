50|$|The human {{occupation}} {{has been}} {{divided into three}} major periods (I, II and III) (Voigt and Dyson 1992). The earliest dating is uncertain but established as after 5000 BCE in the Chalcolithic period. This period (Hissar IA and IB) is characterized by mud-bricks buildings and hand-made (IA) and fine wheel-made (IB) ware, decorated with geometric, plant and animal patterns. The most widespread shapes are represented by small cups, bowls and vases. In the second period (Hissar IIA and IIB), dated to the 4th millennium BC {{and the beginning of}} the 3rd, the burnished grey ware becomes predominant and the large number of lapis lazuli beads and alabaster finds, as well as the evidence of large-scale production of copper-based alloys and lead-silver, suggests that the site was playing a very important role in the trade and export of metal artifacts and semi-precious stones from the Middle Asia quarries to Mesopotamia and Egypt. The third period of development (Hissar IIIA, IIIB and IIIC, chronologically attributed to the second half of the 3rd millennium BC {{and the beginning of the}} 2nd (Bronze Age), can be described as a proto-urban phase, mainly characterized by increased wealth, <b>demographic</b> <b>concentration,</b> mass production of plain ware and the construction of large public and ceremonial buildings. Among these, the Burned Building of Hissar IIIB phase is worth mentioning. It has been variously interpreted due to the richness of its contents and the presence of burned human bodies and flint arrowheads (Dyson 1972). Firstly interpreted as a fortification, the discovery of a small fire altar suggests that it may be a shrine (Dyson and Remsen 1989). Significant changes happened at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. The well-planned architecture of period Hissar IIIB was abandoned and replaced by the poorly organized structures of the Hissar IIIC period, laid out without regard to the plan of the earlier settlement. Moreover, we can mention the first appearance of truly elite burials, such as those of the so-called “Warriors”, the “Priest” and the “Little Girl” (Schmidt 1933), some of them contained BMAC items such as grooved stone columns.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the independent relationship between neighborhood context (characterized through age structure, economic conditions, service provision, and residential stability) and self-reported health among elders in one U.

Census and the Yellow Pages of the 1985 NewHaven, Connecticut, telephone book) and self-rated health among elders. We used survey data from the 1985 New Haven Established Pop-ulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, which comprised 1, 926 elders nested within 28 census tracts. Results. When controlled for individual age, gender, race, marital status, education, and income, neighborhood measures of percent poverty were positively associated with poor self-rated health (odds ratio [OR] 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 – 1. 17), whereas residential stability (OR 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 84 – 0. 96) and concentration of elders (OR 0. 82; 95 % CI 0. 72 – 0. 94) were inversely associated with poor self-rated health.

We describe the farming systems based on data collected over a year during monthly monitoring, with a sample of thirteen farms in three zones, selected from a larger survey of 160 farms in four zones. Data show the high complex¬ity of these farming systems for three main reasons: the multifunctionality of animal production, the high dependency of livestock on feeds produced on farm, and social factors such as skills and work management at farm level. Directly linked to this complexity, farm monitoring shows the huge challenge of development services in the face of local market uncertainty, the very lim¬ited access to land, future constraints in water management, and the little attractiveness of agriculture to young people.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{analysis}} of kinship among the Kuna of the San Blas Archipelago of eastern Panamá, {{which focuses on}} the creation of bodies and persons. San Blas island villages are characterized by a compact layout and a burgeoning <b>demographic</b> <b>concentration</b> in relation to space. Despite land is available on surrounding mainland areas, the Kuna continue living in nucleated villages, emphasizing kinship as the value of a life in spatial and social concentration. By describing quotidian life in one Kuna community, this thesis considers what it means to live in concentration from a Kuna perspective, and how wellbeing is created through daily practices and rituals aimed at contrasting the social disengagement, that people consider an effect of domestic splitting, the ramification of collateral ties, and illnesses inflicted by invisible pathogenic beings. My analysis focuses on two main lines of enquiry: 1) the progression of social relations from close to distant. Beginning from the house, where the bodies of co-residents are made consubstantial through commensality, the thesis analyses marriageability as the management of social distance, and the celebration of communal drinking festivals as the re-patterning of relations with different types of non-kin (e. g. non co-resident kin, the dead, and pathogenic spirits) for the regeneration of fertility and wellbeing. 2) It focuses on the person and discusses how adults make sense of babies and processes of body and kinship making in relation to non-human beings. By describing how ritual and micro-quotidian practices operate according to patterns of density and repetition, this thesis demonstrates that concentration and saturation are the core notions of sociality and personhood for the Kuna. The thesis argues that saturation is interior to the ongoing creation of kinship...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{civil wars}} are often {{characterized}} {{not only by}} fighting between rebels and governments, but also by rebel violence against their own community members. In spite of repeated peace negotiations, many of these conflicts seem to go on endlessly. Such instances may reflect attempts or failures {{on the part of}} the non-state side to consolidate. To confront the government on the battle field or at the negotiation table, rebels need to become an effective fighting force as well as effective negotiators. So, what do rebels do to consolidate to wage war and negotiate peace? The dissertation approaches the question of rebel capacity by disaggregating the non-state side in civil war and in connection with peace talks. The dissertation offers a set of original case studies from three ethno-separatist conflicts: Sri Lanka, Indonesian Aceh, and Senegal. It combines qualitative methods with one study also containing basic regression analysis. The empirical analysis reveals that the risk perceptions, information asymmetries, and commitment issues that often mark the relationship between the state and non-state parties are also prevalent within the non-state party. The overall argument is that rebels’ consolidation of their capacity to fight and negotiate entails different processes. More specifically, it first specifies conditions under which rebels use violence against members of their own ethnic community as part of the war against the government by emphasizing the importance of timing, territorial control, and ethnic <b>demographic</b> <b>concentration.</b> Second, it explores and highlights the importance of the rich repertoire of non-violent methods which rebels employ to enhance their fighting capacity. Third, it draws attention to the significant role of social network structures on the non-state side by empirically examining these structures, and their relationship to civil war dynamics and peace negotiations. Fourth, it sheds new light on pre-negotiation and ripeness theory by specifying the elements on the non-state side that need to be mobilized for a peace settlement, and what mobilization measures are used at what time. By furthering an understanding of the non-state side in civil war and peace processes, the dissertation helps third parties to engage more constructively in peacemaking, and humanitarian and development assistance...|$|E

IVF had the highest success rate overall and had a high pregnancy rate with oligospermia and asthenospermia. ICSI has a good outcome for those with azoospermia, severe oligospermia, and teratozoospermia. IUI must be tried as a first line treatment when semen concentration is more than 10 million sperm/ml. all are not significant (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: No significant differences were reported in the pregnancy outcome between various assisted reproductive techniques, smoking, type of infertility and medication...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between urinary cotinine and total 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL) concentrations in non-smoking staff and the indoor levels of fine particles (PM 2. 5) in hospitality venues that allow smoking, with respect to demographic and indoor environmental factors. We evaluated 62 hospitality venues that allowed smoking in Seoul, Korea. A real-time aerosol monitor was used to measure indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations. Field technicians recorded indoor environmental characteristics. One non-smoking staff member in each hospitality venue was tested for urinary cotinine and total NNAL <b>concentrations.</b> <b>Demographic</b> characteristics were obtained from self-reported staff questionnaires. Natural-log (ln) -transformed PM 2. 5 concentrations were significantly correlated with the ln-transformed cotinine (r = 0. 31) and the total NNAL concentrations (r = 0. 32). In multivariable regression analysis, the urinary cotinine concentrations of the staff members were significantly correlated with indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations; those with the highest concentrations were more likely to be women or staff members that worked in venues with a volume < 375 m 3. Total NNAL concentrations were significantly correlated only with indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations. Indoor PM 2. 5 may be used as an indicator for urinary cotinine and total NNAL concentrations in non-smoking staff members in hospitality venues that allow smoking...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCurrently, ambient {{pollutant}} concentrations at monitoring {{sites are}} routinely measured by local networks, such as AIRPARIF in Paris, France. Pollutant concentration fields are also simulated with regional-scale chemistry transport models such as CHIMERE ([URL] under air-quality forecasting platforms (e. g. Prev’Air [URL] or research projects. These data {{may be combined}} with more or less sophisticated techniques to provide a fairly good representation of pollutant concentration spatial gradients over urban areas. Here we focus on human exposure to atmospheric contaminants. Based on census data on population dynamics and <b>demographics,</b> modeled outdoor <b>concentrations</b> and infiltration of outdoor air-pollution indoors we have developed a population exposure model for ozone and PM 2. 5. A critical challenge {{in the field of}} population exposure modeling is model validation since personal exposure data are expensive and therefore, rare. However, recent research has made low cost mobile sensors fairly common and therefore personal exposure data should become more and more accessible. In view of planned cohort field-campaigns where such data will be available over the Paris region, we propose in the present study a statistical framework that makes the comparison between modeled and measured exposures meaningful. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate the exposure model by comparing modeled exposures to monitor data. The scientific question we address here is how to downscale modeled data that are estimated on the county population scale at the individual scale which is appropriate to the available measurements. To assess this question we developed a Bayesian hierarchical framework that assimilates actual individual data into population statistics and updates the probability estimate...|$|R
