5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes {{it out on the}} other workers, who resent <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and take her to a hospital ("Fantine's Arrest").|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{personal}} disputes arose {{within the}} Golden Dawn, which Farr described as an 'astral jar' between other senior members (Adepts), and a secret society within the Isis-Urania Lodge called The Sphere Group, created by Farr in 1896. There were also factions within the Order that resented a woman having authority as Chief Adept. Farr eventually believed that the temple should be closed down, writing to Mathers in January 1900 and offering her resignation as his representative, but that {{she was willing to}} carry on until a successor was found. Mathers' reply shocked and amazed <b>her,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> claimed that Westcott had committed fraud and forged some of the foundational documents and charters of the Order. After waiting a few days she consulted with Yeats, and they jointly wrote to Westcott requesting an explanation of, and a reply to, Mathers' charges. Westcott denied the charges, and a seven-member committee of Adepts was formed to further investigate Mathers, asking for proof. Mathers sent a belligerent reply, refusing to produce proof, asserting his authority and dismissing Farr from her position as his representative on 23 March. The Adepts in London continued their investigation, and subsequently expelled Mathers in 1901. Farr, Yeats and Horniman (who returned after having been expelled earlier by Mathers) attempted to reorganize the Order, but met with limited success. Farr remained in her Chief Adept position for a time, but resigned in January 1902 {{in the wake of a}} fraud scandal concerning associates of Mathers that exposed the once secret society to public ridicule.|$|E
500|$|This {{promotion}} saw Robbins {{become the}} only lesbian series regular on primetime TV. Robbins {{is described as}} [...] "quirky [...] perky" [...] by TV Guide Matt Mitovich, and [...] "a clear and rational surgeon who is not ruled by her emotions" [...] by Kris De Leon of BuddyTV. William Harper, writer of the episode [...] "Beat Your Heart Out" [...] in which Robbins and Torres kiss for the first time, has deemed Robbins: [...] "genuinely, positively interested in people, in the most selfless way." [...] Commenting on Robbins' confidence, Capshaw commented: [...] "she never thinks she's wrong and you don't hate <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> There's no ego though, she just always thinks she's right and she is." [...] She is portrayed as having [...] "wacky tendencies", including wearing roller shoes to work.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{controversial}} movie stars of her day, West encountered many problems, especially censorship. [...] She bucked the system, making comedy out of prudish conventional mores, and the Depression-era audience admired <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When her cinematic career ended, she wrote books and plays, and continued to perform in Las Vegas, in the United Kingdom, and on radio and television, and to record rock and roll albums. Asked about the various efforts to impede her career, West replied: [...] "I believe in censorship. I made a fortune out of it." [...] While true, she also suffered greatly because of it, even going to jail for her right to freedom of speech.|$|E

2500|$|Kilala {{travels to}} a new city to locate a professor, {{only to find that}} he's dead. She comes across a little girl, Mill, who's being bullied by {{teenagers}} accusing her for believing in fairies. Kilala tries to defend her, but ends up getting the book dirty, and Mill blames <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Later, however, Mill returns to thank her for the aid. As they talk about believing in fairies, Tinker Bell appears and lures them to an ancient library. There, Kilala finds a journal containing information about the Seventh Princess. Rei finds out Valdou {{is the leader of the}} Coup, the people responsible for attacking the kingdom of Paradiso. Rei is held captive as Valdou goes after the Tiara. Kilala enters a Princess Cinderella contest, only to fail at every single test and humiliates herself. She runs away in tears before running into Valdou, who [...] "takes" [...] her to Rei. Rei escapes Valdou's capture and finds Kilala.|$|E
2500|$|Vivian meets Cay Rivvers, a younger, free-spirited {{sculptor}} whom Frances loves as if {{she were}} her mother. Cay works at a casino as a change operator in Reno, and is ending a relationship with Darrell, her boss, because as she put it, she [...] "allowed (her)self to be attracted to his attraction" [...] for her. When Vivian arrives, Cay notices her immediately, and the tightly controlled and elegant Vivian, in turn, is taken aback by Cay's boldness and lack of concern of what others think of her (and her romantic/sexual preferences). Cay reveals that she has had relationships with women in the past. Frances jealously notices that Vivian is becoming a bigger and bigger part of Cay's life, and resents <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> afraid that Cay will leave her and the ranch, and she will be left alone. Frances sees Cay as her only [...] "family," [...] even though Cay is not her actual child, but rather the daughter of Frances' [...] "man" [...] Glenn who has been dead several years.|$|E
2500|$|Vanessa is {{described}} by the BBC as [...] "scheming", [...] "conniving and calculated". Ash called the role a [...] "meaty, hard part", explaining of her character: [...] "She's not had to work {{her way to the}} top and people resent <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> She's used her toughness all the way." [...] As part of the character's costume, she wears black, thick-rimmed glasses. Due to Ash's disability, Vanessa uses a walking stick. Ash commented: [...] "Disability is misrepresented on television and it's really fantastic that it did not worry the production team I was disabled." [...] Of Vanessa's backstory, Ash explained: [...] "She rose through the ranks from a nurse to become a CEO rather easily and we can only imagine that she’s done it by stepping over people along the way. But with a smile on her face." [...] With regards to Vanessa's nursing background and the difference it made to her position, Ash explained: [...] "They’re all so used to CEOs being very bureaucratic. I think it’s quite a shock to find someone who knows the medical side of things. They can’t get away with things, because she understands what’s going on." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Livadia {{could have}} been quickly {{repaired}} in a drydock, but none of world's docks was wide enough for her. The new drydock in Nikolaev, designed by Clark Stanfield specifically for the battleship Novgorod and the other popovkas, {{had not yet been}} expanded to fit the Livadia. Moored in Ferrol, Spain, for seven months, she became an easy prey for the journalists. The New York Times ridiculed the Livadia, her designers and her crowned patron: instead of blowing up the Livadia, the [...] "nihilists" [...] designed <b>her,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was hardly possible to conceive a worse ship. According to the anonymous satirist she was [...] "a yacht on board of which seasickness would be wholly unnecessary", [...] "a Nihilist device that no Nihilist would dream of destroying." [...] Instead of hunting terrorists, [...] "the English and Russian Police should seize the designer of the Livadia and hang him on the spot." [...] In November the newspaper changed its attitude, this time praising the Livadia for her stability on the high seas; the speed attained by [...] "an enormous iron turtle" [...] impressed the reporter who suggested that the Livadia [...] "may possibly lead to considerable changes in the art of ship-building." ...|$|E
