50|$|NIRA {{was created}} by the Ugandan {{parliament}} on 26 March 2015 in the law known as the Registration of Persons Act 2015. Before then, registration of personal vital data was gathered under various laws by different government agencies, including the Uganda Registration Services Bureau, the Electoral Commission, the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, the Uganda Revenue Authority, various local governments, and others. To harmonize and standardize the collection of personal identifying information of all citizens and legally resident non-citizens, the Ugandan parliament empowered NIRA to be solely responsible for and to share that data with other government agencies that may require that data. NIRA is also specifically charged with developing a National <b>Identification</b> <b>Register</b> of the county's citizens and legally resident non-citizens.|$|E

We followed 151 patients from 1996 to 2007 to investigate if microalbuminuria {{is a risk}} factor in coronary heart disease. All patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction in 1996 were included. At baseline, we recorded urinary albumin/creatinine concentration ratio, body mass index, blood pressure, left ventricle ejection fraction by echocardiography, smoking status, medication, diabetes, age, and gender. Deaths were traced in 2007 {{by means of the}} Danish Personal <b>Identification</b> <b>Register.</b> Microalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin/creatinine concentration ratio above 0. 65 mg/mmoL, occurred in 50 % of the patients and was associated with increased all-cause mortality. Thus, 68 % of the patients with microalbuminuria versus 48 % of the patients without microalbuminuria had died during the 10 years of follow-up (P= 0. 04). The crude hazard ratio for death associated with microalbuminuria was 1. 78 (CI: 1. 18 - 2. 68) (P= 0. 006), whereas the gender- and age-adjusted hazard ratio was 1. 71 (CI: 1. 03 - 2. 83) (P= 0. 04). We concluded that microalbuminuria in hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction is prognostic for increased long-term mortality. We recommend measurement of microalbuminuria to be included as a baseline risk factor in patients with acute myocardial infarction and in future trials in patients with cor-onary heart disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{vision of}} a {{spatially}} enabled government involves establishing an enabling infrastructure to facilitate use of place or location to organise information about activities of people and businesses, and about government actions, decisions and polices. Once the infrastructure is built, spatial enablement allows government information and services, business transactions and community activities to be linke d to places or locations. Given the potential of new technologies, use of place or location will facilitate the evaluation and analysis of both spatial and non-spatial relationships between people, business transactions and government. Most governments already have considerable infrastructure and administrative systems for better management of land and resources. Basic information creating processes are cadastral surveying that identifies land and running a digital cadastral database (DCDB) providing the spatial integrity and unique land parcel <b>identification,</b> <b>registering</b> land that supports simple land trading (buying, selling, mortgaging and leasing land); running land information systems (LIS); and geographic information systems (GIS) that provide mappin g and resource information.

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the {{coverage}} adjustment scheme is to compare the number of estimated positions {{with the number of}} <b>registered</b> <b>identifications</b> within the coverage of an identification sensor. If the approximated radius of an identification sensor is accurate enough, the number of the estimated positions is mostly equivalent to the number of the <b>registered</b> <b>identifications.</b> Otherwise, it means that the approximated coverage differs from the actual coverage. The radius of an identification sensor is adjusted by checking the difference between them. In some cases, the system needs to check the farthest or closet estimated position from the center of an identification sensor. For example, when the number of the estimated positions is equivalent to the number of the <b>registered</b> <b>identifications,</b> the coverage of an identification should be adjust to the farthest estimated position. Then, the problem in the coverage adjustment scheme is to determine how degree the radius is adjusted by at each sampling time. Since the coverage of an identification sensor can vary temporally, the large change of the radius may cause a reverse effect and the association performance may degenerate. Thus, we use the average speed of tracked objects measured by the association system as the degree of the radius adjustment to be unsusceptible to the object dynamics.|$|R
30|$|The data {{association}} and management scheme is proposed to complement {{two different types}} of signals in heterogeneous sensor environment. Visual sensors estimate and track positions of objects, and <b>identification</b> sensors <b>register</b> <b>identifications</b> of objects. The uncertain sensing coverage of an identification sensor is approximately modeled for a simple association strategy. The location information of identification sensors and objects is utilized to resolve the association problems with the object dynamics. We also present a coverage adjustment method using the object dynamics around the coverage of the identification sensor. The simulation-based analysis shows that the association performance is improved as the time elapses even with realistic problems such as error of estimated positions, a discrepancy between approximated and actual identification sensor overage, variance of actual identification sensor coverage, and imperfect tracking. To improve the association performance, the identification sensors should be installed at the places where objects dynamically move around for a fast association establishment or recovery, as the associations are established by the object dynamics of crossing the coverage of identification sensors.|$|R
