50|$|Simple CWP {{is marked}} by the {{presence}} of 1-2 mm nodular aggregations of anthracotic macrophages, supported by a fine collagen network, within the lungs. Those 1-2 mm in diameter are known as coal macules, with larger aggregations known as coal nodules. These structures occur most frequently around the initial site of coal dust accumulation — the upper regions of the lungs around respiratory bronchioles. The coal macule is the basic pathological feature of CWP and has a surrounding area of enlargement of the airspace, known as <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema.</b>|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{studies were}} {{used to examine the}} lungs from 92 persons who had died from brain and {{concomitant}} injuries and massive blood loss and from 117 experimental animals (rats) in systemic circulatory disorders and vascular thrombosis of the pulmonary microcirculatory bed. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the nature, intensity, and developmental periods of the morphological signs characterizing acute pulmonary lesion. Disorders of circulation (including microcirculation), damages to bronchial and bronchiolar mucosae, the development of atelectases, dyst-electases, and <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema</b> were found to be early structural changes in injury and massive blood loss. Pulmonary edema and the signs of a systemic inflammatory reactions form within the first hours following injury and massive blood loss.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder that is rarely found in Asians. Only four cases of CF from four different {{families have been}} reported in Taiwan. We report two cases of CF involving two teenage siblings. Both presented with repeated airway infections, poor weight gain, clubbing of the fingers, hypoxemia, and obstructive ventilatory impairment. Multiple <b>focal</b> bronchiectases and <b>emphysema</b> were demonstrated on high-resolution computed tomography. Sweat chloride concentrations, as measured using the modified sweat chloride test in a closed space with a heater, were 327 mmol/L and 276 mmol/L, respectively. To confirm the CF diagnosis, DNA mutation analysis was performed. All 27 exons of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (TR) gene and their flanking intron sequences were screened for nucleotide sequence alterations, and the mutations were then identified by direct DNA sequence analysis. Both siblings carried 1898 +SG→T; a mutation previously identified in Taiwan. In addition, the mutation analysis identified a new single-base-insertion mutation in exon 13 on the second CFTR allele of these patients. This mutation, named 2215 insG, is expected to cause a significant disruption of CFTR function. The 1898 +SG→T/ 2215 insG genotype is thus consistent with the CF diagnosis. A new missense mutation, S 895 N, in exon 15 of the CFTR gene, which cosegregated with 2215 insG, was also identified in both of these patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} aspects {{as well as}} the pathology, microbiology and serology of a natural Bovine Respiratory Syncytial (BRSV) infection of bovine in a herd of 600 beef cattle kept under extensive management in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, are described. Clinically two animals had chronic cough and severe dyspnea when forced to mild physical exercise. These two animals were euthanatized and post-morten examination was performed. The macroscopic changes were of pulmonary origin, such as disseminated alveolar <b>emphysema,</b> <b>focal</b> atelectasis and marked interlobular septal thickening. The fluorescent antibody test on lung cryostat sections was positive to BRSV for both animals, and it was negative to PI- 3 virus, BVDV and BHV. The BRSV was isolated from the lung of one of the animals on MDBK, and was also identified by fluorescent antibody test. No association with Chlamydia psittaci was found by ELISA performed on lung tissues. The histopathology showed syncytial cells, chronic emphysema, peribronchiolar muscle layer hypertrophy and squamous metaplasia of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia. The serology to detect antibodies to BRSV resulted in 79 % of positives from the first specimen collection. In this group of young animals some of them had a cough. The second samples collected 6 months later were from animals of different age groups resulting in 17. 3 % of positives. This is the first report on clinical BRSV infection in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|São descritas as manifestações clínicas, patológicas, microbiológicos e sorológicos da enfermidade natural causada pelo Vírus Respiratório Sincicial Bovino (BRSV) em uma criação extensiva de bovinos de corte no Rio Grande do Sul. Clinicamente havia tosse crônica e dispnéia intensa frente a exercícios físicos mínimos em dois animais. Os dois foram sacrificados e necropsiados. As alterações macroscópicas eram pulmonares com enfisema {{alveolar}} disseminado, focos de atelectasia e espessamento dos septos interlobulares. A imunofluorescência para BRSV em corte de pulmão congelado foi positiva em ambos os casos, sendo negativa para Parainfluenza- 3 (PI- 3), Diarréia Vírica Bovina (BVDV) e Rinotraqueíte Infecciosa Bovina (BHV). Foi isolado BRSV em cultivo celular de MDBK a partir de um dos animais necropsiados. Nenhuma associação foi detectada através de elisa para detecção de antígeno LPS gênero específico de Chlamydia psittaci no tecido pulmonar. O exame histopatológico evidenciou células sinciciais, enfisema crônico, hipertrofia da camada muscular peribronquiolar e metaplasia escamosa do epitélio bronquial e bronquiolar. O exame sorológico para BRSV evidenciou 79 % de soropositivos em uma primeira amostragem na qual havia animais jovens e alguns com tosse.

40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{chemicals}} and PM (particulate matter), including ultrafine particles (nanoparticles), mainly through inhalation. This creates a risk to their health. Another effect to exposure is expression of cytokines and their role in lung inflammation and morphpathogenesis. We conducted a pilot project based on testing of realistic exposure scenarios by describing morphological changes of the respiratory tract in Wistar rats (male) during a 30 -day exposure in office where there was high intensity of printing activities. Tracheal tissue of experimental animals had increasing concentrations of inflammatory interleukin IL- 1 and decreasing concentrations of IL- 6 and TNF-α. The lungs of the experimental animals tended to show focal infiltration of inflammatory cells, vascular plethora, focal and/or diffuse localisation of lymphatic nodules, and also vascular sclerosis and <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema.</b> The results suggested potential dangerous and adverse effect of poor indoor air quality (particles, including nanoparticles, and chemical compounds) on respiratory tract tissue of rats...|$|E
30|$|Unlike the {{previously}} {{reported cases of}} SCC presenting as GGNs, the present case is unique in that the patient had underlying pneumoconiosis. In the background lung, fibrosis, silicotic nodules, and macules which are characteristic of pneumoconiosis were identified. Also, <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema</b> {{was found in the}} background lung which seemed to secondary to smoking or pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis increases the risk of lung cancer, SCC being the most frequent type of associated lung cancer [11]. Inhalation of carcinogens {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of lung cancer [12]. It has been reported that SCC arising in patients with pneumoconiosis are significantly more frequently of the peripheral type than those in patients without pneumoconiosis. Peripheral-type SCC also arise preferentially in the lower lobes of patients with pneumoconiosis [11]. In the present case, given that the histologic tumor type was SCC and the tumor arose from a lower lobe, pneumoconiosis may have contributed to its development. SCC should be included in the differential diagnosis of peripherally located GGNs, especially in patients at high risk of SCC of the lung such as those with pneumoconiosis.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the nature and time of {{development}} of pulmonary and adrenal structural changes in early concomitant brain injury. Materials and methods. The lungs and adrenals from 120 persons who had died from severe concomitant brain injury were morphologically studied. Pulmonary and adrenal specimens were embedded in paraffin. Histological sections were stained in hematoxylin-eosin, by using the procedures developed by Weigert, van Gieson, and Mallory. The Schick test and other histochemical methods were used. Morphometric studies were also employed. Statistical processing used Student&# 8217;s t-test. Results. In injury, the early pulmonary structural changes were ascertained to be circulatory disorders, bronchial and bronchiolar mucosal damage, {{and the development of}} atelectases and <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema.</b> The morphological criteria for increased adrenal cortical functional activity are focal delipidization, diminished cortical transparency, the «spotty» appearance of the cortex, boundary-spanning between the cortical and reticular zones, multiple cytolysis, and iron plethora. Conclusion. Severe concomitant brain injury is followed by pulmonary structural changes underlying acute respiratory failure. Adrenal structural and functional changes {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of lung injury. Key words: severe concomitant brain injury, lung injury, adrenals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Silica {{nanoparticles}} (SNPs) {{are produced}} on an industrial scale and are {{an addition to}} {{a growing number of}} commercial products. SNPs also have great potential for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in medicine. Contrary to the well-studied crystalline micron-sized silica, relatively little information exists on the toxicity of its amorphous and nano-size forms. Because nanoparticles possess novel properties, kinetics and unusual bioactivity, their potential biological effects may differ greatly from those of micron-size bulk materials. In this review, we summarize the physico-chemical properties of the different nano-sized silica materials that can affect their interaction with biological systems, with a specific emphasis on inhalation exposure. We discuss recent in vitro and in vivo investigations into the toxicity of nanosilica, both crystalline and amorphous. Most of the in vitro studies of SNPs report results of cellular uptake, size- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity, increased reactive oxygen species levels and pro-inflammatory stimulation. Evidence from a limited number of in vivo studies demonstrates largely reversible lung inflammation, granuloma formation and <b>focal</b> <b>emphysema,</b> with no progressive lung fibrosis. Clearly, more research with standardized materials is needed to enable comparison of experimental data for the different forms of nanosilicas and to establish which physico-chemical properties are responsible for the observed toxicity of SNPs. </p...|$|E

The patient presented intense dyspnea, tachypnea (60 breaths per minute), bilateral reduction in the vesicular murmur and dif-fuse crackles. Oxygen saturation (SaO 2) while using 4 l/min of O 2 was 93 %, and no response at all was observed to treatment with inhaled beta agonists. The patient was administered clar-ithromycin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and dexamethasone, but his state quickly worsened with increased respiratory effort {{and the appearance of}} subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit of our pediatric hospi-tal. The child had been born full term with no postnatal complica-tions. He had been completely healthy up until this episode and had no family history of respiratory diseases. Upon examination, the patient continued to present dyspnea, and SaO 2 was 92 % with 7 l/min of O 2. Laboratory analysis showed mild anemia (10. 3 g/dl) and a high leukocyte count (18. 470 /mm 3 with 70 % of neutrophils). The C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin levels, electrolytes in blood, serum creatinine and liver function tests were normal. Thoracic radiography revealed thickening of the inter-stitial pattern, multiple radiotransparent areas due to the interstitial emphysema and parenchymatous opacities in the left middle and lower lung fields. Thoracic computed tomography revealed diffuse pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphy-sema (Fig. 1).
