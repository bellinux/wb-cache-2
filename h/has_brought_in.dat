25|$|Black sparrowhawks form monogamous pairs, though extra-pair matings are not uncommon. A nesting pair will mate {{regularly}} {{throughout the}} breeding season, starting during courtship and continuing till after the chicks have fledged. Once nest building or refurbishing starts the female becomes lethargic, {{and the male}} does nearly all the hunting and provisioning of the female and the chicks when they hatch. Typically, a pair will lay 2-4 eggs and incubate them for about 34–38 days until they hatch. Most of the incubating {{is done by the}} female, but the male will take over after he <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> prey. The female will then eat the food, and possibly bathe in a nearby stream, before taking over the incubation once again. This behavior persists into the brooding period, after which the female may also start to hunt for food, but only if the nest is left largely undisturbed by other predators. She remains the chief defender of the nest and the chicks. The newly hatched chicks are semialtricial in that they are fully covered in white down feathers but cannot leave the nest since they rely on the parents for food, warmth, and protection. After 37 to 50 days, the juveniles are fledged but the parents will continue to care for them for the next 37 to 47 days. The entire time from egg-laying to the juvenile independence can, therefore, be 20 weeks, or 5 months.|$|E
