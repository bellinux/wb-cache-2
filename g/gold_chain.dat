In recognition of their bravery, on 26 July 1875, the Governor of South Australia, Sir Anthony Musgrave, presented passengers James Fitzgerald and John Cleland and crewman Robert Brazil with gold medals and a gold watch. The Gothenburg Relief Fund Committee also presented each of them with a <b>gold</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring.

25|$|The Thetford Hoard (also {{known as}} the Thetford Treasure) is a hoard of Romano-British {{metalwork}} found by Arthur and Greta Brooks at Gallows Hill, near Thetford in Norfolk, England, in November 1979, and now in the British Museum. Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard {{is a collection of}} thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers, twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold amulet designed as a pendant, an unmounted engraved gem, four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr. A small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard.|$|E
25|$|Following Tiberius' {{death and}} the {{ascension}} of Agrippa's friend Caligula in 37, Agrippa was set free and made king of the territories of Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis, which his uncle Philip the Tetrarch had held, {{with the addition of}} Abila. Agrippa was also awarded the ornamenta praetoria and could use the title amicus caesaris ("friend of Caesar"). Caligula also presented him with a <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> equal in weight to the iron one he had worn in prison, which Agrippa dedicated to the Temple of Jerusalem on his return to his ancestral homeland. In 39, Agrippa returned to Rome, and brought about the banishment of his uncle, Herod Antipas; he was then granted his uncle's tetrarchy, consisting of Galilee and Peraea. This created a Jewish kingdom which did not include Judea at its center.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} magnetically controllable gold nanoparticles by synthesizing superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 core/gold shell nanoparticles.

Here we demonstrate dynamic and reversible self-assembly of the <b>gold</b> 1 D <b>chain</b> structures in an aqueous solution without any templates or physical or chemical attachment. The spatial configuration of <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> can be arbitrarily manipulated by controlling the direction of a magnetic field. This technique can provide arbitrary manipulation of <b>gold</b> 1 D <b>chains</b> for fabrication purpose.

50|$|The use of <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> in {{the film}} was {{reflective}} of hip hop culture and attire since rappers have constantly sported medallions and gold links around their necks since the 1980s. The spread of chains {{in the film}} {{was similar to that}} of the spread of crack and cocaine within the black community in New York during the 1980s as well. Too many <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> at once and a person could succumb to all of their jewelry, known in the film as an “overgold” or “OG”.|$|R
25|$|St. Paul's Chapel in New York City {{has a large}} oil {{painting}} of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, {{not long after the}} Congress of the Confederation began meeting in nearby Federal Hall. The painting hangs over Washington's pew, across the room from a painting of the arms of New York over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle, though, instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has a <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown.|$|E
25|$|At Framlingham Castle the Duke kept two silver-gilt cups {{engraved}} with {{the arms of}} James IV, which he bequeathed to Cardinal Wolsey in 1524. The Duke's descendants presented the College of Arms with a sword, a dagger and a turquoise ring in 1681. The family tradition was either that these items belonged to James IV or were arms carried by Thomas Howard at Flodden. The sword blade is signed by the maker Maestre Domingo of Toledo. There is some doubt whether the weapons are of the correct period. The Earl of Arundel was painted by Philip Fruytiers, following Anthony van Dyck's 1639 composition, with his ancestor's sword, gauntlet and helm from Flodden. Thomas Lord Darcy retrieved a powder flask belonging to James IV {{and gave it to}} Henry VIII. A cross with rubies and sapphires with a <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> worn by James and a hexagonal table-salt with the figure of St Andrews on the lid were given to Henry by James Stanley, Bishop of Ely.|$|E
25|$|Physically McKeag, like Johnny Adair, was shaven-headed, muscular {{and heavily}} tattooed {{and he wore}} a {{miniature}} golden gun around his neck on a thick <b>gold</b> <b>chain.</b> Maintaining a number of girlfriends simultaneously, McKeag fathered four children by four different women – two daughters both called Stephanie and two sons both called Stephen. In the case of one child, McKeag even delivered it himself after his Newtownards-based girlfriend broke her waters in his car, forcing him to pull into a petrol station to deliver the baby. One of McKeag's girlfriends was Jacqueline Newell who had previously been involved with Derek Adgey, a one-time member of the Royal Marines. Both Newell and Adgey were sentenced in 1995 for passing information about leading republicans including Brian Gillen and Alex Maskey to the UDA {{and it has been}} claimed that McKeag was their main point of contact with the organisation. McKeag was also dating Tracey Coulter, daughter of the UDA's Jackie Coulter, later murdered in a UDA/UVF feud.|$|E

25|$|During one {{of these}} sorties Robert Redhead a sutler had {{captured}} two very important Spanish prisoners; Cosimo d'Alexandrini and Pedro de Lugo a Commissary of the artillery. They had been captured {{not far from the}} North Fort by an English scouting party, Redhead was looking for items to sell to the troops inside when he stumbled across the Spanish officers checking the strength of the walls. The North Fort was a strong fortress which secured the entrance to Bergen op Zoom from the Scheldt on the north-east side. The two Spanish stayed as guests at the Lieutenant of the garrison's house belonging to William Grimstone and large bribes were offered to allow the Spanish into the North Gate. It was hoped that this would {{fall into the hands of}} Parma thus making the capture of Bergen a lot easier. Willoughby soon discovered this and by his orders pretended to give a ready consent to the proposal. As a ruse Grimstone pretended he was a staunch Catholic and were supporters of William Stanley the English turncoat. They secretly left the camp provided with letters from the two Spaniards to the Duke of Parma informing that everything was prepared for the admittance of the besiegers into the fort. On 6 October they soon met with Parma and were in conference - Parma obliged them to take an oath on the Sacrament that they were acting in good faith. Once this was done he gave them a large <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> and promised a large sum of money in the event of success.|$|E

It begins with Knowles showing cat-like eyes with leopard print make-up and fashion on.

The clip ends with Knowles pulling the oversized cat on a <b>gold</b> <b>chain</b> off set and just immediately after that, the music video for [...] "Green Light" [...] begins. Rohin Guha of BlackBook magazine described the video as [...] "deplorable". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "pure camp".
