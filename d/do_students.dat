MD and DO schools can also be distinguished by a relative lack of scientific and clinical research at DO schools. The coursework at MD and DO schools is similar, with the most notable exception being that <b>DO</b> <b>students</b> are taught osteopathic manipulative medicine.|$|E

25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student {{should know and be}} able to <b>do.</b> <b>Students</b> are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E

His 1956 short novel, A Single Pebble is the tale of a young American engineer traveling up the Yangtze on a river junk during the 1920s and discovering that his romantic concepts of China bring disaster.

30|$|The {{findings}} in this paper lead to interesting avenues of future research. If teachers behave strategically, the next step should be to investigate the impact of tenure on student achievement. The primary limitation to {{this study is that}} it does not establish the link between teacher behavior and student achievement. For example, <b>does</b> <b>student</b> achievement noticeably improve in the year that a teacher is being evaluated for tenure? If teachers are spending more of their own money on classroom materials and spending more time communicating with students and parents, then students’ academic performance may improve. Consequently, <b>does</b> <b>student</b> performance decline in the year immediately following tenure? Since total work hours remain unchanged after tenure, a teacher’s reallocation of time towards certain extracurricular activities may provide insight into the link between teacher activities and student achievement.|$|R
