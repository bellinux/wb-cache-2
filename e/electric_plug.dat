2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] <b>electric</b> <b>plug,</b> and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment."

50|$|Collins was {{a strong}} believer in the {{capitalist}} system and he insisted that Reddy would be licensed only to publicly traded, tax-paying utility companies. Following World War II Collins became increasingly concerned about the spread of government and cooperative-run electric companies. The Reddy Kilowatt Service began producing ads that equated such organizations with the spread of socialism. In 1950, he created the Grass Roots Impact Plan to advance the promotion of this theme.Collins was convinced {{of the importance of}} delivering his pro-capitalist message to young audiences, encouraging Reddy Kilowatt licensees to launch youth clubs in the late 1940s. In the middle of the dissent-filled 60s he developed a comprehensive education program to teach young people capitalist economic values. A supporting slide presentation, aimed at executives, called “Fission, Fertility, and the Future” emphasized the importance of reaching youth during times of social upheaval {{in order to protect the}} interests of investor-owned utilities.In 1956, Collins took aim at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, an association of cooperative-owned utilities. Members of that organization, unable to license the Reddy Kilowatt service mark, created their own in 1952. The Willie Wiredhand character featured a body of electric cable with <b>electric</b> <b>plug</b> feet. Reddy Kilowatt, Inc. filed suit against the cooperatives but on January 7, 1957 the court ruled the characters were different and dismissed the complaint.|$|E
5000|$|Rushton had {{not been}} {{involved}} in Private Eye since {{the latter part of}} the 1960s, other than a brief stint illustrating [...] "Mrs Wilsons Diary" [...] when the Labour Party came back into power in the mid-1970s. He returned to Private Eye in 1978 to take over the task of illustrating [...] "Auberon Waughs Diary", which continued until 1986. The cartoons perfectly complemented Auberon Waughs scabrous and surreal flights of invective, and when Waugh moved his column to The Daily Telegraph as the [...] "Way of the World" [...] in 1990, Rushton followed. The Victoria and Albert Museum, recognising his accomplishments, commissioned 24 large colour illustrations that were collected as Willie Rushtons Great Moments of History. (Rushton had previous experience with the V&A when he had pulled a prank on the institution by labelling an <b>electric</b> <b>plug</b> socket in one of the galleries: [...] "Plug hole designed by Hans Plug (b. 1908)", which remained for a full year - to the great annoyance of a cleaner who had to use a hefty extension lead for 12 months so as not to damage the exhibit.) This large scale excursion into the use of colour was good practice for the monthly colour covers he created for the Literary Review when Waugh became its editor in the late 1980s. Rushton drew these covers along with the fortnightly caricatures for Private Eyes literary review page until his death.|$|E

Our solution requires no interaction with home users: in particular, it does not require them to express their energy demand in advance. A queuing theory model is derived to quantify how many users should adopt this solution in order to control a significant aggregated power load without significantly impairing their quality of service...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, {{the north}} side elevator was finally completed. With the elevators freed from the need to carry construction materials and workmen, the tower was finally opened to the public. A number of exterior projects remained, however: granite facing for the upper terrace walls, bronze trim for the main doors, bronze lighting standards for the portico, granite facing for the lower terrace walls, and granite facing for {{the back of the}} auditorium. Some interior work was also needed. For example, holes had been drilled in the marble floor of the memorial hall so that <b>electric</b> <b>plugs</b> could be installed for lighting fixtures. The unassigned seventh floor finally found a sponsor as well. That year, the Grand Central Council of Cryptic Masonry agreed to sponsor the floor, and by year's end had raised half the funds necessary to complete and furnish the floor.|$|R
