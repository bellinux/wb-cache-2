25|$|Both Chilean men {{and women}} qualify for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if they have {{dependent}} {{children under the age}} of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> since a man qualifies for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if he has a dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage. A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to child support payments.|$|E

Although several {{studies have examined the}} relationship between cash benefits and fertility, few studies have addressed the possible differential effects of cash benefits on families of different income or education levels. I reconstructed the birth histories of women in the past two Israeli censuses of 1983 and 1995 to study socioeconomic {{differences in the}} effect of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> up to the seventh parity. The results indicate that <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> have a significant effect at every parity. Using female education as an indicator of socioeconomic status, I find that socioeconomic status is a significant modifier of the effect of <b>family</b> <b>allowances.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>allowances</b> seem to have a relatively large impact on more-educated women...|$|R

2500|$|In social policy, {{temporary}} measures {{were introduced in}} December 1946 entitling wage-earners to an allowance {{for the first and}} second child under the age of 18. The Old Age Pensions Emergency Provisions Act of May 1947 provided means-tested pensions for all persons over the age of 65 regardless of the previous employment record, and the Pensioners’ Family Allowances Act of July 1948 introduced <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> for those in receipt of invalidity, old age, or survivors’ benefits “according to the Invalidity Insurance Act 1919.” ...|$|E

Polly found he had only three real interests, all acquired at Harvard: to play, to drink, and to turn out, at any hour, to chase after fire engines and watch buildings burn.

2500|$|Eventually, Alice {{received}} a suspended sentence {{of six months}} in prison and a fine of 100 francs (approximately 4 U.S. dollars) by the Paris Correctional Court, who rebuked de Trafford for his failure to deliver his promise to marry her, {{out of fear of}} losing the <b>family</b> <b>allowance.</b> Although it was criticized by some newspapers, this lenient decision may have been influenced by the revelation concerning Alice's frequent suicide attempts, de Trafford's taking responsibility for her state of mind, and the public's sympathetic view of her as the tragic victim of a true crime of passion. Even the prosecuting attorney insisted upon leniency and declared that [...] "I should not like to bear de Trafford's responsibility for a broken heart and a disrupted home".|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Sewell {{states that}} [...] "On {{the day the}} House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author {{slipped out of the}} gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House. ... His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect. ... The idea of child {{allowances}} had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, {{to limit the number of}} children born to poor households. [...] For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents. ... The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a flat rate of child allowance. But Beveridge alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the flat rate would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists. 'Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that [...] graded <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his flat rate scheme,' reported the Eugenics Review.|$|E

40|$|The first {{significant}} GATT case regarding {{the principle of}} trade discrimination was Belgian <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances,</b> a complaint by Denmark and Norway against Belgium. This 1952 decision expounding {{the meaning of the}} unconditional most-favoured-nation principle is often cited for the proposition that origin-based conditions are inconsistent with that core principle. This article reconsiders <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> through the window of Professor Hudec s classic case study written in 1975. In particular, the article considers whether the panel and Professor Hudec correctly interpreted the term unconditionally, in light of the pre- 1947 international trade law practices. In addition, the article explores the status of <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> as the first GATT case holding that a governmental social program violated trade rules. Although Belgium did not invoke GATT Article XX as a defense, this paper assesses how current WTO jurisprudence would be applied to the facts in <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances,</b> and concludes that Belgium would still lose the case. ...|$|R
