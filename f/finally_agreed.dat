5|$|Marian <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to {{play the}} part of Süß for fear of {{reprisal}} against members of his family. Marian had a daughter {{from his first marriage}} to the Jewish pianist, Irene Saager. The former husband of his second wife was also Jewish, making her son (and Marian's stepson) half-Jewish.|$|E
5|$|This dilemma was {{to result}} in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel's {{negotiations}} with the Bristol Dock Board dragged on for months.

5|$|During the Northern Seven Years' War, {{attacks were}} {{launched}} on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569.

Booker-McConnell paid her approximately £85,000 for the rights to the 17 Heyer titles owned by the company. This amount was taxed at the lower capital transfer rate, rather than the higher income tax rate.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Disney {{executives}} {{wanted to}} set the film in contemporary times, out of concern that a period piece might not appeal to a large audience. Bilson and DeMeo argued {{that the success of}} the Indiana Jones trilogy proved that ticketgoers would enjoy an adventure film set in the 1930s, and the studio <b>finally</b> <b>agreed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Katharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City, {{a former}} Oberlin classmate, in 1926. Orville was furious and inconsolable, feeling {{he had been}} betrayed by Katharine.

5|$|Allcroft's {{descendants}} {{fell into}} financial difficulties {{during the early}} 20th century, however, and it became increasingly {{difficult for them to}} cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately.

5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again {{seen in the}} run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to play.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E
5|$|Radio City Music Hall's {{management}} {{refused to}} screen Citizen Kane for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that The American Weekly would run a defamatory {{story on the}} grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit {{if they did not}} release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to release the film on May 1.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic-Republicans in Congress held a nominating caucus {{and named}} Jefferson and Aaron Burr as their presidential choices. Jefferson at first {{declined}} the nomination, but he <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to run a}} few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and Thomas Pinckney as their candidates for president. The campaign, was, for the most part, unorganized and sporadic, confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets and political rallies; of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E

5|$|The South Tower was {{completed}} in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold. Because of the occupancy rate and low profits so far, the developers had initially refused to pay $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the South of Market area. However, the developers <b>finally</b> <b>agreed</b> to pay the city.|$|E
