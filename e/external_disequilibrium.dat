Years 1994 - 1995 are viewed as a period of high economic growth and rate of investments combined with growing <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> which manifested itself in deteriorating balance of trade. Maintaining fixed exchange rate and liberalization of capital flows helped to create a speculative "bubble" which finally led to speculative attack on crown. The role of monetary policy is discussed in context of the government "packages" in spring 1997 which were aimed at maintaining the balanced government budget. The exchange rate crisis is viewed as a dramatic episode which showed {{how easy it is}} for speculators to shatter the fragile equilibrium of an economy in transition.

40|$|A {{systematic}} analysis is presented {{of the economic}} consequences of the abnormally high concentration of Zambia's exports on a commodity whose price is exceptionally unstable. Zambian macro-economic variables in the post-independence years are extensively documented, showing acute instability and decline, particularly after the energy price revolution {{and the collapse of}} copper prices. The relevance of stabilization policies designed to correct short-term disequilibrium is questioned. It is, therefore, a pathological case study of externally induced economic instability, complementing other studies in this area which use cross-country analysis of a few selected variables. After a survey of theory and issues pertaining to development, finance and stabilization, the emergence of domestic and foreign financial constraints on the Zambian economy is described. The world copper industry is surveyed and an examination of commodity and world trade prices concludes that copper showed the highest degree of price instability. Specific aspects of Zambia's economy identified for detailed analysis include: its unprofitable mining industry, <b>external</b> payments <b>disequilibrium,</b> a constrained government budget, potentially inflationary monetary growth, and external indebtedness. International comparisons are used extensively, but major copper exporters are subjected to closer scrutiny. An appraisal of policy options concludes the study...|$|R

It tries to define an optimal mix between <b>external</b> and internal <b>disequilibrium</b> and to apply this concept {{to the analysis of}} the Romanian economy. The forced adjustment of the balance of payments in the 1980 s is presented as a prologue to the scrutiny of transformation policy underway; results and dilemmas of macro-stabilization are dealt with in this respect. The paper ends by providing some insights into the problematique of understanding (dis) equilibria in transforming economies.

The author {{deals with the}} problem of this disequilibrium and looking for answer to the question: {{how to get out of}} it? The answer is directed to change of goals of macroeconomic policy towards formation and change of existing structure and size of aggregate demand or consumption. In looking and finding adequate answer, the author comes to foreign tourist consumption which he observes as a part of aggregate consumption of Croatia. He analyses tourist consumption and foreign exchange inflow of tourism and evaluates what would be the influence of tourist services at the level of gross domestic product, especially on balance of payments and negative balance coverage. In this way Croatia will more expose itself towards world and open market and turn its present expressively negative trends in positive direction. Exactly tourism is a strong factor for aggregate consumption increase and creation of open economy. The author expounds its researches on possible effects of foreign tourist consumption which rely upon real pressumptions of tourist consumption development and realizable foreign overnights which Croatia had already realized through its potentials. Recognition of tourist national product as strategic product and tourist consumption, leads Croatia and its economy from vicious circle of poverty to welfare world...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the business cycle phenoma. First part is theoretical and is focused on characteristics of business cycles, especially on investigating causes of economic fluctuations (demand and supply shocks), types, phases, and history of business cycles. Then, monitoring and analysis of business cycle follow, when the indicators of internal and <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> is to analysed. From indicators of the internal disequilibrium a very special focus is put on inflation rate, difference between real output and potential output (output gap), and unemployment rate. <b>External</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> is analysed through the current account balance {{as a percentage of}} GDP. Next chapter of the theoretical part is dedicated to aggregate demand and its components, aggregate supply and macroeconomic (dis) equilibrium. In this work the attention is paid to both fiscal and monetary policy, which can substantially influence length and behaviour of a business cycle. Second part is analytical and addresses business cycle in the economy of Germany since its reunification (1990) to 2006. This time period is separated into several parts. Every part is specific and will be analysed separately. Selected macroeconomic indicators are also to analysed by econometric models, and then their influence on the behaviour of the business cycle is evaluated. In conclusion, a broad prospect of the future business cycle development is outlined...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between public debt, <b>external</b> and internal <b>disequilibrium</b> and inflation in Hungary through changes {{in the public sector}} borrowing requirement and in the structure of budget financing. The analysis is based on data from the 1986 - 1997 period in order to put the changes in true perspective. Policy constraints stemming from high indebtedness and their macroeconomic consequences are analysed by comparing different measures of fiscal deficit, as well as by quantifying the factors determining the evolution of the public debt/GDP ratio. We focus on the operational deficit (which is derived from the nominal deficit by eliminating the inflation compensation component of interest payments) and on its financing. The study presents a detailed empirical analysis of the evolution of the financing structure (seigniorage - debt) {{as well as of the}} role and structural changes of debt financing. The calculations are based on net consolidated public debt, which includes the combined debt of the budget and the central bank to other sectors net of claims. The consolidation of budget and central bank balances is unavoidable in order to get reliable indicators of the fiscal stance since in Hungary the central bank has been responsible for borrowing abroad in its own name. We introduced the category of ?extended??consolidated public debt (including the stock of central bank’s sterilisation instruments) which enabled us to analyse the past eleven years in a consistent framework, and to reveal the trends as well as the dynamic relationships of the debt accumulation process. The analysis shows that the shift to a new regime of deficit financing based on issuing marketable government securities (in 1992) did not increase the fiscal burden, it merely revealed its true magnitude by separating monetary and fiscal functions and by increasing transparency. The analysis of consolidated debt revealed that throughout the last ten years the implicit real interest rates on public debt exceeded the growth rate of the economy, which led to the continuous increase of the debt ratio (the gross debt/GDP around 90 % in the middle of nineties). This effect was mitigated only from 1995 by the fiscal adjustment resulting a primary surplus in the budget. The seigniorage did not play an important role in financing after 1992, it amounted to 1 - 2 % of GDP. However, the major element in the significant (over 15 percentage points) reduction in the debt-to- GDP ratio over the last three years was the devotion of privatisation revenues to retire public debt. Analysing past developments, we came to the conclusion that despite the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the last few years, the debt burden is still significant and a further reduction of the debt to GDP ratio is inevitable in order to create the conditions for sustainable growth and to ensure the continuous convergence to developed countries. This requires a structural primary surplus of 1. 5 - 2 % of GDP in the medium run, if we take into account the requirement of sustainability, the goal of further reductions in the inflation rate and the fact that with the end of the privatisation process privatisation revenues will not provide additional sources for financing. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade Romania’s trade balance {{experienced}} substantial deficits. This <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> which affected the macroeconomic stability could be ameliorated by increasing the exports. Romania’s adhesion to the European Union in January 2007 created new opportunities for the exporters. However, in the new circumstances, the Romanian authorities {{are not allowed to}} apply the classical tools of the trade policy, such as subsidies or tax decrease, in order to stimulate the exports. Instead, assistance consisting in consultancy and facilities could be offered to the exporters for a better communication with foreign partners. Understanding the exporters’ motivation could be useful in such assistance. In this paper we approach the Romanian exporters’ perceptions about their activity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{examination}} of the relationship between fiscal and Current Account balances for the countries of southern eurozone. The twin deficit hypothesis is tested within the context of a portfolio model involving variables from the financial sector. Empirical analysis is conducted with panel data, for the period 1991 - 2011. Evidence is provided to support the twin deficit hypothesis. Additionally, it is found that it is not only the fiscal policy of the southern eurozone countries that affects their Current Account balances, but also the fiscal policy of the eurozone surplus countries of the north. Interdependence of euro-zone countries suggests that fiscal policy can be used for the elimination of <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> Therefore, fiscal policy should be coordinated but not uniformly applied...|$|E
40|$|Most Western {{economists and}} policy makers agree that the Yuan is {{significantly}} undervalued and push the Chinese government for a large nominal revaluation of the Yuan. This paper, while surveying recent research on Chinese exchange rate policy, gives some new insights into this issue. Notably, this paper defends that China is not solely responsible for the Yuan’s undervaluation, the Chinese central bank cannot optimally invest an increasing amount of foreign currency reserves, and the Yuan’s nominal revaluation {{is not the only}} way to resolve the problem. After having analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of a nominal versus a real revaluation of the Yuan for the Chinese economy, I advocate and analyze, besides a modest nominal revaluation, a multitude of alternative policies to achieve a complete revaluation of the Yuan in real terms, which allows absorbing <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> while laying down the foundation for the long-term growth of the Chinese economy. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} structuralist ideas are {{particularly}} useful for discussing global growth in times of crisis. Three are the main points of the paper. The first one is that specific policies for promoting structural change in the periphery at both the domestic and international levels are necessary for increasing {{the participation of the}} periphery in world trade. Automatic or implicit reciprocity ensures that more exports from the periphery will lead to more imports, and thereby neither growth nor exports would suffer in the centre. In addition, we stress the inter-relation and complementarities between fiscal policies and industrial and technology policies aimed to promote structural change in the periphery. The two policies should be combined to avoid <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> and protectionist responses. And finally, we suggest that major efforts for institution building and international coordination are required to avoid an escalation of protectionist measures in the international system...|$|E
40|$|From {{the outset}} of {{transition}} Croatia faces a serious problem of external imbalance {{as a consequence of}} unfinished structural and institutional reforms. The external balance crisis can be seen through raising international trade deficit and structural characteristics of trade flows. To these unfavorable characteristics belong export reorientation from developed to less developed countries, increasing number of industries in which Croatia has position of net-importer and export structure in which dominate low-value-added products. Increasing trade deficit in 2001 and 2002 followed by further growth in external indebtedness cause increasing burden of debt service and limit the possibilities for economic growth. Taking all this as well as real limits in further external imbalance growth into consideration {{it can be said that}} Croatia realizes high level of <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> In contrast, advanced transition countries achieve fairly good and stabile external positions thanks to successful economic restructuring and strong export growth...|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium in the {{transition}} economy of Bulgaria is discussed {{on the basis of}} the IS - LM - BP model, and the conditions affecting its variables are identified. An approach in macroeconomic policy is offered, through which it is possible to make the economic mechanism more market-oriented. The factors affecting the formation of the IS, LM and BP curves are analyzed. It is argued that in order to overcome disequilibrium in the economy, a suitable instrument can be the mixed monetary-fiscal policy, suggested by the concept, known as the Mundell-Fleming model. Neither of those policies, applied individually in order to cure the unbalanced economy is able to offer a solution, while the two of them used simultaneously, can produce such an effect that deficiencies in either of them can be offset by the other, since in order to counteract internal disequilibrium, an expansive fiscal policy will be used, and in order to counteract the <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> - a restrictive monetary policy. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>external</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in Brazil is sketched, the 1979 maxidevalu-ation is discussed, and a {{well-known}} result of open macroeconomic theory is restated, that is, {{that the cost}} of a successful devaluation is a reduction in real wages. Whenever real or relative wages are resistant, a devaluation quickly washes out. THE ECONOMY High rates of inflation and a large and growing external debt are the most serious problems that Brazil faces nowadays. During the last 30 years (1950 - 79), the average rate of inflation in Brazil has been 32 percent annually. Macro-economic theory predicts that inflation rates tend to become rigid once govern-ment adopts accommodating policies in relation to supply and demand shocks, and relative wage stickness makes economic recessions inefficient as a means of reducing inflation. Hence, although inflation rates vary over the business cycles, {{at the end of each}} of them they are higher than before.
