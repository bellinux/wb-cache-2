50|$|The {{name of the}} practice, when it is done in a {{repeated}} <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion,</b> is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a tea bag into {{a cup of hot}} water as a method of brewing tea. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay. The practice may also be performed during sexual assault.|$|E
50|$|Self-adjusting files is {{a general}} term for hollow, {{compressible}} files made of nickel-titanium that adapt three-dimensionally {{to the shape of}} a given root canal, including its cross section. The files are operated with vibratory <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion,</b> with continuous irrigation of disinfectant delivered by a peristaltic pump through the hollow file. A uniform layer of dentin is removed from the whole circumference of the root canal, thus achieving the main goals of root canal treatment while preserving the remaining root dentin. The 3D scrubbing effect of the file, combined with the fresh irrigant, result in clean canals, which in turn facilitate better obturation. More effective disinfection of flat-oval root canals is another goal that is simultaneously attained.|$|E
50|$|Shaving soap {{in a cup}} is {{traditionally}} lathered and applied using a rotating <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion</b> of a shaving brush, usually made of boar or badger bristles. The shave is completed using as few strokes as possible, stropping sparingly if at all. A second shave with another razor in an alternate direction against the beard yields an extremely close shave. Rinsing with cold water constricts minor abrasions or cuts, followed by patting dry (not rubbing) and an astringent or aftershave lotion. More serious nicks can be attended with direct pressure for perhaps a minute with a styptic pencil, or with an application of a household astringent such as witch hazel. A light steady touch is most effective at providing a close shave, preserving the edge and avoiding cuts.|$|E
40|$|We study strong-gravity {{effects on}} {{modulation}} of radiation emerging from accreting compact objects {{as a possible}} mechanism for flux modulation in QPOs. We construct a toy model of an oscillating torus in the slender approximation assuming thermal bremsstrahlung for the intrinsic emissivity of the medium and we compute observed (predicted) radiation signal including contribution of indirect (higher-order) images and caustics in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that the simplest oscillation mode in an accretion flow, axisymmetric up-and-down motion at the meridional epicyclic frequency, may be directly observable when it occurs in the inner parts of accretion flow around black holes. Together with the second oscillation mode, an <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion</b> at the radial epicyclic frequency, it may then {{be responsible for the}} high-frequency modulations of the X-ray flux observed at two distinct frequencies (twin HF-QPOs) in micro-quasars.

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{high-resolution}} data of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission dayside phase to identify twenty-one previously unreported encounters with the electron diffusion region (EDR), as evidenced by electron agyrotropy, ion jet reversals, and j dot E greater than 0. Three of the new EDR encounters, which occurred within a one-minute-long interval on November 23 rd, 2016, are analyzed in detail. These events, which resulted from a relatively low and oscillating magnetopause velocity, contained large electric fields (several tens to hundreds of milliVolts per meter), crescent-shaped electron velocity phase space densities, large currents (greater than 2 microAmperes per square meter), and Ohmic heating of the plasma (near or exceeding 10 nanoWatts per cubic meter). Because of the slow <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion</b> of the magnetopause, two of these events show the unprecedented mixture of perpendicular and parallel crescents, indicating the first breaking and reconnecting of solar wind and magnetospheric field lines. An extended list of thirty-two EDR or near-EDR events is also included, and demonstrates {{a wide variety of}} observed plasma behavior inside and surrounding the reconnection site...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} two high bandwidth short-stroke rotary fast tool servos and the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator developed for one of them. Design insights, trade-off methodologies, and analytical tools are developed for precision mechanical systems, power and signal electronic systems, control systems, normal-stress electromagnetic actuators, and {{the dynamics of the}} combined systems. A fast tool servo (FTS) is a high-speed auxiliary servo axis that is added to a diamond turning machine (ultra-precision lathe) to allow generating free-form non-axisymmetric or textured surfaces on a workpiece. A rotary fast tool servo produces an <b>in-and-out</b> <b>motion</b> of the tool relative to a workpiece by swinging the tool along an arc having a fixed radius. The rotary fast tool servos developed in this project were designed for diamond turning prescription textured surfaces on small spherical workpieces (diameters in the range of 10 mm or less), and are suitable for generating free-form non-axisymmetric surfaces on similar-sized workpieces. Straightforward modifications would allow them to be used on larger workpieces. These rotary fast tool servos set new benchmarks for demonstrated closed-loop bandwidth (2 kHz and 10 kHz) and tool tip acceleration (400 g). (cont.) The first machine, referred to as the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo, uses a commercially available moving-magnet galvanometer as the actuator (Lorentz force), and provides proof-of-principles for a flexure bearing, small diamond tool and mounting method, circuit topology for a high bandwidth current-mode amplifier, and control system design. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 2 kHz, 20 g tool tip acceleration at 2 kHz, maximum tool travel of 50 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 10 nm PP. The 2 kHz FTS is integrated with a diamond turning machine and used to produce optical quality textured surfaces on the face and outside diameter of aluminum workpieces while operating at 2 kHz. The machining tests validate that a rotary-type fast tool servo can be used to produce optical quality surfaces on a spherical workpiece from its pole to its equator. The second machine, referred to as the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, incorporates the proof-of-principles from the first machine and is the vehicle for developing the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator used in it. (cont.) The actuator is a normal-stress variable reluctance machine with a demonstrated order of magnitude increase in the peak torque and in the ratio of peak torque divided by the electrical power at its terminals, when compared to the actuator used in the 2 kHz FTS. By integrating the tool holder directly to the moving mass of the actuator to form a single rigid body, the overall torque-to-inertia ratio for the system and the frequency of the first uncoupled-mass resonance are both increased. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 10 kHz, 400 g tool tip acceleration at 5 kHz, 870 g tool tip acceleration at 10 kHz (aided by a stable mechanical resonance), maximum tool travel of 70 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 1. 4 to 2. 5 nm rms (depending on the magnitude of the bias flux used). The hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator utilizes a constant bias magnetic flux, which linearizes the torque versus drive-current relationship for the actuator and provides up to half of the torque-producing magnetic flux in the rotor/stator air gaps. The actuator is similar to the rotary actuators used to drive and sustain a resonance in a mechanical oscillator in certain electric engraving heads. (cont.) This research is distinguished from the prior art by the ability to generate closed-loop arbitrary trajectories for the tool tip. Using a separate current-mode amplifier for each stator half allows demonstrating closed-loop control of the rotary and linear degrees of freedom that are inherent in this class of actuators. This research is further distinguished from the prior art by a magnetic circuit that substantially decouples certain magnetic flux paths when a coil is used instead of a permanent magnet to provide the bias magnetic flux. This reduces the complexity of the actuator electrical dynamics from a MIMO system to a SISO system, and allows using loop-shaping techniques with classical control theory to design the control systems. Torque control for the hybrid rotary/linear actuator in the 10 kHz FTS is independent of force control, but force control requires a torque-generating current to act as an operating point. Alternate magnetic circuit topologies that fully decouple torque and force control are described and compared. Future work that utilizes the linear mode as an active suspension for improving the performance of a predominantly rotary system is considered. Using the experience gained by designing, building, and testing the 10 kHz FTS and hybrid rotary/linear actuator, future work involving alternate concepts for the actuator is suggested for a follow-on rotary fast tool servo, and a high bandwidth steering mirror. by Richard Clement Montesanti.
