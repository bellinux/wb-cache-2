40|$|This study aims to {{test the}} effect of {{cooperative}} learning methods, the jigsaw method to interpersonal relationship skill and teamwork of undergraduate students Faculty of Psychology in University A. This study used experimental method with one group and pre posttest design. There are 63 undergraduate students in Educational Psychology Class of 2008 / 2009 as the subjects. The measurement instrument was Interpersonal Relationship Skill Scale and Teamwork Scale. Interpersonal relationship and teamwork score compared {{before and after the}} learning methods were given and tested using paired samples t test. The result shows that comparing the pretest and posttest score of interpersonal relationship variable, we <b>got</b> <b>t</b> ‐ 1, 748 with p = 0, 043 (p < 0, 05). This is indicated that jigsaw learning method has significant effect to improving the interpersonal relationship skill in undergraduate students.

40|$|Most logic-based AI {{research}} {{works at}} a meta-theoretical level, producing new logics and studying their properties. Little effort is made to show how these logics {{can be used to}} formalise object-level theories of common sense. In the spirit of Pat Hayes's Naive Physics Manifesto, the present paper supplies a formalisation of a non-trivial benchmark problem in common sense physical reasoning, namely how to crack an egg. The formalisation is based on the event calculus. Introduction Pat Hayes's "Naive Physics Manifesto" papers are wellknown and widely cited [Hayes, 1979], [Hayes, 1985 a], yet few researchers in AI have taken seriously the research programme he proposed. 1 Logic-based research in AI remains dominated by meta-theory. Papers typically present new logics, extend old ones, or study their meta-level properties. Examples that show how the logic in question is used are usually trivial and are frequently absent altogether. It seems to be taken for granted that, once we've <b>got</b> <b>t</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The resting ionic conductances of frog sartorius {{muscle fibers}} have been {{determined}} {{in a variety}} of conditions in order to measure the potassium conductance of the tubular and surface membranes (g~:t and gK') and the chloride conductance of the tubular and surface membranes (<b>got</b> <b>t</b> and gore). In both normal fibers and fibers without tubules, measurements of input resistance and diameter were made at normal pH and at low pH when the chloride conductance was very small. These measurements permitted the separation of the ionic conductances: gct ' = 219 #mhos/cm~; golt- " 0 #mhos/cm~; gK " = 28 /~mhos/cm 2; gK t = 55 #rnhos/cm ~. Possible sources of systematic error are discussed and a statistical analysis of the effects of random error is presented. The implications of the nonuniformity of membrane properties are discussed along with possible anatomical explanations. The membrane which encloses the sarcoplasm of frog sartorius fibers consists of the circumferential surface membrane and tubular invaginations of the membrane (located at the Z line in each sarcomere) which constitut...|$|E
