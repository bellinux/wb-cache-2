500|$|Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first {{adaptation}} {{outside of}} comic books {{took place in}} the third season of Batman (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second season episodes, [...] "Batman's Waterloo" [...] and [...] "The Duo Defy". Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I used to think the reason they <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> because I had a cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, he {{continued}} {{talking about the}} hosting gig at an interview for Playboy. There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you <b>hired</b> <b>me,</b> because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this stuff's going to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry. Before Twitter, I always had that buffer period when I could actually think and decide, Is this worth it? ... For me Twitter is a dangerous thing".|$|E

[...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women. Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in [...] (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997) and Beware the Batman (2013), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in [...] (2008) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode [...] "Artifacts" [...] (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.|$|E

5000|$|Years later {{during an}} interview, he {{described}} an {{early part of}} the discussion he had with Goldsholl (1911-1995): [...] "Morton Goldsholl told me, unlike the other people, that he wanted a designer. And he said that he wasn't <b>hiring</b> <b>me</b> because I was black and he felt sorry for me. He said he was <b>hiring</b> <b>me</b> because he needed a designer. That turned a corner for me." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it bothered me a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it when I was your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [...] <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E

2500|$|Coulter {{contracted}} with USA Today {{to cover the}} 2004 Democratic National Convention. She wrote one article that began, [...] "Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston..." [...] and referred to some unspecified female attendees as [...] "corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over [...] "basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable". An explanatory article by the paper {{went on to say}} [...] "Coulter told the online edition of Editor & Publisher magazine that USA Today doesn't like my [...] "tone", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> to write for them.'" [...] USA Today replaced Coulter with Jonah Goldberg, and Coulter published it instead on her website.|$|E

[...] It was a loft, a factory {{going out of business}} that had a lot of sewing machines in it. [...] Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program. [...] That was the beginning. [...] I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program." [...] Kinshasa Conwill, former director of the museum, says that the program [...] "has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lambert's {{association}} with Thames and Euston Films {{continued into the}} 1980s. In 1982, she rejoined the staff of parent company Thames Television as Director of Drama, and was given {{a seat on the}} company's board. In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as Chief Executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as Director of Production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her job here was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. [...] "Unfortunately, the person who <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of — Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese — it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who <b>hired</b> <b>me,</b> was a man of exceptional intelligence and class who knew how to get along with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned good at what he did. [...] I think more than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E
