5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes piano {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} in jazz {{in the late}} 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the instrument in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification allowed him to be heard much more easily in groups {{when compared to the}} piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the next few years, including playing it through a wah wah. Another former Davis sideman, Chick Corea started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s, as did Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. From 1969's <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way and Bitches Brew onwards, the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s. Vince Guaraldi started using a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both a piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for A Charlie Brown Christmas and other Peanuts / Charlie Brown films.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20â€“16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E

25|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} was met by {{controversy}} among music critics, particularly those of jazz and rock music, who were divided in their reaction to its experimental musical structure and Davis's electronic approach. Since its initial reception, it has been regarded by fans and critics as one of Davis's greatest and most influential works. In 2001, Columbia Legacy and Sony Music released the three-disc box set The Complete <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way Sessions, which includes the original album, additional tracks, and the unedited recordings used to produce <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way is {{a studio}} album by American jazz {{musician}} Miles Davis, released July 30, 1969 on Columbia Records. Produced by Teo Macero, {{the album was}} recorded in one session date on February 18, 1969 at CBS 30th Street Studio in New York City. Incorporating elements of classical sonata form, Macero edited and arranged Davis's recordings from the session to produce the album. Marking {{the beginning of his}} , <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way has been regarded by music writers as Davis's first fusion recording, following a stylistic shift toward the genre in his previous records and live performances.|$|E

25|$|The album {{featured}} virtuoso guitarist and newcomer John McLaughlin, who had {{one month}} {{prior to the}} February 18 <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way session recorded his classic debut album Extrapolation.

Williams brought McLaughlin to Davis' house the night before the scheduled session for <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Way. Davis had not heard the guitarist before, but was so impressed that he told him to show up at the studio the next day. McLaughlin would go on to great fame in the 1970s as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.|$|E

Corea experimented with using electric instruments, mainly the Fender Rhodes electric piano, in the Davis band.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the pretext}} {{that he had}} {{returned}} late from a honeymoon in Brazil, Hancock was dismissed from Davis's band. In the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet.
