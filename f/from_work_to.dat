5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the Minor Counties {{played a}} minimum of eight matches, until recent times of two days duration, and few of them played more than 12 matches.

When they competed, the first-class county second elevens often played many more games.|$|E
25|$|Sir James Paget had {{the gift}} of eloquence, {{and was one of}} the most careful and most {{delightful}} speakers of his time. He had a natural and unaffected pleasure in society, and he loved music. He possessed the rare gift of the ability to turn swiftly <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> play, enjoying his holidays like a schoolboy, easily moved to laughter, keen to get the maximum of happiness out of very ordinary amusements, emotional in spite of incessant self-restraint, and vigorous in spite of constant overwork. In him a certain light-hearted enjoyment was combined with the utmost reserve, unfailing religious faith, and the most scrupulous honour. He was all his life profoundly indifferent toward politics, both national and medical; his ideal was the unity of science and practice in the professional life.|$|E
25|$|By 1985 {{the number}} of {{institutions}} of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.|$|E

500|$|Boeing {{has worked}} with General Electric to offer a 2% {{improvement}} in fuel efficiency to new aircraft beginning in 2016.

Charla's foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall. Charla had been planning to celebrate her 12th birthday at an amusement park on the next day. Prosecutors believe that John entered the house with intent on sexually molesting the girl. When she caught him in the house, Prosecutors believe, he chased her into the bedroom, and placed her underwear in her mouth. He raped her, placed a nightgown over her head, and strangled her to death.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{began to}} work with Toronto-based indie {{developer}} Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game that showed 2D views of a 3D space. Fish provided the project's art until the partnership crumbled due to creative differences: Fish wanted their product {{to be more of}} a platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time, and incorporated the idea of voxels (3D pixels), where a 2D pixel could be seen from four sides. The game would become Fez and the game's design, lore, and art derived from this game mechanic. Fish searched for a programmer on DeviantArt and Renaud Bédard, the first person to apply, became the game's programmer. Fez was first announced in July 2007 and was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival. Fish's employer, Artificial Mind and Movement, would not let him take leave <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> attend, so Fish quit. He marked this January 2008 moment as [...] "when I became indie". The game received widespread attention upon its showing at the festival, leading Fish to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company with a government loan.|$|E

2500|$|Although Detroit had a Rapid Transit Commission, it was {{not popular}} with the {{politicians}} or the public after the strikes of 1946 ended and automobile production resumed.

[...] During the war, three expressways were built to support the region's war industries. [...] Furthermore, the wartime model of federal, state, and local governments jointly planning and funding expressways gave a successful model for planning and financing more highways. Progress was slow in 1945-47 because of inflation, steel shortages, {{and the difficulty of}} building in built-up areas. by the early 1950s highways were in place, and plans were underway to make Detroit a central hub in the forthcoming Interstate Highway System. [...] The new highways had a funding advantage over mass transit because of the availability of federal highway monies coupled with the availability of matching state money. [...] Ultimately, they were paid for by gasoline taxes, which commuters seldom grumbled about.|$|E

Athalie Range would later say, [...] "His campaign decided to play the race card, which took me out of contention." [...] Many black voters had been allowed to take time off <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> vote in the primary, but were not allowed to do so for the runoff.
