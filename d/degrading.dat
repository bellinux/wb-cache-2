Four solid hydrocarbons including biphenyl, camphor, phenanthrene and naphthalene and four liquid hydrocarbons i. e. benzene, toluene, octane and heptane were used in this study. In the case of solid hydrocarbons a total of 17 % <b>degraded</b> biphenyl, 8 % <b>degraded</b> camphor, 8 % <b>degraded</b> naphthalene and 10 % <b>degraded</b> phenanthrene.

Yet vertebrate frugivores are declining around the world, and {{little is known}} about the impact of this loss on regeneration of <b>degraded</b> areas. Here, we use a unique natural experiment to assess how complete vertebrate frugivore loss affects native seed rain in <b>degraded</b> forest. All native vertebrate frugivores (which were primarily avian frugivores) have been functionally extirpated from the island of Guam by the invasive brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), whereas the nearby island of Saipan has a relatively intact vertebrate frugivore community. We captured seed rain along transects extending from intact into <b>degraded</b> forest and compared the species richness, density and condition of the seed rain from native bird-dispersed tree species between the two islands. Considering seeds from native bird-dispersed species, approximately 1. 66 seeds landed per 26 days in each square meter of <b>degraded</b> forest on Saipan, whereas zero seeds landed per 26 days per square meter in <b>degraded</b> forest on Guam. Additionally, on Saipan, 69 % of native bird-dispersed seeds in intact forest and 77 % of seeds in <b>degraded</b> forest lacked fleshy fruit pulp, suggesting ingestion by birds, compared to 0 % of all seeds on Guam.

5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
