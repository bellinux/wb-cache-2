For example, hip hop musicians learn 'the culture of hip hop' {{when they begin}} their career. We are not like those musicians and we love the music as sounds very much. Those professional people may say 'What are you doing?' but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> musical style is cool after all. The good thing is good." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the study were {{politically}} sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications {{on the eve of a}} contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war and I still think that the war was a bad idea, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> science has transcended our perspectives." ...|$|E

In the meanwhile, I expect the opposition will let us feel their hand; there may be developments during the winter.” He turned to Jaques. “We’ll lay the sloop up out of sight with the next big tides and then go south and look for work.

5000|$|Vampire Weekend {{also used}} The Beatles as an {{influence}} saying to Columbia University's alumni journalist [...] "they played extremely popular music {{but at the}} same time drew upon Eastern and Western sources. Whereas today, rock music has killed itself by being so white bread. We're trying to mix sounds that are old and new and sounds that are Western and that are not Western. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>our</b> vibe."

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, the band explained {{that the nature of}} being a musical theatre act means they don't consider their new album a collection of cover versions. Jamie Lambert said, [...] "I mean, people say it's covers, but they're not really, If you cover someone else's song, a pop song, that's a cover; we're not covering musical theatre songs, we're actually performing them - that's the difference.

You know, with musical theatre you take on a character so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> <b>our</b> argument with it.

Elaborating on the track, Lacey described it as being more catchy and easier to sing along to than the band's more recent releases, with a less complicated melodic structure; [...] "If you look at Daisy, you'll see that the melodies were a little more complicated - I don't want to write or listen to music that tires me out after hearing it and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>our</b> goal with the new music", although Lacey believed [...] "Mene" [...] doesn't entirely represent the musical direction the band are going in with their newer material and fifth album.|$|R
