25|$|Much of {{the cause}} of all this may {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and now that they were once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be <b>expected.</b> <b>Hence</b> the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E

6000|$|The {{congregation}} was, {{in those}} days, of a really rural character. City fashions were as yet unknown, or unregarded, {{by the country}} people of the neighborhood. Steam-boats had not as yet confounded town with country. A weekly market-boat from Tarry town, the [...] "Farmers' Daughter," [...] navigated by the worthy Gabriel Requa, was the only communication between all these parts and the metropolis. A rustic belle in those days considered {{a visit to the}} city in much the same light as one of our modern fashionable ladies regards a visit to Europe; an event that may possibly take place once {{in the course of a}} lifetime, but to be hoped for, rather than <b>expected.</b> <b>Hence</b> the array of the congregation was chiefly after the primitive fashions existing in Sleepy Hollow; or if, by chance, there was a departure from the Dutch sun-bonnet, or the apparition of a bright gown of flowered calico, it caused quite a sensation throughout the church.

Now {{the parent}} or parents, since {{they live and}} breed, must be more or less, but sufficiently, adapted to their {{conditions}} of living-- more or less fitted {{to the needs of}} life. The variation in the young animal will be one of three kinds: it will fit the animal still better to the conditions under which its kind live, or it will be a change for the worse, or it is possible to imagine that the variation-- as in the colour variations of domesticated cats-- will affect its prospects in life very little. In the first case, the probability is that the new animal will get on in life, and breed, and multiply above the average; in the second, it is probable that, in the competition for food and other amenities of life, the disadvantage, whatever it is, under which the animal suffers will shorten its career, and abbreviate the tale of its offspring; while, in the third case, an average career may be <b>expected.</b> <b>Hence,</b> disregarding accidents, which may be eliminated from the problem by taking many cases, there is a continual tendency among the members of a species of animals in favour of the proportionate increase of the individuals most completely adapted to the conditions under which the species lives. That is, while the conditions remain unchanged, the animals, considered as one group, are continually more highly perfected to live under those conditions.

30|$|Before {{differentiating}} {{between the}} various types of mobile crowdsensing activities, it is important to first provide clarity to avoid ambiguity {{in the use of the}} terms crowdsensing and crowdsourcing. In crowdsourcing, a top-down approach is adopted and the aim is to source the solution to a complex problem by splitting it into smaller tasks that can be executed by individual members of the public [10, 21]. Often times, the crowdsourcer has an idea of what to expect and the geographical location of participants is not a barrier. Whereas in crowdsensing, a bottom-up approach is adopted and the aim is to understand or sense a complex problem of interest by splitting the responsibility of harvesting relevant information to the crowd and then aggregating the results to obtain an emergent outlook of the phenomenon [10, 21]. In the case of crowdsensing, geographical location of participants is critical and there is often no knowledge about what to <b>expect,</b> <b>hence</b> the need for sensing to obtain an output that approximates the opinion of the whole crowd [10].|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the {{proficiency}} of domain {{knowledge has}} {{a direct impact on}} the fault detection and removal efficiency [14]. If the submitted fix cannot completely remove the fault, the number of actual remaining errors in the software is higher than what we estimated. These remaining faults contained in the software, indeed, affect the quality of the product. The company will release the software based on the scheduled date and pre-determined software reliability value; however, the actual quality of the software product is not as good as what we <b>expect.</b> <b>Hence,</b> the amount of complaints from the end-user may be above expectations, and the penalty cost to fix the faults through an operation phase will be much higher than in an in-house environment [23]. In consequence, the software organization has to release the updated version of the software product earlier than determined, if they want to lower the fixing cost of software faults existing in the current release. Therefore, it is plausible to incorporate imperfect fault removal into software reliability modeling for consideration in the long run.|$|R

Merril Mattes attributes the lack of depth perception to altitude; this misled many sightseers to think it was much closer than it was. John Lewis was one of these disillusioned tourists that in many ways can be universally compared to the average pioneer on the trail. He wanted to see the butte that was a once in a lifetime view of this entity, but the distance to see it and the extra work this entailed was more than he was <b>expecting.</b> <b>Hence</b> while Courthouse Rock was massive and breathtaking, Lewis' overall experience of going so far out of his way was unexpected and disenchanting.|$|R

50|$|White adipose tissue, {{also known}} as white fat, {{is one of the}} 2 types of adipose tissue in mammals. White adipose tissue stores energy in form of fatty acids that are broken down from triglycerides. Its normal {{function}} is to store free fatty acids within the tissue. However, when the glucose level of in the cell drops in situations like fasting, white adipose tissue generates glycerol 3-phosphate. The presence of glyceroneogenesis in white adipose tissues is proven by an experiment with mouse. Since glycerol 3-phosphate is usually generated from glucose through glycolysis, level of triglyceride content was compared with normal mouse and mouse which cannot intake glucose in to their cells. Glucose transporter 4, {{also known as}} GLUT 4 (Figure 6) is the transporter protein of glucose which intakes extracellular glucose to intracellular environment. In order to examine the presence of glyceroneogenesis in mouse, genes expressing GLUT4 were deleted and triglyceride content of adipose tissue was compared with normal mouse. Since glucose cannot enter the cell, synthesis of glycerol 3-phosphate was expected to decrease. However, the result showed no change in triglyceride concentration. This experiment proved the presence of an alternate metabolic pathway to synthesize triglyceride in adipose tissues of mouse. Furthermore, an additional experiment was performed in order to examine the relation of the alternate glycerol 3-phosphate synthesizing pathway and PEPC-K. Triglyceride content in white adipose tissue of mouse with mutated gene which expresses PEPC-K was observed. Sine PEPC-K is the essential regulatory enzyme for glyceroneogenesis, mutation in PEPC-K genes would lower the activity of glyceroneogenesis. The result showed no production of triglyceride in white adipose tissues as <b>expected.</b> <b>Hence,</b> glyceroneogenesis was present in white adipose tissues because it was able to generate triglycerides without glucose and it was unable to synthesize when PEPC-K was mutated. Therefore, during fasting or low carbohydrate diet, white adipose tissues generate glycerol 3-phosphate using glyceroneogenesis.|$|E
