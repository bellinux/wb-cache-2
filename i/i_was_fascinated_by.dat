500|$|Love in the Time of Cholera {{is based}} on the stories of two couples. The young love of Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza {{is based on}} the love affair of García Márquez's parents. However, as García Márquez {{explains}} in an interview: “The only difference is [...] married. And {{as soon as they were}} married, they were no longer interesting as literary figures." [...] The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans, who were almost 80 years old, who met every year in Acapulco. They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the boatman with his oars. García Márquez notes, [...] "Through their death, the story of their secret romance became known. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> them. They were each married to other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't {{the scientific study of}} these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to disagree on nearly everything {{when it comes to}} human agency. Nonetheless, certain things are written in stone. One thinks. One acts. One makes mistakes. My focus in this dissertation is on these three simple facts and the relation between them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the different roles that knowledge plays with each: that is, the kind of knowledge one has of thoughts, actions, and mistakes.

Powerfully muscled though some of them were, there had been {{something}} wrong with all of them, an insufficient development here, an undue development there, a twist or a crook that destroyed symmetry, legs too short or too long, or too much sinew or bone exposed, or too little. Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, that far had they been what I should call feminine.|$|E

In spite of her frankly expressed preference for me she had an elusiveness that made a continual appeal to my imagination. She was never obvious or commonplace, and long before I began to experience the discomforts and sufferings of youthful love <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> a nature eloquent with contradictions and inconsistencies. She was a tomboy, yet her own sex was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by contact with the other: {{and no matter how}} many trees she climbed she never seemed to lose her daintiness.

40|$|As an essayist {{writing on}} Iconica; trans’forms, I {{feel a bit}} like Julian Huxley confronting the perplexing {{indeterminacy}} of ALife, with its curiously anachronistic gesture to our own 21 st century conception of Artificial Life.

60|$|I can {{scarcely}} tell now, on looking {{back with the}} great gap of five-and-thirty years between, what impression this singular man had made upon me. I distrusted him, I think, and yet <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> him also; for {{there was something in}} his bearing, in his look, and his whole fashion of speech which was entirely unlike anything that I had ever seen. Jim Horscroft was a fine man, and Major Elliott was a brave one, but they both lacked something that this wanderer had. It was the quick alert look, the flash of the eye, the nameless distinction which is so hard to fix. And then we had saved him when he lay gasping upon the shingle, and one's heart always softens towards what one has once helped.|$|E

The tomahawk seemed to take a horribly long time to come down. I saw it land, and the man's legs give under him as he crumpled. The niggers held him up by sheer strength while he was hacked a couple of times more. Then I got two more hacks on the head and decided that I was dead. So did the brute that was hacking me. I was too helpless to move, and I lay there and watched them removing the sentry's head. I must say they did it slick enough. They were old hands at the business.|$|E

They disappeared beyond that spinney (you may remember) where sixteen different kinds of bamboo grow together, all distinguishable to the learned eye. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the exquisite grace and beauty of that fluted grove, crowned with pointed leaves and feathery heads, the lightness, the vigour, the charm as distinct as a voice of that unperplexed luxuriating life. I remember staying to look at it for a long time, as one would linger within reach of a consoling whisper. The sky was pearly grey. It was one of those overcast days so rare in the tropics, in which memories crowd upon one, memories of other shores, of other faces.|$|E

And I put it to him with most naïve indiscretion which did not shock him visibly. He told me that the ship being only stranded, not sunk, the contraband cargo aboard was doubtless in good condition. The French custom-house men were guarding the wreck. If their vigilance could be—h’m—removed by some means, or even merely reduced, a lot of these rifles and cartridges could be taken off quietly at night by certain Spanish fishing boats.
