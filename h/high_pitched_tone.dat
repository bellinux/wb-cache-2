40|$|Consistent {{evidence}} suggests that pitch height may be represented in a spatial format, having both a vertical and an horizontal representation. The spatial representation of pitch height results into response compatibility effects for which <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> are preferentially associated to up-right responses, and low <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> are preferentially associated to down-left responses (i. e., the SMARC effect), with the strength of these associations depending on individuals’ musical skills. In this study we investigated whether listening to <b>tones</b> of different <b>pitch</b> affects the representation of external space, as assessed in a visual and haptic line bisection paradigm, in musicians and non musicians. Low and <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> affected the bisection performance in musicians differently, both when pitch was relevant and irrelevant for the task, and in both the visual and the haptic modality. No effect of pitch height was observed on the bisection performance of non musicians. Moreover, our data also show that musicians present a (supramodal) rightward bisection bias in both the visual and the haptic modality, extending previous findings limited to the visual modality, and {{consistent with the idea}} that intense practice with musical notation and bimanual instrument training affects hemispheric lateralization. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|Dholki {{is similar}} to the Dholak as the heads are a bit more developed. The Bass head is {{designed}} more like a tabla head with multi layered skins the paste is still {{on the inside of the}} bass head on the treble head side, there is visible paste applied on the outside of the head similar to the table giving this drum for nice <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tone</b> reminiscent to a high pitched tabla drum although not as resonant. The combination of the bass and treble tones is very pleasing. The heads are kept in place by metal hooks that have nuts at the bottom that can be tightened or loosened to adjust the pitch of the head. This makes changing the heads very quick. It is required to take caution while tuning as it is very easy to tighten the nuts too much resulting in head breakage. The Dholki's higher-pitched head is a simple membrane while the bass head, played usually with the left hand, has a compound syahi to lower the pitch and enable the typical Dholki sliding sound ("giss" [...] or [...] "gissa"), often the caked residue of mustard oil pressing, to which some sand and oil or tar may be added.|$|E

40|$|Although {{aging is}} {{accompanied}} by neurobiological changes and increased susceptibility to many neurological disorders, {{little is known about}} neurophysiological changes that start in old age. Here, neurophysiological changes during old age were assessed by recording brain potentials associated with motor preparation and stimulus expectancy (contingent negative variation, CNV) in young-old (60 - 69), oldest-old (85 - 98), and young (17 - 23) subjects. Individual trials began by a button press, followed 2. 5 s later by either a low or <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tone.</b> In the "motor" condition subjects responded following <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> (P = 0. 20); in the "non-motor" condition subjects did not respond. Motor condition CNV amplitudes in the oldest old were more positive than the young and young-old groups, which were similar. In the non-motor condition, the young-old and oldest-old had similar CNV amplitudes that were positive in polarity, and were significantly different from young subjects. Motor potentials before button presses that started the trials were comparable among groups. Results show that neural activity associated with motor preparation and stimulus expectancy changes during advanced age, and that group differences can be modulated by task requirements. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The octave or Deutsch {{illusion}} {{occurs when}} two tones, separated by about one octave, are presented simultaneously but alternating between ears, such {{that when the}} low tone is presented to the left ear the high tone is presented to the right ear and vice versa. Most subjects hear a single tone that alternates both between ears and in pitch; i. e., they hear a low pitched tone in one ear alternating with a <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tone</b> in the other ear. The present study examined whether the illusion can be elicited by aperiodic signals consisting of low-frequency band-pass filtered noises with overlapping spectra. The amount of spectral overlap was held constant, but the high- and low-frequency content of the signals was systematically varied. The majority of subjects perceived an auditory illusion {{in terms of a}} dominant ear for pitch and lateralization by frequency, as proposed by Deutsch [(1975 a) Sci. Am. 233, 92 - 104]. Furthermore, the salience of the illusion increased as the high frequency of the content in the signal increased. Since no harmonics were present in the stimuli, {{it is highly unlikely that}} this illusion is perceived on the basis of binaural diplacusis or harmonic binaural fusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{labor force}} of the younger men in Japan has been {{centered}} in urban regions for these several years. Consequently in the rural regions, {{the role of the}} older people there is becoming important more and more, and their labor force should be re-evaluated in the present time. Thus, these investigations were made on some physiological functions of the forty years and older aged people in an agricultural distirct. Standing height, body weight, chest circumference, sitting vertex height, back muscular power and vital capacity of aging people have a tendency to decrease with age and those in male have larger values than those in female. Especially in back muscular power the declining rate of men is more remarkable than that of women. In arm circumference there is no great difference between right and left, between sexes and among the four age groups. Comparing the present data in the rural population to the Japanese average value, the former was neither taller nor heavier, smaller in muscularity, skeletal development or fatness. Hand grip pressure decreases with age in both men and women and has difference between right and left, and sexes. This tendency is in accordance with the report of SCHWARZ 11) et al. The mean systolic blood pressure rises with age until 79 years but mean diastolic blood pressures do scarcely vary or slightly decrease. This fact is similar to the report of LASSER 18) and MASTER with 80, 000 normal subjects. F. E. V. 1. 0 % has no difference between sexes, and, in male, it decreases with age. All the values are in the range 70 - 80 %. NAKAMURA 21) TAKIJIMA state in their report that F. E. V. 1. 0 % shows decreasing tendency with age and the normal value is over 70 %.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{a special}} tone sandhi of rising tone(shangsheng) in Tongcheng dialect(a type of JianghuaiMandarin dialect). In this dialect, when a rising tone {{occurs in the}} non-final {{syllable}} position in a prosodic word, it often becomes a very short tone along with a high fundamental frequency (F 0). The sandhi tone of this type is dramatically different from the corresponding citation tone, which either stands alone or occurs in the final syllable position in a prosodic word. In Tongcheng dialect, this kind of tone sandhi is actually not limited to rising tone. However, it is rising tone that is the easiest one to undergo such a sandhi process [...] almost without exception. Based on a detailed investigation into the cases of rising tone sandhi in Tongcheng dialect, this thesis describes the multiple conditions by which this tone sandhi occurs. In addition, {{with the help of}} experimental phonetics and generative phonology, this thesis advances a theoretical account for the mechanisms which underlie this sandhi process, finding out the phonological and grammatical factors that are jointly responsible for triggering the occurrence of this tone sandhi.

50|$|Typically, a lineman {{tests the}} {{terminal}} equipment (telephone set) ringer by calling a ringback telephone number or a vertical service code, and then hanging up {{and waiting for}} the telephone to ring. When answering, the switch may play a low frequency signal tone, at which point the technician flashes the line (hangs up briefly) one or more times. A <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tone</b> then indicates ringback is engaged, and the technician hangs up. The phone will then ring, answering only with a verification tone when picked up. The verification tone is added so that telephone subscribers cannot easily use the ringback system as an intercom, to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a ringback test {{and waiting for the}} phone to stop ringing and converse when someone else on their own line has answered the extension.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{is better}} when a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tone</b> is {{associated}} with an up or right response and a low <b>pitch</b> <b>tone</b> with a down or left response compared to the opposite pairs, which is called the spatial-musical association of response codes (SMARC) effect. The current study examined whether polarity codes are formed {{in terms of the}} variation in loudness. In Experiments 1 and 2, in which participants performed a loudness-judgment task and a timbre-judgment task respectively, the correspondence effect was obtained between loudness and response side regardless of whether loudness was relevant to the task or not. In Experiments 3 and 4, in which the identical loudness- and timbre-judgment tasks were conducted while the auditory stimulus was presented only to the left or right ear, the correspondence effect was modulated by the ear to which the stimulus was presented, even though the effect was marginally significant in Experiment 4. The results suggest that loudness produced polarity codes that influenced response selection (Experiments 1 & 2), and additional spatial codes provided by stimulus position modulated the effect, generating the stimulus eccentricity effect (Experiments 3 & 4), which is consistent with the polarity correspondence principle...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{researchers}} at the UCLA tested the hypothesis that distraction can change the way a task is learned.

In the single task (ST) case, subjects only learned to predict the weather. In the dual task (DT) case, subjects were also asked to count the number of <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tones.</b> The ability to use the learned knowledge was found to be about the same in either case. However, subjects were significantly better at identifying cue-associations (a test of declarative knowledge) when trained under ST rather than DT conditions.

The authors concluded that while distraction may not decrease the level of learning, it can result in a reduced ability to flexibly use that knowledge ...|$|R

Subjects were 128 talented singers, ages 8 - 11, equally divided among boys and girls, who sang 16 pitch-matching patterns; 4 patterns were melodic and 12 were harmonic. In 4 harmonic patterns, the upper tone was matched; in another 4, the lower tone was matched, and in the last set, the middle tone was matched. Two judges recorded correct/incorrect responses across 1, 536 trials with 85 % agreements. Results of a three-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated no differ-ences between age or sex groups and significant differences among pitch-matching tasks.

5000|$|Beginning in the 1980s many North American Class I railroads began adding radio {{transmitters}} {{and mechanical}} voices to their defect detectors; as trains passed detectors, the mechanical or pre-recorded voice would sound {{out on the}} railroad's main road radio channel that a train has passed and note any defects that were found. Most often, after a train has passed such an equipped detector, the mechanical voice will report the railroad name, milepost or location, track number (if applicable), number of axles on the train that passed and the phrase [...] "no defects" [...] to indicate that no problems were detected on the train. Sometimes the location's ambient temperature and train speed are also noted by the mechanical voice.

Here, we present findings on the vocalizations and associated behaviors of two species: Sombre Hummingbird (Aphantochroa cirrhochloris) and Rufous-breasted Hermit (Glaucis hirsutus). These are the only hummingbirds in which the brain areas activated by singing have been demonstrated. They are also among the basal species of their respective subfamilies, Trochilinae and Phaethornithinae and, thus, represent early stages {{in the evolution of}} hummingbird vocal communication. We found that the two species exhibit distinctive vocalizations and behaviors. Sombre Hummingbird calls had more modulation and were often used during agonistic interactions, whereas Rufous-breasted Hermit calls had <b>higher</b> <b>pitch</b> and purer <b>tones</b> and were produced in less aggressive interactions. Sombre Hummingbird song was highly stereotyped in syllable structure and syntax, whereas Rufous-breasted Hermit song was highly variable. Comparative analysis points to consistent similarities in use of vocalizations by the Sombre Hummingbird and other trochilines, and by the Rufous-breasted Hermit and other phaethornithines. We hypothesize that differences in vocal behavior between hummingbird lineages arise as adaptations to their foraging strategies...|$|R
