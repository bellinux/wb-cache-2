40|$|In {{this thesis}} we model and analyze {{a series of}} closed loop supply chains to study the {{relationships}} among remanufacturability and profitability of {{each member of the}} supply chain. We also study the relationships among remanufacturability, government subsidy, and government penalty. In each model, we assume that the closed loop supply chain consists of a manufacturer who manufactures as well as collects used products and remanufactures and a retailer who in turn sells the products to her consumers. Also, we assume that the level of remanufacturability is a variable that is controllable via the level of investment of remanufacturing technology and equipment. Furthermore, in the case of government subsidy and penalty, we assume that the government provides a level of subsidy per remanufactured product and finances the subsidy by collecting an advance recovery fee per unit sold from the retailer. Throughout this thesis, we also assume that the manufacturer behaves as the leader and the retailer as the follower under a Stackelberg game framework and the model environment is captured in a static framework regarding manufacturing and remanufacturing. Numerous managerial insights and economic implications are obtained. For example, the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s profit may actually decrease with respect to the collection rate if the collection rate is low in the case of no government intervention {{in the form of the}} subsidy and penalty. Also, the government may be able to increase the total surplus consisting of all the profits of the supply chains and the consumer surplus by determining the appropriate level of the <b>fee</b> <b>unit</b> remanufactured subsidy and the <b>fee</b> <b>unit</b> sold advance recovery fee...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{clock and}} control (CC) {{system for the}} EuXFEL {{megapixel}} detectors consists of a multi-purpose MTCA. 4 AMC card with a Xilinx FPGA and a custom designed Rear Transition Module (RTM) which provides the CC functionality. The system resides in a MTCA. 4 crate with the Timing Receiver (TR) board and synchronises the DAQ system to the general EuXFEL timing. This paper presents the experiences with the prototype system in addition to describing the RTM hardware and the CC system firmware in detail. The tests that have been performed to validate the basic MTCA. 4 specifications related functionality are presented first. The next stage of tests involve confirming the system functionality by using the TR board {{as it would be}} in the EuXFEL DAQ system and a development board to simulate a Front End Electronics (<b>FEE)</b> <b>unit.</b> The performance metrics in terms of jitter and bit error rates for FEE communication are presented. As a result of the performance tests, the improvements and modifications to the current hardware for the final system are outlined in the conclusions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} analyzing B 2 B transactions and supply chain management based on integrating contract procurement markets with spot markets using capacity options and forwards. The framework is motivated {{by the emergence of}} B 2 B exchanges in several industrial sectors to facilitate such integrated contract and spot procurement. In the framework developed, a Buyer and multiple Sellers may either contract for delivery in advance (the " option) or they may buy and sell some or all of their input/output in a spot market. Contract pricing involves both a reservation <b>fee</b> per <b>unit</b> of capacity and an execution <b>fee</b> per <b>unit</b> of output if capacity is called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for the Buyer and these Sellers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. Existence and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated competitive game between Sellers with heterogeneous technologies, under the assumption that they know the Buyer's demand function. This allows an explicit characterization of the price of capacity options and the value of managerial exibility, aswell as providing conditions under which B 2 B exchanges are e cient and sustainable...|$|R

Manufacturers compensate retailers for promotional shelf space with a per <b>unit</b> time slotting <b>fee</b> when inter-retailer competition on the particular product makes compensation with a lower wholesale price a more costly way to generate equilibrium retailer shelf space rents.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{franchising}} competition in locationally differentiated products is constructed. A franchisor (upstream firm) collects a marginal transfer <b>fee</b> per <b>unit</b> of output sold by a franchisee (downstream firm). For example, the marginal transfer fee {{can be realized}} as a markup on variable inputs supplied by the franchisor. A franchisor also collects a lump-sum rent (commonly called "franchising fee") from each franchisee. Acting in the first stage, a franchisor can manipulate the degree of competition in the downstream market through his choice of the marginal fee while keeping the franchisee’s profits at zero through the lump sum rent. Franchisees choose prices for the final goods in the second stage. It is shown that, at the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, the marginal fee is above marginal cost. Compared to a regime of vertically integrated firms, prices are higher, there are more numerous outlets when contractual costs are small, and social surplus is lower in the franchising regime. ...|$|R

The main concern {{of this paper is}} with pricing of goods that are likely to be consumed in large quantities by individuals. For example, will software continue to be sold at a fixed price for each unit, or will it be paid for on the basis of usage? There is substantial evidence both from observing marketplace evolution and from surveys that customers overwhelmingly prefer subscription pricing. It turns out that even if we ignore this factor, peruse pricing is not a clear winner, and therefore when the preference effect is taken into account, subscription pricing is likely to dominate.
