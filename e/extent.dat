40|$|Adding environments as {{first-class}} {{values to}} a language can greatly enhance its expressiveness. But first-class environments do not mesh well into a lexically scoped language since {{they rely on}} identifiers (variable names). By distinguishing variables from identifiers and therefore <b>extents</b> from environments, we present an alternative: first-class <b>extents.</b> First-class <b>extents</b> are defined on variables rather than identifiers and are therefore immune to name capturing problems that plague first-class environments. Then by distinguishing variables from locations and therefore <b>extents</b> from stores, our first-class <b>extents</b> can coexist with imperative features and still allow tail-recursion to be properly implemented as iteration. To test our claims, we extend Scheme {{with a collection of}} features that are essential to first-class <b>extents,</b> give a denotational semantics for the extension, and demonstrate that it can be fully embedded into Scheme albeit losing tail-recursiveness. Then we show how [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concepts}} of everywhere and somewhere generate three spatial extents: (1) everywhere, (2) somewhere but not everywhere, and (3) nowhere. These three <b>extents</b> {{can be used}} for the granular description of spatial regions. When spatio-temporal regions are considered there are two additional concepts: always and sometimes. The interaction of the four concepts can be used to produce various systems of spatio-temporal <b>extents.</b> The paper shows that if we want to give granular descriptions of spatio-temporal regions, then the system of <b>extents</b> needs to be chosen carefully. A suitable system of eleven spatio-temporal <b>extents</b> is identi- ed, and a simplied system of six <b>extents</b> is also described. The systems of <b>extents</b> presented here are important in that they will allow various structures and theories understood only in a purely spatial context to be generalized to the spatio-temporal case.

For reaction systems, the state variables (the numbers of moles, or concentrations) have recently been transformed into decoupled reaction variants (<b>extents</b> of reaction), and reaction invariants (<b>extents</b> of flow) (Amrhein et al., AIChE Journal, 2010). This paper analyses the conditions under which an open homogeneous reaction system is cooperative in the <b>extents</b> domain. Further, it is shown that {{the dynamics of}} the <b>extents</b> of flow exhibit cooperative behavior. Further, we provide the conditions under which {{the dynamics of the}} <b>extents</b> of reaction exhibit cooperative behavior. Our results provide physical insights into cooperative and competitive nature of the underlying reaction system in the presence of material exchange with surrounding (i. e., inlet and outlet flows).
