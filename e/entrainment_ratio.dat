40|$|New flow-visualization {{experiments}} on mixing layers of various velocity and density ratios are reported. It is shown that, in mixing layers developing from laminar initial conditions, the familiar mechanism of growth by vortex amalgamation is replaced at the mixing transition by a previously unrecognized mechanism {{in which the}} spanwise-coherent large structures individually undergo continuous linear growth. In the organized post-transition flow it is this continuous linear growth of the individual structures that produces the self-similar growth of the mixing-layer thickness, with the occasional interactions between neighbouring structures occurring {{as a consequence of}} their growth, not its cause. It is also observed that periods during which the post-transition mixing layer comprises orderly processions of large structures alternate with periods during which no large-scale organization is apparent downstream of the transition location. These two fully turbulent flow states are characterized by different growth rates, <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratios</b> and orientations of the mixing layer relative to the free streams.

However, basic CO 2 transcritical refrigeration cycle suffers from large expansion loss {{due to high}} pressure difference between gas cooler and evaporator. Then, {{it is crucial to}} find effective and economic way to reduce the expansion loss. Here, a novel cycle with two ejectors is proposed for the first time. Compared with conventional ejector-expansion CO 2 cycle with only one ejector, this novel cycle with two ejectors is able to recover more expansion loss, thus improving the system performance further. A computational model is designed to simulate the double ejector CO 2 cycle. Simulation results show its high system COP.

Measures of ejector efficiency {{have not always been}} clearly defined and the rationale underlying and justifying current performance metrics is often unclear. One common means of assessing performance is to define a thermodynamically reversible reference process against which real processes may be benchmarked. These reversible processes represent the thermodynamic limit of real ejector performance. In this paper, parameters from real and reversible processes are compared and performance metrics are defined. In particular, the <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> of real devices is compared to the reversible <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> and denoted the reversible <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> efficiency. An efficiency comparing the ejector performance to that of a turbine-compressor system is also investigated, as is an exergetic efficiency. A rigorous analysis of performance metrics reported in the literature is undertaken. Graphical illustrations are provided to support intuitive understanding of these metrics. Analytical equations are also formulated for ideal-gas models. The performance metrics are then applied to existing experimental data to illustrate the difference in their numerical values. The reversible <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> efficiency η[subscript RER] is shown to always be lower than the turbine-compressor efficiency η[subscript TER].

Purpose Long-term stresses have a detrimental effect on the physical, mental and emotional bodies. When people learn to take relaxation breaks, built-up stress levels can be reduced. As stress is reduced, the nervous system works more coherently, and as a whole health is more easily maintained. With physical coherence, the two branches of the nervous systems are more balanced, creating synchronization between {{the heart and the}} brain, affecting all subsystems of the body. Another name for coherence or synchronization is entrainment. Shifts in entrainment levels reflect the coherence of the physiological autonomic nervous system. This study measured the heart rate variability and recorded the changes in resonant frequencies at seven areas around the head and heart chakra. As the heart rate variability pattern reduces, the nervous system becomes more balanced and less stressed, and the coherence and entrainment increases. Participants in this study practiced their own relaxation techniques, and the results were recorded both in <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratios</b> and resonant frequency shifts.

We comprehensively study a constant area ejector using analytical, experimental and numerical tools at low <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> (0. 004 - 0. 065) with Air, Helium and Argon as secondary gas while the primary gas is Air. For the first time, limits of operating parameters used in control volume method {{to design the}} ejector {{are found to be}} highly dependent on the secondary molecular weight. The <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> in the ejector (low for Helium and high for Argon) is affected by the molecular weight and the static pressure within the ejector (low for Air and high for Argon & Helium) by the gamma of the secondary gas. Sufficient suction pressure (0. 3 - 0. 55 bar) is generated by the ejector thereby preventing any backflow of secondary gas at all primary stagnation pressures (1. 5, 2. 2 and 3. 1 bar).

Velocity and temperature measurements were made with a single X-wire probe thermo-anemometry technique, using multi-overheat sequences to deliver simultaneous velocity-temperature data at high frequency. The spatial resolution was found fine enough, in relation with the dissipative scale and the thermal diffusive scale, to avoid false mixing enhancement in the analysis of the physical mechanisms through velocity-temperature coupling in statistical turbulence quantities. PDFs and Joint PDFs were used to distinguish between the different mechanisms involved in turbulent mixing, namely entrain-ment, engulfing, nibbling and mixing, and point to the contribution of entrainment in the mixing process. When comparing an unstably stratified configuration to its stably stratified equivalent, no significant difference could be seen in the PDF and JPDF quantities, but a conditional analysis based on temperature thresholding enabled a separation between mixed fluid and two distinct sets of events associated with unmixed fluid entrained from the hot and cold sides of the mixing layer into the mixing layer. This separation allowed a direct calculation of the entrainment velocities on both sides of the mixing layer. A significant increase of the total entrainment could be seen in the case of unstably stratified configuration. The <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratios</b> were compared to their prediction by the Dimotakis model and both a rather good relevance of the model and some need for improvement were found from the comparison.

40|$|Jet flows are {{prevalent}} in indoor environment and other engineering applications. Typical examples in indoor environment include the flow discharged from personal ventilation systems, and the jet exhaled through breathing or coughing. When there is density (or temperature) {{difference between the}} jet and surroundings, jet flow becomes stratified jet. Due to its complication, stratified jet flow is difficult to model, especially in the developing or transitional region of the flow. Studying stratified jet flows is of great significance for understanding the mixing dynamics of jet and ambient environment. This is particularly important for optimizing indoor environment design, or obtaining accurate boundary conditions in indoor air flow simulations. ^ Various turbulence models {{have been used to}} simulate stratified flows. This investigation systematically evaluated the performance of seven turbulence models under different turbulence levels and stratification levels, by comparing simulation results with experimental data. Mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent shear stress were examined in the comparisons. Mean square error values were used to quantify the evaluation. For the weakly stratified jet, all seven models could predict well the mean velocity, but for the strongly stratified jet, the Reynolds stress model and LES overpredicted the velocity in the unstable stratification region. SST k-ω was the overall best model. This investigation also analyzed the computing costs of the models as well as the vorticity and <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratios</b> predicted in the simulation. ^ This study introduced a new dynamic turbulent Schmidt number model which can determine turbulent Schmidt number based on local flow structure. The proposed model can improve the prediction of density distribution especially at downstream locations, although it takes 10 % additional computing time. ^ Furthermore, this study developed a CFD model to investigate gasper-induced jet flow. The results indicated that the jet centerline velocity profile could collapse into a universal curve after normalization; meanwhile, the lateral velocity profiles at downstream locations followed self-similarity rule. Based on that, the study proposed two models to predict normalized velocity at jet centerline, and lateral velocity at downstream locations, respectively. A flow rate model was also developed to predict the mainstream flow rates at various downstream locations of gasper-induced jet. The CFD model and developed flow rate model were further used {{to assess the impact of}} gasper on air quality in the breathing zones of passengers. ...|$|R
40|$|Meteorological {{models for}} {{numerical}} weather prediction or climate simulation require a description of land surface exchange processes. The degree of complexity of these land-surface parameterization schemes - or SVAT's - that is necessary for accurate model predictions, is yet unclear. Also, the calibration of these SVAT's for relatively complex terrain, such as sparse canopies, is not completely resolved. This thesis pays attention to {{the sensitivity of the}} atmospheric boundary layer to the parameterization of surface exchange processes for a sparse canopy surface. During two experimental campaigns carried out in a sparsely vegetated vineyard surface in La Mancha, Spain, detailed measurements were collected, including the flux densities of sensible, soil and latent heat, radiative fluxes, aerodynamic properties, and soil and vegetation characteristics. These measurements were used for calibration and validation of various SVAT-models and their components. In a theoretical analysis the traditional treatment of aerodynamic transport of heat and moisture between a sparse canopy surface and the atmosphere was considered, and compared by an alternative formulation based on Lagrangian diffusion theory. An analysis of field observations was carried out to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of the surface albedo of a sparsely vegetated surface. Furthermore, a model for the stomatal conductance, based on the calculation of leaf photosynthesis and its relations with stomatal water vapour transport, was tested and scaled- up to the canopy level. Various existing SVAT's, designed for sparse canopies, were described and compared to field measurements in a zero-dimensional mode, that is, with forcings measured at reference height close above the surface. These models were all based on different physical treatment of soil heat flux, aerodynamic exchange and canopy resistance. None of the included models gave an optimum description of the observed fluxes, but a model could be constructed that combined the best parts of each of these SVAT's. In an additional model study, this new description has been coupled to a onedimensional planetary boundary-layer (PBL) model. Parts of the SVAT were replaced by other components, and the impact on simulated PBL-dynamics has been evaluated. Large effects are found when (a) the reference two-layer model was replaced with a single layer ('big leaf') model, (b) soil heat flux was simulated with a resistance scheme rather than a diffusion or force-restore scheme, and (c) the aerodynamic resistance between the reference level and the bare soil was chosen too low. Since vegetation cover was small, smaller effects resulted from an alteration of the canopy resistance formulation.

For various combinations of venting velocity and smoke layer temperature, critical smoke layer thickness for onset of entrainment was identified by eye-observation. Air <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> {{was measured by}} the change of carbon dioxide concentration in smoke layer (before entrainment) and in exhaust duct (after entrainment). By summarizing the measured results, the followings were clarified. 1) The critical thickness for onset of entrainment depends on smoke layer temperature and largely on smoke layer thickness. When the smoke layer is thick, large venting velocity is needed to cause air entrainment. In this condition, flow into vent opening can be approximated by potential flow to point sink. As the smoke layer thickness is decreased, relatively small venting velocity can cause air entrainment. In this condition, flow pattern can be approximated by potential flow to line sink or to plane sink depending on aspect ratio. 2) Even at the critical condition determined by eye-observation, certain amount of air is entrained. 3) Beyond the critical condition, air <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> can be approximated by the fraction of actual smoke layer thickness to critical smoke layer thickness for onset of visible air entrainment...|$|E
40|$|For the {{presentation}} {{and analysis of}} atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) data, scales are used to non-dimensionalise the observed quantities and independent variables. Usually, the ABL height, surface sensible heat flux and surface scalar flux are used. This works well, {{so long as the}} absolute values of the <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> for both the scalar and temperature are similar. The <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> for temperature naturally ranges from ¿ 0. 4 to ¿ 0. 1. However, the <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> for passive scalars can vary widely in magnitude and sign. Then the entrainment flux becomes relevant as well. The only customary scalar scale that takes into account both the surface flux and the entrainment flux is the bulk scalar scale, but this scale is not well-behaved for large negative entrainment ratios and for an <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> equal to ¿ 1. We derive a new scalar scale, using previously published large-eddy simulation results for the convective ABL. The scale is derived under the constraint that scaled scalar variance profiles are similar at those heights where the variance producing mechanisms are identical (i. e., either near the entrainment layer or near the surface). The new scale takes into account that scalar variance in the ABL is not only related to the surface flux of that scalar, but to the scalar entrainment flux as well. Furthermore, it takes into account that the production of variance by the entrainment flux is an order of magnitude larger than the production of variance by the surface flux (per unit flux). Other desirable features of the new scale are that it is always positive (which is relevant when scaling standard deviations) and that the scaled variances are always of order 1 ¿ 10...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{application of}} high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) {{is influenced by}} respiratory system mechanics, gas entrainment, adjustment of the ventilator controls and {{the configuration of the}} jet-airway interface. These factors have been investigated using an animal model, bench models and anaesthetised patients. The problems of airway pressure and gas flow measurement have also been examined. The results show that optimum oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination occur between 1 - 4 Hz. Chest wall resonance was obtained at ~ 5 Hz but this was not associated with any improvement in gas exchange. An anti-resonant mode was also noted at lower frequencies (~ 0. 8 Hz) which was associated with a deterioration in gas exchange. At higher frequencies (> 2 Hz), abdomen and thorax responded as separate compartments. A multi-compartment visco-elastic model is presented for the respiratory system. Entrainment was inversely dependent on jet duty cycle (DC) between 10 - 60 %, and ventilation frequency (between 1 - 10 Hz), but independent of drive pressure (DP). Maximum entrainment was obtained with DC values between 10 - 40 % and frequencies between 1 - 6 Hz. Airway pressure signals vary in morphology and peak, mean and trough levels according to position in the central airway. Pressure measurements have been standardised to a point 5 cm distal to the jet orifice. The morphology of this pressure signals reflects variations in load compliance, and flow resistance as well as local gas flow conditions. Peak pressures at this point are representative of more distal values. Trough (end expiratory) pressures are greater distally than proximally and are increased by increasing frequency, DC and DP controls. A low dead space, light weight pneumotachograph head has been designed and used to measure of expired and entrained volumes. This is based on a modified Pitot tube (MPT). Tidal volumes were dependent on DC and DP controls but inversely related to frequency. Tidal volumes and entrainment were both affected by the configuration of the jet-endotracheal tube (ETT) interface. The jet should not be situated < 5 cm from the distal end of ETT because of greatly reduced tidal and entrained volumes. Distal and proximal location of the jet represent two main variations in configuration. Distal injection was found to be less sensitive to reductions in load compliance, while proximal injection gave higher tidal volumes and <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratios</b> which were attenuated by reductions in load compliance more easily than in distal injection. Recommendations for clinical application of HFJV following from these results have been made and topics for future work are suggested...|$|R

The experiments employ a diffusion-limited acid-base reaction to directly measure the extent of mixing. Optical diagnostics used include laser absorption and laser induced fluorescence. Absorption of laser light by reacted product provides a measure of cross-stream average product. Fluorescence was measured by a self-scanning linear photodiode array using high speed computer data acquisition to obtain the product distribution across the layer. Previous results showing that forcing alters the {{structure and}} growth rate of shear layers are confirmed. Forcing artificially extends the lifetime of vortices whose size {{is consistent with the}} disturbance wavelength. Amalgamation of smaller vortices is enhanced over that in the natural layer until the frequency locked scale is achieved. At high Reynolds number product measurements show reduction of product with forcing. At moderate Reynolds numbers, on the other hand, there is an increase in product when forced. In one case a five fold increase in product was observed. The differences are related to the different effects of forcing on <b>entrainment,</b> composition <b>ratio</b> and secondary structure. A dramatic, order of magnitude increase in mixing was discovered for certain forced wake flows. This effect is strongly associated with an interaction between the spanwise organized wake vortices and the test-section side walls. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is used to}} describe and investigate the effects of simultaneous crystallization, radiation loss, and entrainment of cooler material on the temperature of a well-mixed core of an active aa lava flow. Entrainment of crust, levee debris, and base material into the interior of active flows has been observed, but the degree of assimilation and the thermal consequences are difficult to quantify. The rate of entrainment can be constrained by supplementing the {{theoretical model}} with information on the crystallization along {{the path of the}} flow and estimation of the radiative loss from the flow interior. Application of the model is demonstrated with the 1984 Mauna Loa flow, which was erupted about 30 C undercooled. Without any entrainment of cooler material, the high crystallization rates would have driven temperatures in the core wall above temperatures measured by thermocouple and estimated from glass geothermometry. One plausible scenario for this flow, which agrees with available temperature and crystallinity measurements, has a high initial rate of entrainment during the first 8 hours of travel (a mass ratio of entrained material to fluid core of about 15 % if the average temperature of the entrained material was 600 C), which counterbalances the latent heat from approximately 40 % crystallization. In this scenario, the model suggests an additional 5 % crystallization and a 5 % <b>entrainment</b> mass <b>ratio</b> over the subsequent 16 -hour period.

As expected, temperature and humidity showed a contrast between dry warm conditions and moister cooler conditions from one period to the other. Most of the time, the wind blew from the west (northwesterly to southwesterly) in the ABL and from the east in the free troposphere.

40|$|Several bulk model–based {{entrainment}} parameterizations for {{the atmospheric}} convective boundary layer (CBL) with wind shear are reviewed and tested against large-eddy simulation (LES) data {{to evaluate their}} ability to model {{one of the basic}} integral parameters of convective entrainment—the <b>entrainment</b> flux <b>ratio.</b> Test results indicate that many of these parameterizations fail to correctly reproduce entrainment flux in the presence of strong shear because they underestimate the dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) produced by shear in the entrainment zone. It is also found that surface shear generation of TKE may be neglected in the entrainment parameterization because it is largely balanced by dissipation. However, the surface friction has an indirect effect on the entrainment through the modification of momentum distribu-tion in the mixed layer and regulation of shear across the entrainment zone. Because of this effect, param-eterizations that take into account the surface friction velocity but exclude entrainment zone shear may sufficiently describe entrainment when wind shear in the free atmosphere above the CBL is small. In this case, the surface shear acts as a proxy for the entrainment zone shear. Such parameterizations can be most useful if applied in situations where atmospheric data are insufficient for calculating entrainment zone shear. The importance of modeling a Richardson-number-limited, finite-depth entrainment zone is evi-denced by the relatively accurate entrainment flux predictions by models that explicitly account for effects of entrainment zone shear, but predictions by these models are often adversely affected by the underesti-mation of TKE dissipation in the entrainment zone. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation of an R 744 liquid ejector {{applied to a}} supermarket refrigeration system. The use of the liquid ejector enables {{the operation of the}} evaporator in a flooded mode and recirculates the R 744 liquid phase, which improves the energy efficiency of the refrigeration system. The investigation was performed using two ejectors of different sizes installed in a multi-ejector block. The numerical model was formulated based on the homogenous equilibrium model and validated with the experimental results. The influence of the pre-mixer, mixer and diffuser dimensions on the ejector performance measured using the mass <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> is presented. The results show that the best liquid ejector performance was obtained for the short lengths of the pre-mixer and mixer compared to the broadly investigated two-phase ejectors connected to the evaporator port. In addition, wide diffuser angles improved the mass <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> of both liquid ejectors, which may lead to a reduction in the diffuser length...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} primary steam {{superheating}} on steam condensation in nozzle {{and the performance}} of steam ejector were investigated using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) method. Using a wet steam model being proposed in our previous study, simulations based on the primary steam with five superheated levels were performed, and the results demonstrate the superheating operation of the primary steam weakens the spontaneous condensation intensity and postpones its occurrence within the nozzle vicinity. Due to the droplets nucleation refinement for the condensation of superheated steam, the mixing process between the primary and the secondary fluids is improved. Consequently, a higher <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> is achieved. However, the superheating operation may not exceed 20 K, as its contribution on <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> improvement is not as significant as 0 K- 20 K superheating, and too much superheating will requires more energy as input, which is not a practical solution to further improve the steam ejector pumping performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of working fluids over the performance of heat driven ejector refrigeration systems performance by using a lumped parameter model. The model used has been selected after a comparison of different models {{with a set of}} experimental data available in the literature. The effect of generator, evaporator and condenser temperature over the <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> and the COP has been investigated for different working fluids in the typical operating conditions of low grade energy sources. The results show a growth in performance (the <b>entrainment</b> <b>ratio</b> and the COP) with a rise in the generator and evaporator temperature and a decrease in the condenser temperature. The working fluids have a great impact on the ejector performance and each refrigerant has its own range of operating conditions. R 134 a is found to be suitable for low generator temperature (70 - 100 degrees C), whereas the hydrocarbons R 600 is suitable for medium generator temperatures (100 - 130 degrees C) and R 601 for high generator temperatures (130 - 180 degrees C).

40|$|Entrainment of ambient fluid {{into both}} {{two-dimensional}} and axisymmetric gravity currents is investigated experimentally using a novel neutralization technique. The technique involves the titrative neutralization of an alkaline gravity current which intrudes into and entrains an acidic ambient, and is visualized using a pH indicator solution. Using this technique, {{we can determine}} quantitative results {{for the amount of}} dilution in the head of the current. The head of the current is able to entrain ambient fluid both by shear instabilities on the current/ambient interface and by over-riding (relatively light) ambient fluid. Guided by our experimental observations, we present two slightly different theoretical models to determine the entrainment into the head of the current as a function of distance from the source for the instantaneous release of a constant volume of fluid in a two-dimensional geometry. By dimensional analysis, we determine from both models that the dimensionless <b>entrainment</b> or dilution <b>ratio,</b> E, defined as the ratio of the volumes of ambient and original fluid in the head, is independent of the initial reduced gravity of the current; and this result is confirmed by our experiments in Boussinesq situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock is}} an endogenous 24 hour rhythm that helps organisms anticipate and adapt to daily and seasonal variations in environment, {{such as the}} day/night cycle or changing temperatures. The plant clock is a complex network of transcription factors that regulate each other, forming interlocked feedback loops. Most of its components are light-regulated in some way, making the system highly sensitive to changes in light conditions. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which the plant clock adapts to changing day length. We first present some experimental data illustrating the variety of behaviors found in seedlings exposed to external day/night cycles different from 24  h. We then use a mathematical model to characterize {{the response of the}} clock {{to a wide range of}} external cycle lengths and photoperiods. We show the existence of several domains of periodic <b>entrainment</b> with different <b>ratios</b> between the external cycle length and the period of the clock, and the presence of quasiperiodic and chaotic behaviors outside of the entrainment range. We simulate knockout mutants with impaired clock function and theoretical variants with diminished light sensitivity to highlight the role of a complex network and multiple light inputs in keeping the clock entrained over a wide range of conditions.

40|$|Background. Patient-ventilator {{synchrony}} is a {{major concern}} in critical care and is influenced by phasic lung-volume feedback control of the respiratory rhythm. Routine clinical application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) introduces a tonic input which, if unopposed, might disrupt respiratory-ventilator entrainment through sustained activation of the vagallymediated Hering-Breuer reflex. We suggest that this potential adverse effect may be averted by two differentiator forms of nonassociative learning (habituation and desensitization) of the Hering-Breuer reflex via pontomedullary pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings. We tested these hypotheses in 17 urethane-anesthetized adult Sprague-Dawley rats under controlled mechanical ventilation. Without PEEP, phrenic discharge was entrained 1 : 1 to the ventilator rhythm. Application of PEEP momentarily dampened the <b>entrainment</b> to higher <b>ratios</b> but this effect was gradually adapted by nonassociative learning. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the pneumotaxic center weakened the adaptation to PEEP, whereas sustained stimulation of the pneumotaxic center weakened the entrainment independent of PEEP. In all cases, entrainment was abolished after vagotomy. Conclusions/Significance. Our results demonstrate an important functional role for pneumotaxic desensitization and extra-pontine habituation of the Hering-Breuer reflex elicited by lung inflation: acting as buffers or high-pass filters against tonic vagal volume input, these differentiator forms of nonassociative learning help to restore respiratory-ventilator entrainment in the face of PEEP. Such central sites-specific habituation and desensitization of the Hering-Breuer reflex provide a useful experimental model of nonassociative learning in mammals that is of particula...|$|R
