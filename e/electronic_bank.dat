Subjects were Northern Illinois University students preparing for careers in human and family support services. The sample consisted of 84 female and 16 male students. Indexes measured locus of control and intention to use ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> and a scale measured attitude toward the use of ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking.</b> Correlations and multiple regression were used to explore relationships among variables. It was hypothesized that stronger intention to use ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> could be predicted from the combination of internal locus of control and positive attitude toward ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking,</b> and selected demographic variables. Further, it was hypothesized that selected demographic variables would be related to locus of control and attitude. Preservice social service professionals with more positive attitudes toward using ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> had a stronger intention to use ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking.</b> The ability to predict intention to ?ge ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> was due primarily to this strong positive relationship between attitude and intention. No relationships were found between locus of control and either attitude or intention toward ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking.</b> In separate analyses, it was found that beliefs about locus of control and using ATMs accurately predicted overall attitude toward ATM/debit card <b>electronic</b> <b>banking.</b> Some specific beliefs were more accurate than others in predicting attitude and intention.

It was recommended that financial institutions investigate marketing techniques that promote positive attitudes toward ATM/debit cards. Research to determine social services professionals? perceptions of their role in financial counseling of clients was recommended. Consumer educators should plan courses with flexible content reflecting trends in financial services and providing "hands-on" experience.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The current {{competitive}} climate {{within the}} South African banking industry has {{put pressure on}} banks to either find new revenue streams mainly through innovation, or to achieve existing cost efficiencies. South African banks have increasingly looked to advancements in new technology, innovation and service distribution channels as a solution for attaining sustainable competitive advantage. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate and assess the independent variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived cost, perceived privacy/ security and knowledgeability/ awareness) that influence the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> channels in order to inform banks’ channel migration strategy decisions. The study attempts to close the gap in <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> adoption theory that exists within a South African context. The significance of the study is that due to a majority of <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> adoption research and models being conducted internationally, an attempt is made to investigate and apply these models within a South African context. Based on a survey conducted among 211 respondents, the above mentioned independent and dependent variables under study were examined. The analyses revealed significant demographic and behavioural findings between the independent variables that influence consumer adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> channels. The perceived privacy/security variable was found to be responsible for the highest frequency of branch visits by clients mainly due to the perception that <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> channels are not safe to use. The independent variable, perceived usefulness, was found to have the strongest positive correlation with the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> channels. These results imply that in addition to the importance of addressing privacy and security concerns associated with <b>electronic</b> <b>banking,</b> banks need to focus on improving consumer usefulness and value perceptions in their <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> offerings...|$|R
