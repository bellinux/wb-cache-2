30|$|For the <b>exploration</b> of <b>submarine</b> {{hydrothermal}} ore deposits over wide areas, {{efficiency is}} crucially important (e.g., Yoerger et al. 2007). Geophysical mapping methods, which continuously observe signals {{away from the}} seafloor, {{might be the best}} choice for this purpose. Using a deep-towed array, we have demonstrated that the self-potential method, which measures in situ electrostatic potential (e.g., Jouniaux and Ishido 2012; Revil and Jardani 2013), works effectively to locate seafloor hydrothermal ore deposits (Kawada and Kasaya 2017). The observed self-potential signals are likely to detect redox reactions occurring around an ore body as a negative self-potential anomaly above it (Sato and Mooney 1960). The self-potential method is particularly efficient in marine environments because towing two or more non-polarized electrodes reveals in situ electrostatic fields. Although this method is not used very commonly in marine environments at present, it has been investigated continually since the 1970 s (e.g., Beltenev et al. 2009; Brewitt-Taylor 1975; Cherkashev et al. 2013; Constable et al. 2018; Corwin 1976; Francis 1985; Heinson et al. 1999, 2005; Kawada and Kasaya 2017; Petersen and Shipboard Scientific Party 2016; Safipour et al. 2017; Von Herzen et al. 1996). The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) greatly improves the efficiency of the self-potential survey (Constable et al. 2018; Sato et al. 2017). Sato et al. (2017) only measured self-potential. Constable et al. (2018) conducted combined observations of self-potential and electromagnetic surveys. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to map the difference in response between self-potential and turbidity using this high efficiency.|$|R

It even has been deduced that only the Geophysical Field of Earth (GFE) referencing methods (UMN is a typical one) can enable Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) to navigate accurately over large areas [4, 5].

Moving well beyond its initial base in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting, oceanmapping has become a critical component of offshore oil <b>exploration</b> and development, <b>submarine</b> cable routing and installation, and geologic and essential fish habitat mapping. The technology of oceanmapping has blossomed rapidly in the past decade with the introduction of multibeam sonar, high-resolution side scan sonar, airborne lidar bathymeters, and laser line scan recorders. The next decade will likely see increased demand for ocean mapping data and continued demand for even more sophisticated ocean mapping technology.

40|$|ItNel corso del 2005 sono state organizzate tre spedizioni speleosubacquee italo-slovene nel golfo di Kotor (Repubblica Jugoslava del Montenegro). Le immersioni e gli studi eseguiti, nonché i reperti archeologici ritrovati hanno permesso di ricostruire il contesto idrogeologico nel quale si inseriscono le cavità oggetto di esplorazione (Potor, Spilja, Gurdic e Ljuta) e di delineare, nel tempo, l’uso antropico delle stesse. Le cavità sono state oggetto di rilievi accurati e per ciascuna si è cercato di ricostruire il presunto bacino idrogeologico di appartenenza; inoltre con specifiche immersioni nelle zone delle risorgenze a mare si è avuto modo di osservare e documentare le particolari caratteristiche degli ecosistemi subacquei presenti. EnIn 2005 three Italian Slovenian speleological expeditions {{have been}} {{organized}} in Kotor Gulf (Republic of Montenegro). The studies performed and the cave diving activity allowed {{to reconstruct the}} hydrogeological situation of the explored caves (Potor, Spilja, Gurdic and Ljuta). Topographical survey was made in these caves. For each of them the original hydrogeological basin was hypothesized. Moreover, the local ecosystems features were observed and documented in marine resurgence by specific dives. In detail, the Sopot Cave is constituted by a pressure flow tube opening, after a hundred meters, in the sub vertical big chamber: the siphon opens between the blocks. The diving cave system is made by a passage and wells at intervals. Diameter is rarely below 6 - 8 m, {{at least in the}} first part. Rapidly after the entrance, depth settles around - 70 m (about - 40 / 50 m in normal conditions water). After a hundred meters a flat-lying passage leads to a narrow between the blocks. The karstic system, which includes Sopot, is relied with an important intermittent submarine spring (sea estavelle), through which one can pass at 30 m depth (in April 2005 – flow 15 - 20 m 3 per second has been estimated) and which is about 300 m from the entrance. During diving <b>exploration</b> of <b>submarines</b> springs, a unique ecosystem has been found, which deserves further study. As a matter of fact, low temperature fresh waters exit, strong mixing of waters, turbidity and poor brightness typical of these sites favours growth in shallow waters (around 15 - 20 m) of a true "forest" of Gerardia savaglia, with Aplysina aerophoba, Parazoanthus axinellae, Cerianthus membranaceus, Flabellina affinis, and Cratena peregrina. Inside the cavity, in an area of material accumulation, fragments of Venetian ceramics (especially from Venice), datable between the second half of 1500 and the first of 1600, were found. This finding is particularly interesting because it documents of human presence of a cave for water supply at least since XVI century up to recent times. The Spilja spring is located near Risan and represents exsurgence of a karstic complex N-NE of the entrance. The cave is located {{at the end of a}} polje, which, in case of flood, is run by an impetuous torrent. The aerial part of the cave is formed by a pressure flow tube with elliptical section two meters high and ten meters large. With the same characteristics, the principal passage continues also in underwater ambiance. In the first trait, sections get lager and go down slowly to - 18 m. Gallery then goes up to - 3 m and keeps this depth for about 80 m. Then it goes progressively down to - 72 m. The Gurdic system is really very complex with an ample front presenting several accesses, starting from Kotor walls. The principal spring (an estavelle in fact) has an easy entrance, facing south, besides the principal road along the fortification walk. The cave (in the part explored in 2005) is exclusively underwater and pours its waters directly into the sea. In summer period, the submarine spring is flood by sea salted waters (sea estavelle). In the initial lake, of great size, fresh and salt waters mix giving the typical halocline effect...|$|R
40|$|The thesis work, {{with the}} openly {{published}} journal and conference papers, {{is motivated by}} the ambition to interact over time with the scientific community {{in the development of}} a novel coherent submarine design method to regain momentum in Swedish submarine computer aided Simulation Based Design (SBD). The work was initially stimulated by an early observation in our submarine engineering community, that the existing knowledge of naval architecture and systems theory including cost prediction and operational analysis was not coherently utilised for the design of Naval Integrated Complex System (NICS), hence the need for a coherent approach. The work is based on the idea that a coherent method works better by generating reliable information for the decision makers early in a project. The problem was to develop a user-oriented method that fully utilises existing knowledge in the submarine engineering community and reaches acceptance by submarine design engineers and the customers and recognition from the scientific community. There are four main contributions to the coherent method in this thesis. Firstly, there is an integrated domain driven design approach for a technical description of the design object, the related system cost and system effect. Secondly, the uses of a generic design object to stimulate the operational analysis simulation and from there extract tactically driven system functions and requirements. Thirdly, the use of a synthesised operational environment, i. e. a war gaming event based Monte Carlo operational analysis simulation model including tactical and behavioural rules in establishing design objects system effectiveness under diverse conditions. Fourthly, the utilisation of the combined set of tools in the coherent method provides the designer with the possibility to generate, explore and analyse and evaluate a large number of competing feasible Play-Cards and concepts in search of the best satisfying designs. The work has resulted in a parametric and concept <b>exploration</b> model for <b>submarine</b> design including a model for cost calculation. A simulation model with an event based and Monte Carlo operational analysis is supporting the systems analysis for evaluation of a complete submarine system. The coherent method with its models and methods provides an integrated computation and analysis environment for efficient work in the early phases and to develop the design objects from needs to a complete concept for further development during the preliminary design phase. The coherent method makes it possible to search for best satisfying designs in the identified design room within the design space by working with models in the functional domain, based on identified needs and deduced and designed requirements aggregated in a representation of a submarine, the Play-Card with its system functions and functional volumes. In a broader aspect, the same methodology can be adapted to handle integrated complex systems in general e. g. ships and airplanes. The methods used in the coherent method have been verified in several steps. First by the FMV/FOI development team based on control calculations of the methods based on accepted theories, the model tests and acceptance and full scale test reports. The methods have also been examined and validated by design teams at industry and research institutions. In all cases, this has led to successful results with a high compliance to verifiable values and the coherent model has been proven useful for its purpose in the early phases...|$|R
40|$|Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik is {{one major}} global {{player in the}} multibeam business. The multibeam systems are marketed under the {{well-known}} brand name SeaBeam, including systems for medium water depth and deep-water areas. The ELAC SeaBeam 3012 / 3020 deep-water systems operate in the 12 kHz and 20 kHz frequency bands, whereas the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 medium-depth systems operate in the 30 kHz and 50 kHz frequency bands. While formerly only continuous wave (CW) pulses were applied, the new Mk II series of the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam systems offer the possibility to apply frequencymodulated (FM) pulses for increased measurement ranges, improved range resolution and better data quality. FM pulses require a correlation of the beamformed data of all beam directions with pulse replica {{in order to obtain}} pulse compression. Additionally, Doppler shifts of the operating frequencies induced by the ship’s movement have to be compensated. In order to obtain unrivalled data quality, the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam ystems apply Doppler compensation not only on the bathymetric depth data, but also on the water column imaging (WCI) data. In order to provide high data density, all ELAC SeaBeam MBES can transmit two quasisimultaneous swaths per ping cycle, which are frequency-separated. Compared to the singleping mode, the data density is doubled. The ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam systems include a functionality for to automatic cyclical steering of the transmitted swaths in the along-ship direction. Via this functionality, which is called “Advanced Transmission Beam Steering”, an entire volume below the vessel can be insonified without requiring any movement of the vessel. The operator can specify an angle range and an angle increment, resulting in a periodic oscillation of the transmitted swaths from bow to aft and vice versa. This functionality is very helpful for the detection and analysis of gas flares, leakages or other objects in the water column during stationary vessel operation or on fixed platforms. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik GmbH Page 2 of 3 31. May 2016 On order to provide highest operational flexibility, the ELAC SeaBeam 3050 and ELAC SeaBeam 3030 are available as mobile systems, providing the sonar electronics in flight cases and utilizing mobile transducer brackets for spatial resolutions of 1. 5 ° x 2 ° for ELAC SeaBeam 3050 and 3 ° x 2 ° for ELAC SeaBeam 3030. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik is the only supplier, offering a mobile 30 kHz multibeam of the sea water profile and sea water surface will be designed, studied, developed and applied to a real situation.

Nowadays, this techique is used in many infraestructures as bridge or airports by never has been used in sea, where the sea currents and biofouling are problems that will are wtudied at the project. However the optical fibers must been calibrated to know the uncertainty in temperature measure, and it is the purpose of the paper. system with a depth performance of more than 6, 000 meters. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik is a main industrial partner within the German „Lighthouse“ Research Project SUGAR (Submarine Gas Hydrate Reservoirs) and cooperates with the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik participates in a SUGAR subproject, which is related to gas flare detection. Gas flares at the seabed are indicators for potential gas hydrate reservoirs and potential leakages of gas deposits. Therefore, gas flare detection is important for the <b>exploration</b> of <b>submarine</b> gas hydrates and for environmental monitoring. Driven by the SUGAR project, the ELAC SeaBeam multibeam systems store WCI data with very high resolution. For the online and offline visualization of high-resolution WCI data, the ELAC WCI Viewer is utilized, providing different window types for data visualization, different scaling and range options, forward and backward data playback as movies or single pictures, object and event functionalities and the display of external sensor data. These capabilities help to identify and analyze any kinds of objects in the water column or on the bottom (e. g. gas seeps). Despite helpful aids for the online visualization of high-resolution WCI data, there is a need for an automatic processing of WCI data with respect to object detection. Such automatic processing will reduce the workload of survey operators significantly. Therefore, Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik has developed an automatic object detector (ELAC AOD) which is dedicated to gas flares in the water column. Due to the huge data volumes of high-resolution WCI data, the development of the ELAC AOD was ambitious and challenging. The ELAC AOD was implemented within the MATLAB development environment. The ELAC AOD is dedicated to WCI data from ELAC SeaBeam 3030 and 3050 medium-depth multibeam systems and stores all relevant information of detected objects in so-called object log files. It is possible to import such object log files into the ELAC WCI Viewer for visualization purposes. Due to the above-mentioned characteristics, multibeam systems from Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik are excellently applicable in order to detect and analyze gas flares in the water column. The presentation will provide detailed system information and important data examples. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
