5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E
25|$|While on {{a hunting}} trip in 1989 at Taylor Ranch in Colorado, Parker met Oklahoma City {{businessman}} Robert A. Funk. After Funk discovered that Parker was a wildlife artist, he asked Parker {{if he had}} any examples of his work to show him. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened that the artist had an elk bust sculpture called Perfection in his truck and, after showing it to Funk, a sale was consummated on the spot for the sculpture. Parker would meet Funk again at the C. M. Russell Art Show in 1999 and some years later he suggested to Funk that he could design a sculpture of a Clydesdale horse to be given as an award to exemplary employees of Funk's Express Employment Professionals company in Oklahoma City. A deal was struck between the two that resulted in Parker casting a now sold out 50-piece edition called Express Ranch Clydesdale. Over time, Funk has added several more Parker sculptures to his collection, including a monumental bronze elk sculpture for the entrance to his New Mexico ranch.|$|E

500|$|Reshoots were {{conducted}} around November 2007. Lawrence noted, [...] "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until {{about a month}} ago. The movie starts {{to take on a}} whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Various musicians collaborated {{during the}} {{recording}} of Auf der Maur. Former bandmates Eric Erlandson and James Iha performed guitar on [...] "Would If I Could" [...] and [...] "Skin Receiver," [...] respectively, Mark Lanegan provided additional vocals to [...] "Taste You," [...] and Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme played guitar on four songs and backing vocals on [...] "Skin Receiver." [...] Speaking of the contributions, Auf der Maur said: [...] "I am so lucky I have all these talented friends. It is not too hard to find musicians who are available to play. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens the most generous people are also the best and were willing to play." [...] During the earlier stages of recording, a duet with Rufus Wainwright was also considered.|$|E
500|$|In {{their early}} years the {{perceived}} stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as 'silverhighchair', 'not Soundgarden but ' or 'Nirvana in Pyjamas' by the Australian media. The latter is a sarcastic conflated {{reference to the}} band's youth and the popular Australian children's TV series Bananas in Pyjamas. McFarlane stated [...] "Freak Show and tracks like 'Freak' were firmly in Nirvana territory {{with a hint of}} Led Zeppelin's Eastern mysticism". Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the Seattle Sound, as well as The Beatles and The Doors, and were highly impressionable in their youth. Johns admitted that [...] "We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened that we weren't very good at playing that style of music. So we were put in the whole grunge category because it was such a garage-y, heavy music term." ...|$|E

Her voice is effortless. It's badass, like, 'I know I'm the best.' I love the melody, I love the cadence. It's playful, but <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> in-your-face. <b>It's</b> dope and it's creative." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{compilation}} of Orbison's most successful songs updated and re-recorded {{was released in}} 1987 under the title In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. It coincided {{with the release of}} the dark and surreal mystery thriller Blue Velvet, [...] directed by David Lynch. Orbison was astonished at the way Lynch used [...] "In Dreams". In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel meant something to him. And <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable. But I can see why Roy was upset because for him it meant a third thing." ...|$|E
500|$|That same year, Coulter {{joined forces}} with {{previous}} Australian Idol contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo {{to be part of}} the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's single [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, DeAraugo stated that they are [...] "not an Idol supergroup, it's just about finding four female voices. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened the four we've gone with are all from Idol. The single is just to promote the tour, just to show a taste of what will be on there, but there won't be an album". Young Divas' version of [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] peaked at numbertwo and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's [...] "Happenin' All Over Again". The song peaked at numbernine and was certified gold.|$|E
500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as [...] "very focused," [...] and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive [...] "group" [...] atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return {{the next day to}} sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that [...] "I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happened that Kanye was excited by that." [...] Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated:It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, it would all be edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, he kind of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial," [...] several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no [...] "bass wobbles" [...] reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as [...] "very raw" [...] by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was [...] "rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually." [...] While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as [...] "the fastest record we ever made." [...] In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the [...] "final product," [...] (only later to be changed) describing the album as [...] "dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that criticisms {{regarding}} the MBTI mostly come down to questions regarding the validity of its origins, not questions regarding the validity of the MBTI's usefulness. [...] Others argue that the MBTI can be a reliable measurement of personality; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens that [...] "like all measures, the MBTI yields scores that are dependent on sample characteristics and testing conditions".|$|E
2500|$|Michael Jerryson, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Ohio's Youngstown State University and {{co-editor of}} the book Buddhist Warfare, said that [...] "Buddhism differs in {{that the act of}} killing is less the focus than the 'intention' behind the killing" [...] and [...] "The first thing to {{remember}} is that people have a penchant for violence, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens that every religion has people in it." ...|$|E
5000|$|We were {{recording}} another number Sticks; we’d {{just finished}} a take and John Bonham did the drum intro and we just followed on. I started doing pretty much half of that riff you hear on Rock n Roll and <b>it</b> was <b>just</b> <b>so</b> exciting that we thought, [...] "let’s just work on this". The riff and the sequence was really immediate to those 12-bar patterns that you had in those old rock songs like Little Richard, etc, and <b>it</b> was <b>just</b> <b>so</b> spur-of-the-moment the way that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> came together more or less out of nowhere.|$|R

The movie damns all paparazzi as parasitical villains." [...] -- Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian Flick {{awarded the}} album 3½ stars stating [...] "Overall, {{this is a}} very strange album and {{although}} it's not a hard or really taxing listen, <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> off the wall I'm not sure I get <b>it.</b> There's <b>just</b> this atmosphere of pure strangeness that I just can't put my finger on whether this is good, bad, or just decent.

2500|$|Hopkins {{resides in}} Malibu, California. He {{had moved to}} the US once before during the late 1970s to pursue his film career, but {{returned}} to London in the late 1980s. However, he decided to return to the US following his 1990s success. Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalised US citizen on 12 April 2000, with Hopkins stating: [...] "I have dual citizenship; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happens I live in America".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{frequently}} {{being considered}} {{as part of}} the gothic rock genre, Sain did not view the music as such, though he did credit its listeners with discovering many noteworthy bands: [...] "Goth is an important doorway for lots of things that would not be accepted easily anywhere else. For example, who were the first people to embrace the Sugarcubes? Goths. And now we have a megastar of Björk. Pixies 1988? Gothic audience, not fratboys. Einsturzende Neubaten walked in through the [...] "gothic" [...] door—Miranda Sex Garden—Cocteau Twins. It's no wonder nobody can agree on what [...] "Gothic" [...] means... depth and dissonance and polite confrontationalism are quite possibly the only denominators....

5000|$|Politics was a {{topic that}} Mayer had not {{previously}} tackled. On his decision to include a politically tinged song, he commented, [...] "You cannot avoid war in life, you cannot avoid the fear of terrorism, you cannot avoid those things now, {{they are a part}} of everyday demeanor.
