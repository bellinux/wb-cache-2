50|$|For gas appliances, a flame {{supervision}} device (FSD) - alternative name: <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device (FFD) - is {{a general}} term for any device designed to stop flammable gas going to the burner of a gas appliance if the flame is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room. Causes of <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the draught from an oven door being opened and closed.|$|R

50|$|The intense {{ionization}} {{within the}} body of a flame can be measured by means of a current that flows when a voltage is applied by the phenomena of Flame Rectification. This current can be used to verify flame presence and quality. Such detectors are used in large industrial process gas heaters and are connected to the flame control system. They usually act as both flame quality monitors and for <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> detection.|$|R
50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame {{is between the}} front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|R

50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot <b>flame</b> <b>failure,</b> but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|R

5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device for gas hobs and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Variceal {{bleeding}} is {{a serious}} complication in patients with cirrhosis. Among the criteria that were proposed in Baveno conferences, the Adjusted Blood Requirement Index (ABRI) has not been validated prospectively in clinical practice. We therefore aim to evaluate the measurement of ABRI as a marker of <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> bleeding and to evaluate the consistency of ABRI {{in relation to other}} criteria of <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> variceal bleeding. Patients and methods: All patients with variceal bleeding who presented to Aga Khan University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2012 who were administered transfusion of packed red blood cells were included after obtaining informed consent. All patients were managed as per the standard protocol with intravenous terlipressin along with band ligation and injection of cyanoacrylate in cases of esophageal and fundal varices, respectively. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured every 6 [*]h for 48 [*]h and then every 12 [*]h until 5 days of index bleed in each patient. Packed cells were transfused if hemoglobin decreased below 8 [*]g/dl. The number of blood units transfused, change in hemoglobin values, and ABRI were calculated after each unit of blood transfusion till 120 [*]h. In patients in whom bleed could not be controlled, an ABRI value of 0. 75 or more was compared with other Baveno IV-based parameters that define <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> variceal bleeding. Results: During the study period, 137 eligible patients with variceal bleed were admitted. The mean age of the patients was 52 ± 12 years. The majority of patients (50. 4 %) were in Child–Pugh class B, followed by 38 % in Child–Pugh class C. According to the Baveno IV criteria, overall <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> acute variceal bleeding occurred in 52 (37. 9 %) patients. Excluding ABRI, <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> bleeding was found in 22 / 137 (16 %) patients, whereas ABRI-based criteria showed that in 34 / 137 (24. 8 %) patients, bleeding could not be controlled. There were only four (2. 9 %) patients with variceal bleeding in whom ABRI and other additional Baveno IV-based criteria for <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> bleeding were present. When ABRI was compared with other criteria for <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> bleeding, it showed a sensitivity and specificity of 19 and 25 %, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed that ABRI is not a useful additional tool to define <b>failure</b> to <b>control</b> bleeding after variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{engineers}} proposed to use Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) as a strengthening material to retrofit masonry structures. In order to accurately and conservatively predict the overall capabilities of FRP-strengthened masonry structures, the basic characteristic of shear debonding must be first studied and understood.

40|$|When {{a severe}} service failure occurs, {{loss to the}} firm is {{generally}} inevitable, but {{little research has been}} conducted on how to control the frequency of severe service failure. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a service <b>failure</b> <b>control</b> process and model by assessing whether the failure frequency in various service failure categories meets minimum tolerance levels. An initial restaurant-related service failure classification model was constructed based on literature review and expert suggestions. The present study applies the fuzzy Delphi Method to screen these initial restaurant-related service failure categories to produce a formal restaurant-related service failure classification model. Next, a questionnaire survey is used to collect data of the frequency and severity of service failure categories. The tolerable upper limits for the frequency of service failures are determined according to the severity of each category. Service failure indices are defined, and a statistical method is used to test whether failure indices values of various categories meet the required level for the business. An illustrative example of a restaurant chain is used to demonstrate the process of implementing the service <b>failure</b> <b>control</b> model. The results show that the restaurant had seven unqualified failure categories and corresponding priorities for improvement, which can help to establish a service quality improvement strategy and resource allocation plan.
