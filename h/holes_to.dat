5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling {{deep into the}} earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> open in the earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E
5|$|Small rodents {{form the}} largest {{part of the}} least weasel's diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits, other mammals, and {{occasionally}} birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and summer, and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation.

Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. Because they are so common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E
5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow routed through several black <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> mask its point of origin.|$|E

5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom of each of these <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the history of}} clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> be kept to a minimum, restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good tone. In 1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder. It was airtight and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes. Müller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys. This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th-century makers made many enhancements to Müller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads.|$|E

5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening <b>holes</b> <b>to</b> reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
