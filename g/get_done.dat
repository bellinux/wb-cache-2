After winning the race, Hamlin described his disappointment by saying, [...] "The car took off and it was game-over, Everyone's got a little fight in them, especially when they <b>get</b> <b>done</b> wrong. After our performance today, it's easy to put yesterday behind me.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to overseeing {{the release of}} the Concert for Bangladesh documentary film prevented him from being able to start on the follow-up to his All Things Must Pass triple album until midway through 1972. Another delay was caused by producer Phil Spector's unreliability, as Harrison waited for him to turn up {{for the start of the}} sessions. Author Bruce Spizer writes that [...] "the eccentric producer's erratic attendance caused George to realize the project would never <b>get</b> <b>done</b> if he kept waiting for Spector", and by October that year, Harrison had decided to produce the album alone.|$|E

500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I <b>get</b> <b>done</b> playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to <b>get</b> <b>done,</b> called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E
500|$|Eight {{visual effects}} {{companies}} {{worked on the}} film's 800 effects shots, the majority of which was done by Bekmambetov's company Bazelevs Production. The first effects supervisor, Jon Farhat, was forced {{to withdraw from the}} production due to illness and was replaced by Stefen Fangmeier, who accepted the task as Wanted would only require four months of work. Once Fangmeier visited Bazelevs in Moscow, the effects were behind schedule, with only 12 finished composites out of the planned 500. Fangemier then brought two other supervisors to assist him in finishing many shots per week, so the job could <b>get</b> <b>done</b> by the deadline, a process the supervisor described as [...] "a creative challenge on one hand, but on the other also a significant production challenge." [...] Another major contributor was London-based Framestore, responsible for the climactic train crash.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, {{the state}} added {{most of the}} {{district}} to Troy's Empire Zone. This economic development incentive gives businesses that locate in the included areas tax credits and exemptions {{to encourage them to}} locate there. The state has also moved some of its employees into the district, through the interventions of former State Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno, a resident of nearby Brunswick, who represented the district that included the city. He steered state grants towards the rehabilitation of the buildings that now house state government offices, as well as school aid that helped the city keep its property taxes low. City officials say his help has been vital, and will be missed following his 2008 resignation.'People won't realize how important he was until years from now, when they find that things don't <b>get</b> <b>done</b> as quickly or as easily without him,' Mr. Tutunjian said.}} ...|$|E
500|$|Leckie {{had worked}} on albums such as George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Ringo Starr's Sentimental Journey, and was {{employed}} as a tape-operator on Meddle, partly for his proclivity for working into {{the early hours of}} the morning. [...] He has said that Pink Floyd's sessions would often begin in the afternoon, and end early the next morning, [...] "during which time nothing would <b>get</b> <b>done.</b> There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints." [...] The band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff. [...] They also spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between their next albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|The game {{deviates}} {{from the}} NHS model; Webley and Carr decided that players should {{think of the}} hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from Theme Park and borrowed {{a great deal of}} code. A program which made animation easier was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not <b>get</b> <b>done,</b> effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game. It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete. The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis's estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an [...] "alarming size".|$|E

500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would <b>get</b> <b>done.</b> We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{software}} {{quality management system}} (QMS) has been designed in a democratic fashion by programmers and has been approved by management. In order to motivate the programmers in following their own standards, measurement feedback is used for creating social pressure (peer pressure and management pressure). In {{nine out of ten}} cases this approach has been successful. Could the failure of the tenth case be an indication of the statement “what <b>gets</b> measured <b>gets</b> <b>done</b> ” not being as obviously true as it is sometimes assumed to be in management literature? Trying to investigate this by reflecting on seven years of conversations with programmers and managers, various explanations are presented. Few seem to have any validity. The most likely explanation seems to be that “what <b>gets</b> measured <b>gets</b> <b>done</b> ” is a statement about group behaviour. When it comes to individuals or very small groups, special predicaments may make behaviour less predictable. The theoretical insights for QMS design, provided by this case study, is that the “what <b>gets</b> measured <b>gets</b> <b>done</b> ” design approach might prove more efficient if one manages to conceptualize lumps of individuals as self-managing teams or groups...|$|R
2500|$|There {{were rumors}} {{leading up to}} the 2007 NFL Draft that the Raiders were eager to part ways with Randy Moss through a trade. First-year Raiders head coach Lane Kiffin {{went so far as to}} contact their {{division}} rival Denver Broncos to [...] "gauge interest", but the Patriots and Green Bay Packers were the two teams most interested in acquiring Moss. Packers QB Brett Favre, who once said, [...] "There is no one in this league who puts fear in people more than Randy Moss," [...] tried to persuade team management to trade for him, but a deal that both sides could agree to did not <b>get</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Throughout these wars King Sigismund {{tried to}} [...] and {{streamline}} the Commonwealth government. The electoral monarchy in Poland {{had created a}} nobility with extensive powers {{and a great deal}} of division. Sigismund worked to gain more power for the king as well as to allow government business to pass with a majority of votes of the parliament rather than unanimity, which was extremely hard to achieve and meant that things often did not <b>get</b> <b>done.</b> All these actions led to a rebellion, but the King was ultimately victorious and, despite what some historians like Paweł Jasienica often stated, his reign marked a period of Polish greatness.|$|E
