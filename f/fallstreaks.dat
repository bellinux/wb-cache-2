40|$|Raindrop images {{obtained}} on research flights of the NCAR Electra {{aircraft in the}} Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) are analyzed. The drop size distributions, based on the images obtained in 6 -s samples (about 750 m of flight track), are used to calculate both radar reflectivity Z and rain rate R. Airborne radar data from the NOAA P- 3 aircraft flying in coordination with the Electra are used to categorize the particle-image data according to whether the drop images were obtained in regions of convective or stratiform precipitation. Within stratiform precipitation, the same rain rate could be produced by a drop spectrum dominated by numerous small drops (lower reflectivity) or by a few large drops (higher reflectivity). The reflectivity values varied {{by as much as}} 9 dB for a given rain rate. Reflectivity data from the airborne radar and flight-level data reveal that the stratiform regions often contain <b>fallstreaks</b> of about 0. 1 – 2 km in horizontal dimension. The <b>fallstreaks</b> are associated with large-drop spectra and local maxima in reflectivity up to approximately 40 dBZ and in rain rates up to 25 mm h 21. The <b>fallstreaks</b> extend downward from the melting band and bend with the low-level wind shear, but do not usually reach the surface. Thus, although relatively more uniform than convective regions, stratiform regions can be variable in reflectivity and rain rate at fine spatial scales in both the horizonta...|$|E

40|$|This work is two pronged, {{discussing}} 1) the morphology of contrails {{and their}} transition to cirrus uncinus, and 2) their microphysical and radiative properties. It {{is based upon}} the fortuitous occurrence of an unusual set of essentially parallel contrails and the unanticipated availability of nearly simultaneous observations by photography, satellite, automated ground-based lidar, and a newly available database of aircraft flight tracks. The contrails, oriented from the northeast to southwest, are carried to the southeast with a com-ponent of the wind so that they are spread from the northwest to southeast. Convective turrets form along each contrail to form the cirrus uncinus with <b>fallstreaks</b> of ice crystals that are oriented essentially normal to the contrail length. Each contrail is observed sequentially by the lidar and tracked backward to the time and position of the originating aircraft track with the appropriate component of the wind. The correlation coefficient between predicted and actual time of arrival at the lidar is 0. 99, so that one may identify both visually and satellite-observed contrails exactly. Contrails generated earlier in the westernmost flight cor-ridor occasionally arrive simultaneously with those formed later closer to the lidar to produce broader cirrus <b>fallstreaks</b> and overlapping contrails on the satellite image. The minimum age of a contrail is 2 h and corresponds to the longest time of travel to the lidar. The lag between the initial formation of the contrai...|$|E

The incidence of liquid phase cloud with apparent ice-phase precipitation is investigated. Scenarios for mixed-phase particle nucleation, and fallstreak formation and sustenance are discussed.

50|$|A <b>fallstreak</b> hole (also {{known as}} a hole punch cloud, punch hole cloud, skypunch, cloud canal or cloud hole) is a large gap, usually {{circular}} or elliptical, that can appear in cirrocumulus or altocumulus clouds. Such holes are formed when the water temperature in the clouds is below freezing but the water, in a supercooled state, has not frozen yet {{due to the lack}} of ice nucleation. When ice crystals do form, a domino effect is set off due to the Bergeron process, causing the water droplets around the crystals to evaporate: this leaves a large, often circular, hole in the cloud.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the {{international}} ASTAR experiment (Arctic Study of Aerosols, Clouds and Radiation) carried out from Longyearbyen (Spitsbergen) from 10 May to 11 June 2004, the AWI (Alfred Wegener Institute) Polar 2 aircraft {{was equipped with}} a unique combination of remote and in situ instruments. The airborne AMALi lidar provided downward backscatter and Depolarisation ratio profiles at 532 nm wavelength. The in situ instrumental setup comprised a Polar Nephelometer, a Cloud Particle Imager (CPI) {{as well as a}} Nevzorov and standard PMS probes to measure cloud particle properties in terms of scattering characteristics, particle morphology and size, and in-cloud partitioning of ice/water content. The objective of the paper is to present the results of a case study related to observations with ice crystals precipitating down to supercooled boundary-layer stratocumulus. The flight pattern was predefined in a way that firstly the AMALi lidar probed the cloud tops to guide the in situ measurements into a particular cloud formation. Three kinds of clouds with different microphysical and optical properties have therefore been quasi-simultaneously observed: (i) water droplets stratiform-layer, (ii) drizzle-drops <b>fallstreak</b> and (iii) precipitating ice-crystals from a cirrus cloud above. The signatures of these clouds are clearly evidenced from the in situ measurements and from the lidar profiles in term of backscatter and Depolarisation ratio. Accordingly, typical lidar ratios, i. e., extinction-to-backscatter ratios, are derived from the measured scattering phase function combined with subsequent particle shapes and size distributions. The backscatter profiles can therefore be retrieved under favourable conditions of low optical density. From these profiles extinction values in different cloud types can be obtained and compared with the direct in situ measurements...|$|R
40|$|During {{the case}} study from the First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program) Regional Experiment (FIRE) Intensive Field Observation (IFO), one {{airborne}} lidar system and four ground-based systems collected linear depolarization, intrinsically calibrated backscatter, and Doppler velocity information. Data presented describe the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of cirrus clouds over an area encompassing southern and central Wisconsin. Cirrus cloud types include dissipating subvisual and thin fibrous cirrus cloud bands, an isolated mesoscale uncinus complex, a large-scale, deep cloud that developed into an organized cirrus structure within the lidar array, {{and a series of}} intensifying mesoscale cirrus cloud masses. It is noted that the cirrus frequently developed in the vertical from particle <b>fallstreaks</b> emanating from generating regions at or near cloud tops; however, glaciating supercooled altocumulus clouds contributed to the production of ice mass {{at the base of the}} deep cirrus cloud...|$|E
40|$|International audienceKnowledge on the {{occurrence}} of multiple cloud layers, the heights of their boundaries, their internal structure and phase is important for an accurate determination of radiative fluxes through the atmosphere. Multi-layer mixed phase clouds have simultaneously been profiled with a ground-based 95 -GHz radar and Ne:YAG based airborne lidars. Due to their different attenuation and sensitivity to particle size and phase these instruments provide complementary information of cloud boundaries and cloud structure. Case studies from a field campaign over Southern UK are presented. In one case a narrow altostratus layer of mainly spherical, liquid particles was embedded in an ice cloud of larger vertical extent. The liquid layer was resolved in detail by the lidar but did not appear distinguishably in the radar profile, which was much {{more sensitive to the}} ice particles. <b>Fallstreaks</b> below the cloud base show a signature in the radar signals only. In another case the lidar beam was blocked in the upper part of a mid-level cloud layer with band like structure, while this cloud hardly appeared in the radar reflectivity which instead was dominated by another band 1 km below. Both instruments detected nearly the same cloud boundaries and structures when the liquid layer disappeared and an optically thin ice cloud remained. This study clearly reveals the tremendous information gain by a synergetic use of radar and lidar for cloud profiling...|$|E
40|$|Simulations of contrail-to-cirrus {{transition}} {{were performed}} with an LES model. In Part 1 {{the impact of}} relative humidity, temperature and vertical wind shear was explored in a detailed parametric study. Here, we study atmospheric parameters (like stratification and depth of the supersaturated layer) and processes which may affect the contrail evolution. Under suitable conditions (controlled by the radiation scenario and stratification) radiative heating lifts the contrail-cirrus and prolongs its lifetime. The radiation scenario affects the radiance incident on the contrail layer and is characterised herein by the season, time of day {{and the presence of}} lower-level cloudiness. The potential of contrail-driven secondary nucleation, both via heterogeneous nucleation of preactivated soot cores (from former contrail ice crystals) and homogeneous nucleation is investigated. It turned out that in our model the pure contrail dynamics (triggered by radiative heating) does not suffice to force homogeneous freezing of ambient liquid aerosol particles. Our model results suggest that heterogeneous nucleation of preactivated soot cores is unimportant mainly because the relative humidity does not exceed ice saturation substantially close to the contrail core. Contrail evolution is not controlled by the depth of the supersaturated layer as long as it exceeds roughly 500 m. Deep <b>fallstreaks</b> however need thicker layers. A variation of the initial ice crystal number is effective during the whole evolution of a contrail which implies that engine modifications that lead to lower soot emissions would lead to optically thinner and shorter living contrail-cirrus...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from {{a case study}} in which the macrophysical and microphysical characteristics of a warm-frontal mixed-phase cloud were investigated using simultaneous aircraft and polarimetric radar measurements. A region of embedded convection was located and sampled at various stages of its ascent through the cloud from 5 C to 11 C, and evidence is presented that it was triggered by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability near the melting layer. High concentrations of small crystals were observed in and above narrow convective turrets, around 1 km across, that contained supercooled liquid water droplets with an effective diameter of 24 m and riming ice particles. The area surrounding the turrets was found to contain pristine columns, and was strikingly visible to the radar as a broad plume of high differential reflectivity ZDR (around 3 dB), contrasting with the 0 – 0. 5 dB range usually found in ice clouds. The columns observed in situ had axial ratios of around 5 : 1, in close agreement with the values predicted theoretically from ZDR assuming horizontal alignment of the crystals. We argue that the high concentrations of small ice crystals (up to 103 l 1) observed in this case were splinters produced via the Hallett-Mossop mechanism in the riming process, and these then grew rapidly by deposition in the water-saturated environment into pristine columns. Later in the ascent the picture was complicated by the presence of a <b>fallstreak</b> containing large, low-ZDR aggregates which appeared to rapidly accrete the columns. A number of plumes of high ZDR were observed by the radar on the same day, each of which persisted for at leas...|$|R
40|$|During the {{intensive}} International Cirrus Experiment (ICE) conducted over North Sea during the Fall of 1989, natural cirrus and contrail-induced cirrus have been analysed from in situ and remote sensing measurements (lidar and infrared radiometer). These two clouds primarily formed in a same range of altitude (8200 m/- 37 C). Analysis of the measurements depicts distinctive microphysical and optical {{properties in the}} two kinds of cirrus. Natural cirrus exhibits sheared <b>fallstreaks</b> of ice crystals up to 750 #mu#m size near the base level. From the top {{to the base of}} this cloud the mean values of ice water content and particle concentration increase from 15 to 50 mg/m" 3 and from 26 to 60 l"-" 1 respectively. The corresponding visible optical depth is around 2. 0. Greatest particle concentration and smallest ice crystals are measured at all levels in contrails leading to an optical depth of 0. 8 in the denser cloud despite an ice water content which never exceeds 18 mg/m" 3. These results are consistent with remote measurements from which the backscattering to extinction ratio k is deduced. The largest values of k (0. 047 sr"-" 1) are found in a young-life contrail and can be theoretically explained by a spherical shape of small ice crystals. Non-spherical ice particles with larger mean diameter are found in natural cirrus and lead to lower values of k (around 0. 02 sr"-" 1). (orig.) 38 refs.
