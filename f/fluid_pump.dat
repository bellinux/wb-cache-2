5000|$|Toyota is {{offering}} a new Continuously Variable Transmission on the LE, LE Eco and S trims, which they claim is more smooth, and improves fuel efficiency, named the CVTi-S (Continuously Variable Transmission intelligent-shift).

Its forward gear ratio range is from 0.396 to 2.480 {{and it has a}} 4.761 final drive ratio. A transmission fluid warmer was added, reducing warm-up time, and lower viscosity CVT fluid improves efficiency. Its new <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> reduces parasitic loss at high speeds. The transmission's software creates discrete sequential shift points to emulate traditional transmissions while accelerating. The S trim offers a manual-mode shift gate in the console shifter, or paddle shifters on the steering wheel allowing sequential [...] "shifts" [...] through 7 speeds, addressing complaints that earlier pulley-type CVTs had a [...] "rubber band" [...] feel when accelerating because of the lag as the transmission entered its power band.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{the smaller}} T 211 turbo-transmission was {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to hydro-mechanical bus transmissions, being designed for diesel railcars in the low power range of [...] Similar to the first turbo-transmission, the T 211 used a linked converter-coupling combination but it also had a high-speed gear for greater efficiency. Additionally, a reversing gear assembly was added and an optional hydrodynamic retarder could be installed if required. The converter had a hydrodynamic circuit diameter of 346 mm, while the fluid coupling had a slightly smaller diameter of 305 mm. And due to its high-speed gear, the main shaft could run significantly higher at 4,170 rpm. As a result, the T 211 r had reserve power, which was reflected by its reinforced mechanical components (gears, bearings and shafts) as well as the transmission controls. At the same time however, the diameters of the converter, coupling and retarder remained unchanged. The overall flow rate within the hydrodynamic circuits was increased to accommodate the higher power rating of [...] At , the main shaft ran at just under 5,000 rpm which resulted in rotational speeds for the (empty) converter of 74 m/s when the vehicle reached its maximum speed. To ensure adequate cooling of the converter during high-speed operations, a stronger hydrodynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> was installed, which supplied 3.5 l/s of oil through the heat exchanger during the travel phase and 9.0 l/s when in the braking phase, with the retarder rotor also serving as an additional circulating pump. When viewed from the outside this T 211 r transmission differed from its predecessor, the T 211 re.3 with , only slightly through the addition of a built-in electronic control unit and an enlarged air filter.|$|E
