5|$|The {{similarities}} of yttrium to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and <b>erbium.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with <b>erbium</b> and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E

It produced more medical isotopes while allowing higher fidelity of materials research than any other reactor available in the U.S. Energy Department's science and energy laboratory system during the 1970s.

25|$|In 1991, a Bell Labs {{research}} team transmitted solitons error-free at 2.5 gigabits {{over more than}} 14,000 kilometres, using <b>erbium</b> optical fibre amplifiers (spliced-in segments of optical fibre containing the rare earth element <b>erbium).</b> Pump lasers, coupled to the optical amplifiers, activate the <b>erbium,</b> which energizes the light pulses.|$|E
25|$|When the photons {{belonging}} to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited <b>erbium</b> atoms, the <b>erbium</b> atoms give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state.|$|E
25|$|This high-powered {{light beam}} excites the <b>erbium</b> ions to their higher-energy state.|$|E
25|$|The mixed {{light is}} guided into {{a section of}} fiber with <b>erbium</b> ions {{included}} in the core.|$|E
25|$|So in 1842 {{the number}} of known rare-earth {{elements}} had reached six: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, <b>erbium</b> and terbium.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, <b>erbium,</b> thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the <b>erbium</b> group (dysprosium, holmium, <b>erbium,</b> and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. Gadolinium becomes ferromagnetic at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – terbium, dysprosium, holmium, <b>erbium,</b> thulium, and ytterbium – become ferromagnetic at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to {{separate}} the crude yttria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts <b>erbium,</b> and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.|$|E
25|$|Holmium oxide {{has some}} fairly {{dramatic}} color changes {{depending on the}} lighting conditions. In daylight, it is a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is a fiery orange red, almost indistinguishable from the way <b>erbium</b> oxide looks under this same lighting. This {{is related to the}} sharp emission bands of the phosphors. Holmium oxide has a wide band gap of 5.3 eV and thus should appear colorless. The yellow color originates from abundant lattice defects (such as oxygen vacancies) and is related to internal transitions at the Ho3+ ions.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} doped with certain rare-earth {{elements}} such as <b>erbium</b> {{can be used as}} the gain medium of a laser or optical amplifier. Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal amplification by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is optically pumped with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|Discoverers of some {{elements}} named them after {{their home country}} or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium {{were based on the}} Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, terbium, <b>erbium,</b> ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium.|$|E
25|$|Holmium(III) oxide, or holmium oxide is a {{chemical}} compound of a rare-earth element holmium and oxygen with the formula Ho2O3. Together with dysprosium(III) oxide (Dy2O3) holmium oxide {{is one of}} the most powerfully paramagnetic substances known. The oxide, also called holmia, occurs as a component of the related <b>erbium</b> oxide mineral called erbia. Typically the oxides of the trivalent lanthanides coexist in nature and separation of these components requires specialized methods. Holmium oxide is used in making specialty colored glasses. Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions have a series of sharp optical absorption peaks in the visible spectral range. They are therefore traditionally used as a convenient calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the main}} section, each segment is {{equipped}} with twenty optical communications repeaters. These run off direct current fed from Breivika, with the seawater and seabed used for return current. Power is provided through a single-end feed; although supplying from both ends is safer, a single feed was regarded as sufficient. The cables are fed 1.1 ampere at 2,500 volt, fed from two redundant converters. Each repeater has eight <b>erbium</b> doped fiber amplifier pairs. The pairs operate independent of each other, including having their own power supply, allowing for redundancy should one fall out. The repeaters have an estimated lifetime of twenty-five years. The cables are equipped with an ocean ground protection panel to provide isolation and thus hinder damage from lightning.|$|E
25|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals multiplexed {{within the}} 1550nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of <b>erbium</b> doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550nm band.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander {{found that}} samples of yttria {{contained}} three oxides: white yttrium oxide (yttria), yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored <b>erbium</b> oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements were later isolated {{from each of}} those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and <b>erbium).</b> In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in [...] "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria {{was found to be}} a mineral and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.|$|E
500|$|In 1878, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac {{separated}} from the rare earth [...] "erbia" [...] another independent component, which he called [...] "ytterbia", for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of <b>erbium.</b> He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called [...] "ytterbium" [...] (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, terbium and <b>erbium).</b> In 1907, the new earth [...] "lutecia" [...] was {{separated from}} ytterbia, from which the element [...] "lutecium" [...] (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name [...] "ytterbium" [...] was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma ray source.|$|E
500|$|Ytterbium was {{discovered}} by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878. While examining samples of gadolinite, Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia, and he named it ytterbia, for Ytterby, the Swedish village near where he found the new component of <b>erbium.</b> Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called [...] "ytterbium".|$|E

The single crystals of doped YAG are normally produced by the Czochralski process.|$|E
500|$|Thulium was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had enough of it to purify {{sufficiently}} to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as <b>erbium</b> was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|In 1878, <b>erbium</b> ores {{were found}} to contain the oxides of holmium and thulium. French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, while working with holmium oxide, {{separated}} dysprosium oxide from it in Paris in 1886. His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. On succeeding, he named the element dysprosium from the Greek dysprositos (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning [...] "hard to get". The element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by Frank Spedding at Iowa State University in the early 1950s.|$|E
500|$|... 1969 {{studies on}} the element showed that {{lawrencium}} reacted with chlorine to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl3. Its volatility {{was found to be}} {{similar to that of the}} chlorides of curium, fermium, and nobelium and much less than that of rutherfordium chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500atoms of the isotope 256Lr, comparing it with divalent (No, Ba, Ra), trivalent (Fm, Cf, Cm, Am, Ac), and tetravalent (Th, Pu) elements. It was found that lawrencium coextracted with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the 256Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of Md3+ in the elution sequence. Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr3+ ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) fluoride (LrF3) and hydroxide (Lr(OH)3) should both be insoluble in water. Due to the actinide contraction, the ionic radius of Lr3+ should be smaller than that of Md3+, and it should elute ahead of Md3+ when ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate (ammonium α-HIB) is used as an eluant. Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope 260Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as <b>erbium,</b> and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was (88.6±0.3)pm, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends. Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to (88.1±0.1)pm and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of −(3685±13)kJ·mol−1. It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.|$|E

2500|$|Doped fiber {{amplifiers}} (DFAs) are optical amplifiers {{that use}} a doped optical fiber as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They {{are related to}} fiber lasers.

The most common example is the <b>Erbium</b> Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where {{the core of a}} silica fiber is doped with trivalent <b>erbium</b> ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at a wavelength of 980 nm or 1,480nm, and exhibits gain in the 1,550nm region.|$|E

2500|$|In 1842 Mosander also {{separated}} the yttria into three oxides: pure yttria, terbia and erbia (all {{the names are}} derived from the town name [...] "Ytterby"). The earth giving pink salts he called terbium; the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called <b>erbium.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{point is that}} the <b>erbium</b> gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual - when an atom “lases” it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser. [...] The <b>erbium</b> doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|Holmium (Holmia, Latin {{name for}} Stockholm) was {{discovered}} by Marc Delafontaine and Jacques-Louis Soret in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic absorption bands of the then-unknown element (they called it [...] "Element X"). Later in 1878, Per Teodor Cleve independently discovered the element while {{he was working on}} erbia earth (<b>erbium</b> oxide).|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} C- and L-band amplifiers {{is that a}} longer length of doped fiber is used in L-band amplifiers. [...] The longer length of fiber allows a lower inversion level to be used, thereby giving at longer wavelengths (due to the band-structure of <b>Erbium</b> in silica) while still providing a useful amount of gain.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the term}} [...] "coarse {{wavelength}} division multiplexing" [...] was fairly generic, and meant {{a number of}} different things. In general, these things shared the fact that the choice of channel spacings and frequency stability was such that <b>erbium</b> doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) could not be utilized. Prior to the relatively recent ITU standardization of the term, one common meaning for coarse WDM meant two (or possibly more) signals multiplexed onto a single fiber, where one signal was in the 1550nm band, and the other in the 1310nm band.|$|E

[...] At the estimated energy levels, the D-D fusion reaction may occur, producing helium-3 and a 2.45MeV neutron.
