5|$|In June 1966, the now-purged {{parliament}} passed 24 resolutions {{including the}} banning of Marxism-Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining {{support for the president}} amongst elements of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> {{and since then}} has always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E

5|$|On 13 November 2012, {{during the}} ongoing Syrian Civil War {{that began in}} March 2011, President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree to {{establish}} a branch of the University of Damascus in Quneitra. On 6 June 2013, the nearby Quneitra border crossing was attacked by Opposition forces and temporarily occupied, with Syrian army later retaking the crossing; In July 2013, opposition forces attacked a military checkpoint in Quneitra, and by the next day were attacking several Syrian Arab Army positions in Quneitra. Syrian opposition forces again captured the crossing in August 2014. A Filipino peacekeeper of the UNDOF was wounded during the fighting. As a result the Austrian government announced the withdrawal of its troops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|In the conflict's {{early months}} it {{appeared}} that Gaddafi's government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious. Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training. NATO {{announced that it would}} enforce the no-fly zone. On 30 April a NATO air strike killed Gaddafi's sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{became a}} Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its {{independence}} on 26 June 1960.

Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
