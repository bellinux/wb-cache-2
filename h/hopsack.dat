Full-length, the legs flare slightly to hems. Jeans-style pockets, two welt pockets on front and two patch pockets on back. Waistband has beltloops spaced throughout. Zipper fly at front with three buttons to secure waistband. The pants have an all-over embroidery in vertical and horizontal bands of stylized leaves, triangles, and other shapes in gold, white, green, yellow, and magenta.

50|$|In the 1940s, Ballerino became {{well-known}} as {{a member}} of the California Design sportswear movement. Following in the footsteps of Claire McCardell, Ballerino drew inspiration from African, Latin American, Pacific, and Caribbean native styles, and helped popularize ethnic garments such as the <b>hopsack</b> dress, midriff top, pollera, and dirndl in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Barathea, {{sometimes}} spelled barrathea, is a soft fabric, with a <b>hopsack</b> {{twill weave}} giving a surface that is lightly pebbled or ribbed. The yarns use cover various combinations of wool, silk and cotton. Worsted barathea (made {{with a smooth}} wool yarn) is often used for evening coats, such as dress coats, dinner jackets, and military uniforms, in black and midnight blue. Silk barathea, either all silk, or using cotton weft and silken warp, is widely used in the necktie industry.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a fabric with moisture management function. Said fabric has the structure {{similar to that}} of plant; its structure is composed of the following three layers of base layer, intermediate layer and top layer. Its base layer is similar to stem of the plant, has gauze structure which is several fabric units formed by twisting multiple ply yarn together and is contacted with skin of human body; the intermediate layer is similar to branches of the plant, for example, the yarn of the described fabric unit can be primarily separated in said intermediate layer and formed into <b>hopsack</b> structure, huck structure or honeycomb structure; and top layer is similar to leaves of plant, for example, the yarn of the described fabric unit can be further separated in said top layer and formed into plain structure. Under the action of capillary of fabric yarn the moisture can be transferred to intermediate layer from base layer, and diffused out from said top layer. 一种具有水分管理功能的织物，该织物具有类似植物的构造，并由如下三层构成：底层，其与植物的茎类似，如所述的纱罗结构，其为多股纱线拧在一起形成多个织物单元；所述底层与人体的皮肤接触；中间层，其与植物的枝权类似，比如所述织物单元的纱线在该中间层初步分离，形成方平织物结构、浮松结构或蜂巢结构；顶层，其与植物的叶子类似，比如所述织物单元的纱线在该顶层进一步分离，形成平织结构；如此构成的织物，可在织物纱线的毛细作用下，将水分从底层输送到中间层，然后从该顶层散出，从而具有良好的水分管理特性。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 司徒誉祥, Situ YuxiangTitle in Traditional Chinese: 一種具有水分管理功能的織物Chin...|$|E
40|$|The Institute of Textiles & Clothing of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has {{developed}} a technique to produce Nu-Torque singles ring yarns for weaving in a single step on a modified ring spinning frame. The surface appearance of denim fabric and fabric dimensional stability after laundering is improved by the application of Nu-Torque singles ring yarns on woven fabrics. Yarn structure can be improved and yarn residual torque can be reduced significantly with an attachment installed on the conventional ring spinning frame. During an experiment, a fabric sample was produced by using the Nu-Torque yarns as weft yarns, to evaluate the effects of weft yarn torque on the 'small snake' pattern of denim fabrics. Two conventional fabrics with normal and low twist level yarns were also woven for comparison of fabric properties and appearance. The effects of yarn torque on dimensional stability of fabrics in plain, <b>hopsack,</b> and satin weave structures were also studied. The {{results show that the}} evenness of Nu-Torque yarn {{is similar to that of}} conventional yarns, while yarn hairiness of Nu-Torque yarns is less than that of conventional yarns.

40|$|Composites {{composed}} of polylactide (PLA), woven flax fiber textiles (weave style of 2 2 twill and 4 4 <b>hopsack)</b> and boehmite alumina were produced by hot press. The spraying technique served for the pre-dispersion of the alumina nanoparticles. The aqueous alumina slurry {{was produced by}} mixing the water with water dispersible alumina. The dispersion of the flax structures and alumina particles in the composites was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The polylactide composites were subjected to water absorption and instrumented falling weight impact tests. The creep and thermomechanical properties of the composites were determined in short-time creep tests (performed at various temperatures), thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis, respectively. It {{was found that the}} incorporation of alumina particles reduced the water uptake compared to the polylactide/flax blends. The impact energy and stiffness value of polylactide/flax blends was markedly higher than that of PLA but reflected the effects of composite structures. Incorporation of alumina particles enhanced storage modulus and the creep resistance compared to the polylactide/flax blends but slightly incremented thermal resistance at high temperature. No clear trend in the flax weave style-effect was found in the thermal behavior. The creep master curves were constructed by applying the time–temperature superposition principle. The Findley power law could satisfactorily describe the creep compliance versus time traces for all systems studied...|$|E
