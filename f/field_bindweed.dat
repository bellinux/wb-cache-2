5000|$|Convolvulus arvensis (<b>field</b> <b>{{bindweed}})</b> is {{a species}} of bindweed in the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae), native to Europe and Asia. It is a climbing or creeping herbaceous perennial plant growing to 0.5-2 m high. There are two varieties: ...|$|E
5000|$|This species {{presents}} two overlapping generations a year, {{the second}} generation is generally missing in cool years. The moth flies from May to August depending on the location and then again from August to early September. The pupa overwinters. The larvae feed on <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis) [...] and Polygonum species.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Control and Management== <b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> is {{difficult}} to eradicate because the seeds remain viable in soil for up to 20 years. One plant can produce up to 500 seeds. The deep, extensive root system stores carbohydrates and proteins and allows it to sprout repeatedly from fragments and rhizomes following removal of aboveground growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> intertwines and topples native species. It {{competes with}} other species for sunlight, {{moisture}} and nutrients. It poses threats to restoration efforts and riparian corridors by choking out grasses and forbs. It can decrease habitat biodiversity. It {{is one of}} the most serious weeds of agricultural fields in temperate regions of the world.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are polyphagous, {{feeding on}} various {{herbaceous}} plants, mainly on mallow (Malva species), common marshmallow (Althaea officinalis), <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis), goosefoots (Chenopodium) and dandelion (Taraxacum). Adults {{are on the}} wing on sunny days in May and August in two generations. They are attracted to light. This species overwinters as pupa below ground. Rarely it is a migrant species.|$|E
50|$|Aceria is a genus of mites {{belonging}} to the family Eriophyidae, the gall mites. These tiny animals are parasites of plants. Several species can cause blistering and galls, including erineum galls. A few are economically significant pests, while others are useful as agents of biological pest control of invasive plants such as rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea), creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense), and <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis).|$|E
50|$|Convolvulus, 1931 (situated in Helsinki, Kaisaniemi park), which {{depicts a}} young woman. Convolvulus stands for lesser {{bindweed}} or <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> In this masterpiece the woman raises {{her hand in}} a half-protecting, half-blessing gesture. This sculpture is often said to symbolize spring's arrival to the north. The sculpture was born {{as a result of}} a competition organised by Helsinki City in 1930-31 to decorate Helsinki with public works of art. It is made out of bronze and is 240 cm high. Another version of Convolvulus is 120 cm high and stands on the grave of Bertel Hintze in the old part of Hietaniemi cemetery.|$|E
50|$|This mite is {{native to}} central and {{southern}} Europe and northern Africa. It was imported from Greece and released in the US state of Texas in 1989. It is now established in Texas and surrounding states, {{where it has been}} known to reduce the density of invasive <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> The adult mite is nearly microscopic and looks like a minute yellow maggot with two pairs of legs. The nymph is similar in appearance to the adult. The adult and the nymph both damage the plant, feeding on the leaves during the warmer seasons when the plant is growing, and on stem and root buds when the plant is dormant over the winter. Galls form on damaged plant tissues, causing leaves to warp and curl and stems and roots to grow out stunted if at all.|$|E
50|$|This moth is {{native to}} much of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The adult moth is about eleven {{millimeters}} long and dark brown with one large white spot on each of its four wings. Two adult generations emerge each year, one in late spring and one in summer. In warm areas {{there is often a}} third generation. The female lays about 400 to 500 eggs. The larva is a brown caterpillar. The larva is the destructive stage. It eats leaves and flowers, especially new buds. This is the desired effect of this moth when it is used as an agent of biological pest control against <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis). It was first introduced into the United States in the 1980s to attack this agricultural weed, which is its main foodplant.|$|E
50|$|This species faces {{a number}} of threats. Most all of the populations are on land that has been heavily grazed by {{domestic}} cattle and sheep, and trampling and predation by the animals can adversely affect the plant. Grazing still occurs {{in some parts of}} the plant's range, and it generally grows in steeper spots that have been less impacted by grazing. The area is also browsed by bighorn sheep, elk, deer, and mountain goats. The ecosystem is negatively impacted by introduced species of plants, including cheat grass (Bromus tectorum), St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis), Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria genistifolia ssp. dalmatica), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). The three-toed stem-boring weevil (Mecinus janthinus) has been released into four o'clock habitat that is infested with dalmatian toadflax to act as an agent of biological pest control against the weed. While the four o'clock generally survives wildfire due to its large underground rhizome, fires increase the number of non-native plants growing in the area. Insecticides may damage populations of important pollinating insects. Off-road vehicles and trampling by hikers may damage plants. Herbicide spraying has damaged populations. Insects have been noted to feed on the plant, including spittlebugs (Aprophora and Philaenus sp.) and the small moth Lithariapteryx abroniaeella.|$|E

30|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> has {{a natural}} {{resistance}} to chemical herbicides; therefore, conventional herbicides are generally ineffective for its control (Westwood and Weller 1997). Since 1979, plant pathogens {{have been used}} as weed management because they were relatively safe and did not result in herbicide resistance (Charudattan and Walker 1982; Aneja et al. 2013). <b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> could be naturally infected by Alternaria triticina and Phomopsis longicolla (Saleem et al. 2015; Li et al. 2010). During the summer of 2015, naturally diseased leaves of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> were collected in Shihezi City.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis L.) is a noxious {{perennial}} weed of many fallow and cropland fields {{all over the}} world. Present control methods are not satisfactory for <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> Metsulfuron, 2 [[[[(4 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2 -yl) amino] carbonyl] amino] sulfonyl] benzoic acid, is a new herbicide that {{has been shown to}} have activity on bindweed especially when tank mixed with other herbicides. This study was conducted to investigate the field performance and some physiological effects of metsulfuron on <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> Neither metsulfuron alone nor metsulfuron combinations gave persistent control of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> Metsulfuron usually increased the activity of other bindweed herbicides. Herbicide application to <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> in the full bloom growth stage did not control the weed as well as the same treatments in the prebloom growth stages and treating regrowth the fall after tilling bindweed in full blossom. Application of metsulfuron at full bloom decreased seed weight, seed size seed viability and seedling vigor of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> but did not alter seed set. Metsulfuron at 23 g/ha and above caused unacceptable injury to barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.). Higher rates of metsulfuron resulted in greater phytotoxicity. Metsulfuron stopped photosynthesis of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> within two weeks regardless of herbicide dosage used. <b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> seedlings were observed growing in the field under light intensities of 28 to 62 μmoles m- 2 s- 1 which was below the light compensation point obtained for greenhouse grown bindweed plants (about 65 μmoles m- 2 s- 1). Higher quantities of 14 C labelled metsulfuron per mg plant dry weight were recovered in the above treated leaf sections than in any other parts of bindweed plants. Metsulfuron applied as a foliage spray two days prior to administering 14 C metsulfuron significantly increased absorption to the radiolabelled herbicide in <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> plants...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> and powdery mildew on growth and yield of a pepper crop.

The greatest dry weight and yield of pepper were recorded with weed-free control treatment. Moreover, powdery mildew was severe. The fungicide application programs positively influenced growth and yield of pepper. The control plots had the lowest yield of pepper. The first symptoms of powdery mildew on pepper plants developed 20 - 25 days after powdery mildew diagnosis on <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> Two azoxystrobin applications, at 10 and 25 days after infection of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> by powdery mildew, restricted the disease progress.

30|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> is {{a global}} {{malignant}} perennial weed (Vasilakoglou et al. 2013), which competes with many crops, including corn, wheat, beans, cotton, and vegetables, for water, inorganic salt, nutrients, and light (Rodríguez-Navarro et al. 2011; Vasilakoglou et al. 2013). The qualities and yields of the crops declined in areas where <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> occurred (Lindenmayer et al. 2013). <b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> {{has become one of}} the most serious weed problems in Xinjiang, majorly affecting the growth of cotton and lacking effective methods to control it currently (Ma et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious weeds in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), but {{selective}} herbicides controlling this weed have not been reported. A field experiment was conducted in 2010 and repeated in 2011 in Greece to study the efficacy of herbicides flumioxazin and sulfosulfuron, applied pre- or post-emergence, on <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), as well as their phytotoxicity on potato. Gas chromatography-mass spectrography (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were conducted for possible herbicide residues in potato tubers. Also, the efficacy of these herbicides on <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> generated from root fragments was investigated in greenhouse pot experiments. In pots, both herbicides provided 78 % to 100 % control of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> generated from root fragments. In field, both herbicides when applied pre-emergence at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1 provided 65 % to 100 % <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> control. However, the corresponding post-emergence applications did not provide satisfactory weed control. All treatments provided excellent control of redroot pigweed. Potato growth was not significantly affected by herbicide application in 2010. However, in 2011, post-emergence applications of flumioxazin caused significant crop injury and yield reduction. The results of this study indicate that satisfactory control of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> and redroot pigweed, as well as high potato yield can be obtained by the pre-emergence application of flumioxazin or sulfosulfuron at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1, without herbicide residues on potato tubers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed,</b> {{also known}} as small-flowered morning glory, European morning glory, Creeping Charlie, Russian Creeper, and Creeping Jennie, is {{becoming}} each year a greater menace to farm lands.

It is therefore important that land-owners learn to identify bindweed and guard against its introduction on their farms. Where it has become established, steps should be taken at once for its eradication.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis) is a noxious weed of {{agricultural}} crops. The {{objective of the}} research was to study allelopathic effect of above ground mass of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> on maize using Petri dish bioassay. Water extracts from stem and leaf dry plant powder in three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 g/l) were tested on germination, seedling length and fresh biomass of two maize hybrids (Bc 574 and OSSK 596) in experiment set out as completely randomized design. Reduction of seed germination amounted up to 36 %. Stem extract showed higher inhibition effect on germination and shoot length, while both stem and leaf equally inhibited root length and fresh weight of maize seedling. With the increase of concentration, germination and growth parameters of maize decreased. Lowest concentrations of both stem and leaf extract showed stimulatory effect on shoot length of maize for 19. 2 and 26. 9 %. Maize hybrids differed in their susceptibility to water extracts.

40|$|Abstract <b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> is an {{important}} perinial weed of agricultural crops word-wide. There are plant pathogen fungus which could cause necrotic spots on the leaves and stems of convolvulus arvensis under natural coditions. In order to evaluate the effects of weed growth stage and length of dew period on disease development causes by Aletrnaria alternata and Fusarium sp. two expriments were performed in the greenhouse based on a completely randomized design in factorial arrangement with four replications during 2006 - 2007. Spore concentration for both experiments was 107 spores per ml of distilled water. In the first experiment, treatments were different growth stages of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (cotyledon, 4 -leaf, 6 -leaf, 9 - 11 -leaf stages). Results showed that disease development in the fungus of A. alternata was higher than Fusarium sp. The most susceptable growth stage of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> plants to A. alternata was 2 - 4 -leave stage. The second expriment was performed in order to study the effect of dew period length (6, 12, 24 and 48 hour dew periods) on disease development at 4 -leaf growth stage of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed.</b> The maximum disease development and minimum weed dry weight were observed with application of the fungus of A. alternata at dew periods of 24 and 48 hour, however, plant damage was also observed with a length of 6 hours dew period...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{research}} results, the isolate causing diseased leaves in <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> was A. niger.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis) is a {{herbaceous}} {{perennial weed}} which {{is difficult to}} control. Previous studies have noted that high rates of Roundup or Picloram provided the best control when evaluated one year after application. Generally, other workers have found that 3. 0 lbs/a or higher rates were needed for reductions in <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> to persist into the second year. However, these {{studies have been done}} in the Midwest, where crops are grown without irrigation, and thus the results may not be applicable to California conditions. Other work has found that Fall applications provided the most consistent <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> control. Since the top portion of the plant dies back to ground level each Fall, energy from the top portion of the plant moves into the roots for storage during this time. Previous work has also noted that water stress reduces control, and thus applications should not be made when plants are stressed for water. Touchdown is scheduled to be registered in California in 1999. This study was performed to compare Touchdown and Roundup Ultra in terms of <b>field</b> <b>bindweed</b> control. Touchdown and Roundup Ultra were each applied at three rates (2 lb/a*, 3 lb/a, and 4 lb/a) in addition to each herbicide at the 2 lb/a rate plus Banvel at 0. 25 lb/a.
