25|$|Federal {{funds are}} the reserve {{balances}} (also called Federal Reserve Deposits) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank {{is to have}} a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds {{plays an important role in}} the Federal Reserve System as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> inspired the name of the system and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Korean women {{keep their}} family names after their marriage, but their {{children}} take the father's surname. In the premodern, patriarchal Korean society, people were extremely conscious of familial values {{and their own}} family identities.

25|$|Whether Bagno's {{points are}} valid {{or not is}} open to debate, {{especially}} the solutions he recommends for the problems {{he claims to have}} identified. Whereas some agree that he has captured the feelings of the Brazilians towards Brazil's linguistic situation well, his book (Linguistic Prejudice: What <b>it</b> <b>Is,</b> <b>What</b> To Do) has been heavily criticized by some linguists and grammarians, due to his unorthodox claims, sometimes asserted to be biased or unproven.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it.

The BNP know the present system is their only chance of election. This is another example of the increasingly Goebbels-like campaign from the anti-AV people, for whom no lie is too idiotic given the truth is so unpalatable to them. AV makes lazy MPs work harder and reach out beyond their tribe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Britain needs to clean up politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{law clerk}} Mr. Guppy, enamoured of Esther, hopes {{to win her}} affection by helping her {{discover}} the identity of her parents. He finds connections to both Lady Dedlock and the deceased Nemo, who {{has been identified as}} Captain James Hawdon, and is eventually alerted to the existence of letters left behind by Hawdon but kept by his drunken landlord, Krook. Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but is terribly scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is sure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> she wants. While amassing other enemies, Tulkinghorn deduces Lady Dedlock's secret and tries to use it to keep her in line.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{postage stamp}} itself {{was born of}} utility (in England, 1840), as {{something}} simple {{and easy to use}} was needed to confirm that postage had been paid for an item of mail. People could purchase several stamps at one time and no longer had to make a special trip to pay for postage each time an item was mailed. The postage stamp design was usually printed from a fine engraving and were almost impossible to forge adequately. This is where the appearance of presidents on stamps was introduced. Moreover, the subject theme of a president, along with the honors associated with <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> began to define the stamp issues in ways that took it beyond the physical postage stamp itself and is why people began to collect them. There exist entire series of stamp issues whose printing was inspired by the subject alone.|$|E

25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> always exists.|$|E

Also noting that she had [...] "a profound sense of privacy", he added that she disliked attempts at flattery.|$|E
500|$|American speed skater Dan Jansen's {{personal}} tragedy {{was one of}} the more poignant events of the Games as he skated the 500metre race mere hours after his sister Jane died of leukemia. A gold medal favourite, Jansen chose to compete as he felt <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> his sister would have wanted. Viewers around the world witnessed his heartbreak as he fell and crashed into the outer wall {{in the first quarter of}} his heat. In the 1000metre race four days later, Jansen was on a world record pace when he again fell. [...] After failing again in Albertville, Jansen finally won a gold medal at the 1994 Lillehamer Games.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that DayZ provides some insight into people's motivations and behaviors when reacting to real crisis events, mirroring controlled experiments of a similar nature. However, some critics of this theory argue that participants do not react as they would in a real world situation in which their life is truly threatened. Despite the game being biased towards self-interested, hostile competition, many players enter the game with their own perceptions and priorities. These varied approaches and experiences within the game suggest that even {{in a system that}} should theoretically promote rational behaviour, people act in unexpected ways. It {{has been proposed}} that this dispels the idea that chaos is an objective and defining feature of the system, rather <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> players make of it.|$|E

Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects.

500|$|Manga Sanctuary {{praised the}} protagonist for being {{original}} and unique.

However, Manga News said that this impassivity is good because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> differentiates Neuro from Case Closed. Its design, setting, the [...] "interesting and well-constructed characters", and the development of the relationship between Neuro and Yako were also praised. The reviewer said the series is [...] "completely apart in the world of manga, Neuro is a genre unto itself which is between several styles and therefore appeal to a wider audience." [...] Animelands critic also compared it to Case Closed, but said its black humor, cruel and deadpan laughs were [...] "quite caustic." ...|$|E
