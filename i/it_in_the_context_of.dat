5|$|John {{consolidated}} his conquests and {{the existing}} Byzantine holdings in Asia by {{the building of}} a series of forts. Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole; he points out that while John's father Alexios had fortified places on the coast, John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion, Achyraous and Laodicea, which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor. This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin a recovery that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

Because {{there is a}} growing number of <b>IT</b> megaprojects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> of public private partnerships, recent work concentrates on the explanation of the relationship between public and private partners and the success factors for these relations. However, we still have a lack of understanding on the causes and consequences for <b>IT</b> megaproject failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> of public private partnerships. In this exploratory, qualitative single-case study from the German TollCollect IT megaproject we draw on findings from the psychological contract theory to explain psychological contract violation as a threat to IT megaproject success. Our research model suggests that the management of common understanding and expectations, moderated by political and public pressure of a public-private environment, affects the stability of the psychological contract and therefore the success of an <b>IT</b> megaproject <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> of public private partnerships...|$|R

25|$|There are {{anomalies}} for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, {{that are}} brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper's model of falsifiability {{as the key}} force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion more troubling than the Michelson-Morley experiment results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, {{from that of the}} logical positivists in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.|$|E
