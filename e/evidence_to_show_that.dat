5|$|Near human {{habitation}} {{the main}} predator {{of the common}} blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} earthworks comprising a ditch and rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E

5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

50|$|Yakshagana poetry (Kannada:ಯಕ್ಷಗಾನ ಪ್ರಸ೦ಗ, {{pronounced}} as yaksha-gaana prasanga)(Yakshagana Padya or Yakshagana Prasanga) is {{a collection}} of Kannada poems used to enact a music dance drama called Yakshagana. The poems are composed in well known Kannada metres using the frame work of Yakshagana Raga and Yakshagana Tala. Yakshagana also has what is called a Yakshagana metre. The collection of Yakshagana poems forming a musical drama is called a Prasanga. Oldest surviving parasanga books are believed to have been composed in the 15th century.

40|$|This report {{employed}} molecular statics simulation and density-functional-theory calculation {{to study}} the Poisson's ratios of face-centered-cubic materials. We provide numerical and theoretical <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> cubic materials can exhibit auxetic behavior in a principal direction under proper loading conditions. When a stress perpendicular to the loading direction is applied, cubic materials can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio at finite strain. The negative Poisson's ratio behavior, including its direction and value, is highly dependent on the direction and magnitude of the transversely applied stresses. As a result, we <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{it is possible to}} tune the direction and magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of cubic materials by controlling the transverse loadings. clos...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{properties}} of the partial transposition are not clear so far. Here the number of the negative eigenvalues of K(T) (the partial transposition of K) is considered carefully when K is a two-partite state. There are strong <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the number of negative eigenvalues of K(T) is N(N- 1) / 2 at most when K is a state in Hilbert space N*N. For the special case, 2 * 2 system(two qubits), we use this result to give a partial proof of the conjecture sqrt(K(T)) (T) >= 0. We find that this conjecture is strongly connected with the entanglement of the state corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of K(T) or the negative entropy of K...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a new {{approach}} to study undeniable signatures by translating secure digital signatures to secure undeniable signatures so that the existing algorithms can be used. Our mechanism is that any verifier without trapdoor information cannot distinguish whether a message is encoded from Di#e-Hellamn resource D or random resource R while a signer with trapdoor information can distinguish e#ciently a codeword which is computed from D or R. We show how our mechanism can be e#ciently achieved and provide proofs of security for our schemes in the standard complexity model. We also provide <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> our approach can be applied to construct designated confirmer signatures, designated verifier signatures as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to test some chelating compounds for their ability to retard urea hydrolysis in soils by inhibiting urease activity. The rationale behind evaluation of chelating compounds for inhibiting soil urease activity was that the chelating compounds are known to interfere with the functioning of enzymes involving sulphahydral (-SH) group like urease by chelating the functions having -SH groups. Also there are <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the chelating compounds have the ability to chelate with the metallic ions in enzymatic activities responsible for functioning of nitrifiers, mainly Nitrosomonas. * The effects of chelating compounds on soil urease have not been investigated and thus prompted evaluation of some chelating compounds for the purpose...|$|R
