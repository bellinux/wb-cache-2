Here, FAO highlight {{the long term}} need to avoid unprofitable overcapacity; an adaptation which increase the pressure on fish resources, fisheres are marginalized economically, allocation conflicts among fishermen and high public expenditures to manage the fisheries <b>egment.</b> Thus, in Norway the main management system refers to a bundled individual vessels quota system (IVQ) to regulate both inputand output in fisheries. Within the frame of such a closed and strict regime, fisheries should be sufficiently framed to avoid unprofitable overcapacity. However, overcapcity have still {{proven to be a}} difficult question in Norway. Since the late seventies, the topic of reducing overcapacity have been more or less continously on the political agenda. In this presentation, we highlight some core element of the ongoing discourse and we suggest some possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|In {{lifting a}} thing from lower {{part to the}} higher one or vice versa, there is needed an {{auxiliary}} apparatus; what is meant here is elevator (lift). In setting in moving an elevator, {{there should be a}} system to control the movement from the elevator in order to it can serve appropriately needed. Therefore, on the control system of this elevator prototype uses a microcontroller as its controller. Microcontroller used here is microcontroller ATMEGA 8535; because it has 3 external interrupt sources so that it is fulfilling all interrupt order in the elevator prototype. By using interrupt order, the elevator can serve many directions or orders that are given simultaneously. Then, it can prioritize the direction or order that should be fulfilled first. The purpose of this final project is to design the elevator prototype control system by using microcontroller Atmega 8535 and make the elevator prototype control system from that result design. Stage from this designing is design microcontroller Atmega 8535 series as central control from all series, H bridge series as movement control of elevator motor and elevator window, optocoupler censor series as position censor of elevator, limit switch series as command requesting and purpose, seven <b>egment</b> series as display from elevator position, and interrupt series as interrupt command from position, requesting and purpose. From this designing, it can be resulted the controller series of elevator by using microcontroller Atmega 8535...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{investigation}} f valley-wall faulting and {{its relationship}} to bathymetry focuses on the first two segments north of the Kane Fracture Zone. The valley-wall faults imaged by deep-towed sidescan sonar show aspects common to continental normal faults, and a similar erosional pattern, from a fresh fault surface, through eroded, talus covered scarps, to scarps draped with pelagic sediments. The first, southernmost <b>egment</b> is a symmetric graben at the segment centre, and an asymmetric half-graben at the northern end. The second, northern segment isan asymmetric half-graben for its entire length. The gross morphology is reflected in the faulting style, with multiple small faults at he symmetric graben, and one or two large faults on the eastern wall, defining the asymmetic half-graben. This difference in faulting style may reflect differences in depth to the brittle-ductile transition, with asymmetry occurring when the brittle-ductile transition is deep and brittle faults can cross the axial valley, locking faults on the other side. A gross estimate of horizontal strain accommodated by the valley-wall faults correlates well with valley-floor bathymetry, suggesting that bathymetric segmentation is partially due to tectonic thinning at segment ends. Bathymetric segmentation (e. g. Schouten et al. 1985) correlates with variation in the gravity along the ridge axis, expressed as the mantle Bouguer anomaly. Mantle Bouguer anomaly lows at the segment centres may either reflect hot, low density crust or mantle, thicker crust, or some combination of both (Lin et al. 1990). Recent refraction studies in the southern Atlan-tic (Tolstoy et al. 1993) indicate that crust thins at segment ends. Magma chambers at slow spread-ing ridges have not been imaged on seismic reflection surveys (Detrick et al. 1990), and it is believed that they are relatively small, tempo-rary features. The magma supply is considered to strongly affect local tectonics (Tapponier &...|$|E

40|$|Information {{on various}} aspects of actin {{molecules}} is summarized to obtain a possible structure of actin. Amino acid sequences cf 18 actins from various sources are aligned and location of possible secondary structures is predicted according to methods developed by Chou and Fasman, and by Rob-son. Profiles {{of the distribution of}} hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues along the sequence suggest that the molecule is composed of several domains. Furthermore, the search of homologous <b>egments</b> to those in proteins of known tertiary structures gives partial information on possible spatial structures of the segments. By utilizing the information on several characteristic sites of actin such as divalent cation binding site, the structure of an actin molecule in relation to polymerization sites and other interaction sites is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) imaging is the modality {{of choice}} for lung cancer diagnostics. With {{the increasing number of}} lung interventions on sublobar level in recent years, determining and visualizing pulmonary segments in CT images and, in oncological cases, reliable segment-related information about the location of tumors has become increasingly desirable. Computer-assisted identification of lung segments in CT images is subject of this work. Methods: The authors present a new interactive approach for the segmentation of lung segments that uses the Euclidean distance of each point in the lung to the segmental branches of the pulmonary artery. The aim is to analyze the potential of the method. Detailed manual pulmonary artery segmentations are used to achieve the best possible segment approximation results. A detailed description of the method and its evaluation on 11 CT scans from clinical routine are given. Results: An accuracy of 2 - 3 mm is measured for the s <b>egment</b> boundaries computed by the pulmonary artery-based method. On average, maximum deviations of 8 mm are observed. 135 intersegmental pulmonary veins detected in the 11 test CT scans serve as reference data. Furthermore, a comparison of the presented pulmonary artery-based approach to a similar approach that uses the Euclidean distance to the segmental branches of the bronchial tree is presented. It shows a significantly higher accuracy for the pulmonary artery-based approach in lung regions at least 30 mm distal to the lung hilum. Conclusions: A pulmonary artery-based determination of lung segments in CT images is promising. In the tests, the pulmonary artery-based determination {{has been shown to be}} superior to the bronchial tree-based determination. The suitability of the segment approximation method for application in the planning of segment resections in clinical practice has already been verified in experimental cases. However, automation of the method accompanied by an evaluation on a larger number of test cases is required before application in the daily clinical routine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{high-resolution}} seismic-reflection survey, {{conducted at}} the intersection of Arentson Gulch road and the western splay of the Lost River fault scarp in central Idaho, defines abedrock surface about 80 m deep which is segmented by several faults forming graben structures. Six meters of total fault displacement can be interpreted on the bedrock reflector while only 1 to 2 m of displacement can be observed on a shallower refracting interface and the surface fault scarp. This relatiVgly small displacement suggests the western splay has either been active only recently or extremely infrequently since deposition of the bedrock, or that strike-slip motion may be present. A westward eflection of the major activity along the Lost River fault was probably responsible for the gap in 1983 surface faulting between the Warm Spring and Thousand Springs <b>egments.</b> The inconsistency in total bed displace-ment based on reflection, refraction, and fault-scarp evidence suggests tectonic activity on the western splay spans more than just a single episode...|$|R
40|$|Segmented {{copolymers}} were synthesized from poly(tetramethylene oxide) with hydroxy end-groups or aliphatic diols and a short-chain diester diamide with {{a uniform}} length. The diester diamide (N,N'-bis(p-carbomethoxybenzoyl) butanediamine) (T = 257 °C) used {{is made from}} butanediamine and an excess of dimethyl terephthalate. The polymers are prepared in the melt with Ti(OCH 3 H 7) 4 as catalyst, for 30 min at 160 - 170 °C under atmospheric pressure and 60 min at 250 - 260 °C under a high vacuum. The polymers were studied by solution viscometry, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The melting and glass transition temperatures decreased with increasing soft-block length. The crystalline order of the uniform unit is high and not very dependent on the soft-block length. The rate of crystallization is very fast. The moduli of these polymers are hardly dependent on temperature in the region between Tg and T m.

40|$|Glycolate-containingp oly(tetramethyleneg lycol) s (PTHF-GA-OH) were {{prepared}} by the reaction of bifunctional living poly(tetrahydrofuran) with lithium bromide followed by the substitution reaction of the produced bromide end groups with potassium glycolate. The obtained polyols were reacted with 4, 4 '-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and then with 1, 4 -butanediol to give a polyurethane with degradable ester moieties. The treatment of the obtained polyurethane (PTHF-GA-BD-PU) with potassium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran/ethano(l 9 / 1 v/v) solvent {{in the presence of}} a small amount of water caused hydrolysis reaction of the glycolate ester linkages to give the mixture of PTMG and the urethane oligomers. The extraction of PTMG with methylene chloride from the mixture resulted in the recovery of PTMG in over 70 % yield based on the poly(tetrahydrofuran) s <b>egments</b> of PTHF-GA-BD-PU. E nzymatic degradation of PTHF-GA-BD-PU was carried out with lipase as a catalyst. The heterogeneous reaction with film specimens in water using phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 4) at 37 °C caused the decrease in the molecular weight of PTHF-GA-BD-PU. This is probably due to the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycolate ester groups of PTHF-GA-BD-PU...|$|R

Young males {{were more likely than}} young females to disperse during {{the first two years of}} life. Adult males had higher local survival than adult females during the summer months, probably because of the greater mortality risks to nesting females.
