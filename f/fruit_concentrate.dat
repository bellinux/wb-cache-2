50|$|In this process, {{the shell}} and seeds are removed, and the pulped fruit is {{made into a}} <b>fruit</b> <b>concentrate</b> or puree. Additional juice may be {{extracted}} from the remaining pulp by hot water. The juice is homogenized, slightly acidified to prevent gelling and improve the flavor, then treated with pectinase or other enzymes {{to break down the}} pectin. Most of the off-flavor agents are then removed with ion-exchange resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer or polyacrylic acid. Alternatively, the off-flavors can be adsorbed by agents like charcoal or bentonite, which are removed by filtration; or precipitated with gelatin or other gelling agents. Most of the remaining sulfurous volatiles are then removed by low-pressure evaporation. The juice is then pasteurized to inactivate remaining natural enzymes and kill micro-organisms. The process is claimed to preserve a substantial fraction of the mogrosides present in the fruit.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{all parts}} of the H. rhamnoides contain several {{bioactive}} compounds that can have positive health effects for humans as well as livestock. Particularly the fruit contain high vitamin C amounts, which exceed the ones of lemons and oranges.The H. rhamnoides fruits are processed in the food industry to different products. Usually, the berries are first washed and then pressed, resulting in press-cake and juice. The fruit press cake can be used to gain oil, natural food colour pigments (yellow/orange) or jam while the juice is further processed and then packaged as final juice product. Even in countries where there is no H. rhamnoides production, at least a few products can be found. It is usually possible to buy H. rhamnoides jam or <b>fruit</b> <b>concentrate,</b> fruit juices and some cosmetics, such as hand cream, shampoo or massage oils. In southern France for example, H. rhamnoides is commonly sold as fruit juice or as an ingredient in non-alcoholic and alcoholic mixed beverages.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{capability}} of drinks and foods to resist pH changes {{brought about by}} salivary buffering may {{play an important role}} in the dental erosion process in children. The aim of the present study was to test fruit yogurt, a popular snack for children, and the degrees of saturation (pK-pl) with respect to hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite to determine their erosive potential. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A variety of fruit yogurt was tested. To test the pH, 8 readings were taken with a pH electrode for each yogurt. Calcium content was detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, phosphorus by the inductively coupled plasma method, and fluoride content by ion chromatography. The degrees of saturation of hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite were calculated by use of a computer program. Statistical analysis was performed using 2 -tailed analysis of variance (P <. 05) and a post hoc test (Tukey) to determine differences between groups. RESULTS: The pH of each <b>fruit</b> <b>concentrate</b> was significantly different, except for banana yogurt. Except for the phosphorus content of raspberry yogurt, the calcium and phosphorus content for each <b>fruit</b> <b>concentrate</b> were significantly different. Fluoride levels were the same for all yogurts tested, and the degrees of saturation of hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite was positive, indicating supersaturation. CONCLUSION: It could be stated that fruit yogurt has no erosive potential...|$|E

40|$|Concentrated fruit {{products}} {{have a significant}} place in modern consumption markets and are valuable semi-prepared food components to the bakery, dairy, confectionary, canning, baby food, frozen food, distilling and beverage industries. There is continuous pressure on the beverage industry {{to improve the quality}} of concentrated fruit products in order for reconstituted fruit beverages to compete with beverages that are made from fresh fruits. In recent years, Alicyclobacillus spp. have become a major concern to the beverage industry worldwide as many high-acid, concentrated fruit {{products have}} been found to be contaminated with these spoilage microbes. The thermo-acidophilic nature of alicyclobacilli and highly resistant endospores allows for their survival during the production of concentrated fruit products. Under favourable conditions, endospores can germinate and multiply to numbers high enough to cause spoilage and product deterioration through the production of chemical taint compounds. It is imperative to understand the nature of Alicyclobacillus within the <b>fruit</b> <b>concentrate</b> processing environment so as to develop effective control strategies and to prevent spoilage in juice and beverage products that are reconstituted from fruit concentrates.

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} {{accumulation}} of vegetative cells and endospores of Alicyclobacillus, as well as viable aerobic counts during the continuous production of apple juice concentrate. Methods and Results: Apples were processed for a continuous process running time of 108 h (processing rate 1 · 8 - 2 · 0 th- 1) without clean-in-place (CIP) procedures in-between different batches. Samples from single-strength apple juice, concentrate after evaporation (± 30 °Brix), the final product (concentrate pasteurized at 102 - 104 °C for 90 s) and condensate water (by-product of the juice concentration process) were collected every 12 h. From 12 to 84 h of processing, vegetative Alicyclobacillus counts in single-strength apple juice increased significantly (P< 0 · 05) from 1 to 3 · 15 log 10 CFUml- 1. Accumulation patterns of vegetative cells in apple concentrate and the final product were similar from 24 to 84 h of processing, with the respective counts increasing from 0 · 13 to 1 · 63 and 0 · 01 to 1 · 69 log 10 CFUml- 1. The highest Alicyclobacillus endospore counts in single-strength juice, concentrate and the final product was at 84 h of processing with 1 · 32, 1 · 59 and 1 · 64 log 10 CFUml- 1, respectively. Conclusions: Alicyclobacillus vegetative cells and endospores accumulate in fruit concentrates during a continuous process running time of 108 h.

40|$|Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the most nutritious and exotic fruit that is {{available}} in Malaysia. In this research,dragon <b>fruit</b> juice was <b>concentrated</b> by using freeze concentration process. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> juice can be preserved longer than non <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> juice. Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated fruit juice also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the fruit juice. In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the fruit juice final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and cooling medium temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit. Dragon fruit juice that was blended and standardized its initial concentration was put into the crystallization unit. The fruit juice spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and cooling medium temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the cooling medium in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the fruit juice was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best cooling medium temperature. The dragon fruit juice initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the fruit juice increased.
