5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting <b>design,</b> <b>Volume</b> One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E

Designing the part with a complex mechanism is one of the challenging process and addition to achieve the balance and desired mechanical performance brought to the right manufacture technique to fabricate. Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is brought forward to the newest fabrication technology in this field.

50|$|Following {{the death}} (21 October 1872) of their father, Fanny's {{children}} Herbert and Margaret Lindon set about looking for potential buyers of their mother’s relics. After {{negotiations with the}} Dilke family and R. M. Milnes, Herbert decided to publish the letters in book form and auction them some time after. “In February 1878 appeared a slim, elegantly <b>designed</b> <b>volume</b> of under two hundred pages. Edited with an introduction by another of the day’s prominent literary men, H. B. Foran, it was entitled simply Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne.” This move proved shrewd as {{the publication of the}} letters caused much interest in England and America. The letters were sold in March 1885 for £543 17s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{penstock}} delivering {{water to}} the power plant has a hydraulic head of 103 m and a <b>design</b> <b>volume</b> of [...] Pangue contributes 10% of the electricity fed into the Chilean integrated grid, making it the third larges power station after Ralco (...) and Pehuenche (...) [...] The dam is made of roller-compacted concrete, using about a million cubic meter of concrete. The dam and power plant were built from 1993 to 1996. Behind the dam lies a reservoir of 500 ha, 14 km long and 360 m wide. This makes {{it one of the}} most efficient large hydropower plants in the world, as measured by the relation between electricity production and area flooded. The construction of Pangue, just as the one of Ralco, generated controversies between environmentalists, the Government and the private power company Endesa, because the dam impacted the indigenous Pehuenche people, whitewater rafting areas and the rights of farmers further downstream.|$|E
50|$|Anaerobic lagoons are earthen basins with a usual {{depth of}} 8 feet, though greater depths are more {{beneficial}} to digestion as they minimize oxygen diffusion from the surface. To minimize leakage of animal waste {{into the ground}} water, newer lagoons are generally lined with clay Studies have shown that in fact the lagoons typically leak {{at a rate of}} approximately 1 mm/day, with or without a clay liner, because it is the sludge deposited {{at the base of the}} lagoon that limits the leakage rate, not the clay liner or underlying native soil. Anaerobic lagoons are not heated, aerated or mixed. Anaerobic lagoons are most effective in warmer temperatures; anaerobic bacteria are ineffective below 15°C. Lagoons must be separated from other structures by a certain distance to prevent contamination. States regulate this separation distance. The overall size of the lagoon is determined by addition of four components: minimum <b>design</b> <b>volume,</b> volume of manure storage between periods of disposal, dilution volume and the volume of sludge accumulation between periods of sludge removal.|$|E

40|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} of right-turn lanes at {{access points}} on urban two-lane and four-lane {{sections}} of the state highway system in Nebraska were developed in this research. The guidelines are {{based on the results of}} a benefit-cost analysis conducted over the range of conditions representative of those on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. The guidelines define the <b>design</b> hour traffic <b>volumes</b> for which the benefits of right-turn lanes exceed their costs. The benefits used in the analysis were operational and accident cost savings they provide to road users. The operational cost savings were those associated with reductions in stops, delay, and fuel consumption experienced by through traffic. These operational effects were determined by computer simulation. The accident cost savings were those associated with the reduction in accidents expected from the lower speed differences between right-turning and through traffic provided by right-turn lanes. The relationship between speed differential and accidents established by Solomon (14) was used to estimate the reduction in rearend accidents that would be expected to result from the provision of a right-turn lane. The right-turn lane costs used in the development of the guidelines were typical right-turn lane construction costs on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. These costs were computed as a function of roadway speed and right-of-way cost. The right-of-way costs used included zero for construction within the existing right-of-way and values representative of low, medium, and high urban right-of-way costs in Nebraska. ^ The guidelines define the right-turn <b>design</b> hour <b>volume</b> required to justify a right-turn lane as a function of the following factors: (1) directional <b>design</b> hour <b>volume,</b> (2) roadway speed, (3) number of lanes on the roadway, and (4) right-of-way cost. The guidelines indicate that the right-turn <b>design</b> hour <b>volume</b> that warrants a right-turn lane is lower on roadways with higher directional <b>design</b> hour <b>volumes</b> and higher roadway speeds, because the road user costs associated with the operational and safety effects of right turns are greater on higher-volume, higher-speed roadways. Likewise, the right-turn <b>design</b> hour <b>volume</b> required to justify a right-turn lane on a two-lane roadway is lower than that on a four-lane roadway. Comparison with guidelines developed by others indicates that the guidelines developed in this research are within the range of existing guidelines. In addition, they are more definitive than the other guidelines because they account for the effects of roadway speed and right-of-way costs. ...|$|R
