Only p-channel sleep transistors and a dual-threshold voltage CMOS technology are utilized to place an idle domino logic circuit into a low leakage state.

Similarly, the sleep switches added to the output nodes suppress the voltages across the <b>gate</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>layers</b> of the transistors in the fan-out gates, thereby minimizing the gate tunneling current. The proposed circuit technique lowers the total leakage power by up to 77 % and 97 % as compared to the standard dual-threshold voltage domino logic circuits at the high and low die temperatures, respectively. Similarly, a 22 % to 44 % reduction in the total leakage power is observed as compared to a previously published sleep switch scheme in a 45 -nm CMOS technology.

The semiconducting layer was deposited from a nanowire ink formulation at room temperature. The devices with 230 nm thick SiO 2 <b>gate</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>layers</b> show excellent output current-voltage characteristics with early saturation voltages under 2 volts, constant saturation current and exceptionally low dependence of saturation voltage with the gate field. Operational principles {{of these devices}} are markedly different from traditional ohmic-contact field-effect transistors (FETs), and are explained using the source-gated transistor (SGT) concept in which the semiconductor under the reverse biased Schottky source barrier is depleted leading to low voltage pinch-off and saturation of drain current. Device parameters including activation energy are extracted at different temperatures and gate voltages to estimate the Schottky barrier height for different electrode materials to establish transistor performance - barrier height relationships. Numerical simulations are performed using 2 D thin-film approximation of the device structures at various Schottky barrier heights. Without any adjustable parameters and only assuming low p-doping of the transistor channel, the modelled data show exceptionally good correlation with the measured data. From both experimental and simulation results, it is concluded that source-barrier controlled nanowire transistors have excellent potential advantages compared with a standard FET including mitigation of short-channel effects, insensitivity in device operating currents to device channel length variation, higher on/off ratios, higher gain, lower power consumption and higher operational speed for solution processable and printable nanowire electronics.

While the {{electrical}} transport characteristics of organic electronic devices are generally inferior to their inorganic counterparts, organic materials offer many advantages over inorganics. The {{materials used in}} organic devices can often be deposited using cheap and simple processing techniques such as spincoating, inkjet printing, or roll-to-roll processing; allow for large-scale, flexible devices; and can have the added benefits of being transparent or biodegradable. In this manuscript, we examine the role of solvents {{in the performance of}} pentacene-based devices using the ferroelectric copolymer polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFe) as a <b>gate</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>layer.</b> High dipole moment solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, used to dissolve the copolymer for spincoating increase the charge carrier mobility in field-effect transistors (FETs) by nearly an order of magnitude as compared to lower dipole moment solvents. The polarization in Al/PVDF-TrFe/Au metal-ferroelectric-metal devices also shows an increase in remnant polarization of ~ 20 % in the sample using dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent for the ferroelectric. Interestingly, at low applied electric fields of ~ 100 MV/m a remnant polarization is seen in the high dipole moment device that is nearly 3. 5 times larger than the value observed in the lower dipole moment samples, suggesting that the degree of dipolar order is higher at low operating voltages for the high dipole moment device. This work shows that the performance of electronic devices can be improved simply by selection of fabrication materials, potentially opening up simpler fabrication processes for large scale manufacturing of organic electronics. We will also discuss the use of peptide-based nanostructures derived from natural amino acids as building blocks for biocompatible devices.
