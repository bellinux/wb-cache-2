500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> rust/before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
500|$|A {{successful}} summer {{followed for}} the Argentine. In July, del Potro {{and his team}} decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. [...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{was raised}} in the Episcopal Church and has {{remained}} an Episcopalian throughout her life. After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your own faith. But first I always pray. I pray before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E

2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, he was {{a little}} man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid much for it in the first place. The work put into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, 'Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady. I'd do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling." ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot express to {{you what}} entire {{enjoyment}} I find in this first visit to this prodigious metropolis of yours. Its wonders {{seem to me to}} be limitless. I go about as in a dream--as in a realm of enchantment--where many things are rare and beautiful, and all things are strange and marvellous. Hour after hour I stand--I stand spellbound, as it were--and gaze upon the statuary in Leicester Square. [Leicester Square being a horrible chaos, with the relic of an equestrian statue in the centre, the king being headless and limbless, and the horse in little better condition.] I visit the mortuary effigies of noble old Henry VIII., and Judge Jeffreys, and the preserved gorilla, and try to make up my mind which of my ancestors I admire the most. I go to that matchless Hyde Park and drive all around it, and then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> enter it at the Marble Arch---and--am induced to [...] "change my mind." [...] [Cabs are not permitted in Hyde Park--nothing less aristocratic than a private carriage.] It is a great benefaction--is Hyde Park. There, in his hansom cab, the invalid can go--the poor, sad child of misfortune--and insert his nose between the railings, and breathe the pure, health--giving air of the country and of heaven. And if he is a swell invalid, who isn't obliged to depend upon parks for his country air, he can drive inside--if he owns his vehicle. I drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it the more grateful I am that the margin is extensive.|$|E

6000|$|Belfast {{was lost}} in a round-eyed meditation. One or two vaulted heavily into upper berths, and, once there, sighed; others dived head first inside lower bunks--swift, and turning round {{instantly}} upon themselves, like animals going into lairs. The grating of a knife scraping burnt clay was heard. Knowles grinned no more. Davis said, {{in a tone of}} ardent conviction: [...] "Then our skipper's looney." [...] Archie muttered: [...] "My faith! we haven't heard the last of it yet!" [...] Four bells were struck.--"Half our watch below gone!" [...] cried Knowles in alarm, then reflected. [...] "Well, two hours' sleep is something towards a rest," [...] he observed, consolingly. Some already pretended to slumber; and Charley, sound asleep, suddenly said a few slurred words in an arbitrary, blank voice.--"This blamed boy has worrums!" [...] commented Knowles from under a blanket, in a learned manner. Belfast got up and approached Archie's berth.--"We pulled him out," [...] he whispered, sadly.--"What?" [...] said the other, with sleepy discontent.--"And now we will have to chuck him overboard," [...] went on Belfast, whose lower lip trembled.--"Chuck what?" [...] asked Archie.--"Poor Jimmy," [...] breathed out Belfast.--"He be blowed!" [...] said Archie with untruthful brutality, and sat up in his bunk; [...] "It's all through him. If it hadn't been for me, there would have been murder on board this ship!"--"'Tain't his fault, is it?" [...] argued Belfast, in a murmur; [...] "I've put him to bed... an' he ain't no heavier than an empty beef-cask," [...] he added, with tears in his eyes. Archie looked at him steadily, then turned his nose to the ship's side with determination. Belfast wandered about as though he had lost his way in the dim forecastle, and nearly fell over Donkin. He contemplated him from on high for a while. [...] "Ain't ye going to turn in?" [...] he asked. Donkin looked up hopelessly.--"That black'earted Scotch son of a thief kicked me!" [...] he whispered from the floor, in a tone of utter desolation.--"And a good job, too!" [...] said Belfast, still very depressed; [...] "You were as near hanging as damn-it to-night, sonny. Don't you play any of your murthering games around my Jimmy! You haven't pulled him out. You just mind! 'Cos if <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> kick you"--he brightened up a bit--"if <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> kick you, it will be Yankee fashion--to break something!" [...] He tapped lightly with his knuckles the top of the bowed head. [...] "You moind that, my bhoy!" [...] he concluded, cheerily. Donkin let it pass.--"Will they split on me?" [...] he asked, with pained anxiety.--"Who--split?" [...] hissed Belfast, coming back a step. [...] "I would split your nose this minyt if I hadn't Jimmy to look after! Who d'ye think we are?" [...] Donkin rose and watched Belfast's back lurch through the doorway. On all sides invisible men slept, breathing calmly. He seemed to draw courage and fury from the peace around him. Venomous and thin-faced, he glared from the ample misfit of borrowed clothes as if looking for something he could smash. His heart leaped wildly in his narrow chest. They slept! He wanted to wring necks, gouge eyes, spit on faces. He shook a dirty pair of meagre fists at the smoking lights. [...] "Ye're no men!" [...] he cried, in a deadened tone. No one moved. [...] "Yer 'aven't the pluck of a mouse!" [...] His voice rose to a husky screech. Wamibo darted out a dishevelled head, and looked at him wildly. [...] "Ye're sweepings ov ships! I 'ope you will all rot before you die!" [...] Wamibo blinked, uncomprehending but interested. Donkin sat down heavily; he blew with force through quivering nostrils, he ground and snapped his teeth, and, with the chin pressed hard against the breast, he seemed busy gnawing his way through it, as if to get at the heart within....|$|E
