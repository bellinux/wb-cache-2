60|$|Great was Bradley's {{relief when}} he found the water no more than waist deep and beneath his feet a firm, <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom.</b> Feeling his way {{cautiously}} he moved downward with the current, which was not so strong as he had imagined from {{the noise of the}} running water.|$|E

60|$|The <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom</b> of the rivulet made {{fairly good}} walking, and as Virginia was borne in a litter between two {{powerful}} lascars {{it was not}} even necessary that she wet her feet in the ascent of the stream to the camp. The distance was short, {{the center of the}} camp being but a mile from the harbor, and less than half a mile from the opposite shore of the island which was but two miles at its greatest breadth, and two and a quarter at its greatest length.|$|E
60|$|Gray dawn {{found him}} in the saddle again headed for the river. Half an hour of riding {{brought him to the}} dense {{chaparral}} and willow thickets. These he threaded to come at length to the ford. It was a <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom,</b> and therefore an easy crossing. Once upon the opposite shore he reined in his horse and looked darkly back. This action marked his acknowledgment of his situation: he had voluntarily sought the refuge of the outlaws; he was beyond the pale. A bitter and passionate curse passed his lips as he spurred his horse into the brakes on that alien shore.|$|E

6000|$|Thus then he disappeared, was rarified; For 'tis {{improper}} {{speech to}} say he died: He was exhaled; his great Creator drew His spirit, as the sun the morning dew.

It spawns in moderately fast riffles over clean gravel.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the Hungerford's crawling water beetle requires cool (15 - 25 C), swift flowing alkaline streams with sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>bottoms.</b> While in their larval stage, the beetles gather in concentrations of microalgae and in slower moving waters. The beetles {{are thought to have}} historically favored beaver dams.|$|R

40|$|Dwarf wedgemussels {{generally}} live in {{creek and}} river bottoms where sand is {{a component of}} the substrate (e. g., muddy sand, sand, sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>bottoms),</b> the current is slow to moderate, and there is little silt deposition (USFWS 1993). This species is discontinuously distributed in the Atlantic coast drainages from Maine to North Carolina (NatureServe 2010) ...|$|R
50|$|Quillback Carpsuckers usually feed in schools. They are omnivores {{and bottom}} feeders that prefer lakes, {{rivers and streams}} in which the water is clear at the bottom. The school of Quillbacks move slowly over a sand or <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom</b> when they eat. Their typical diet {{consists}} of insect larvae and various aquatic vegetation, crustaceans, and protozoa including algae, leaves, mollusks, and clams.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Renwick, {{because of}} its location, depth, and the {{fertility}} of its fishery, is especially adapted {{to serve as a}} breeding location for wading birds. Unlike many Illinois lakes, this body of water has a <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom,</b> not mud. According to the Illinois Audubon Society, the heron rookery located within the lake is [...] "by far the most valuable rookery in all of Illinois [...] [...] [...] a site of outstanding statewide significance." ...|$|E
50|$|It is a {{riverine}} fish but is {{also found}} in reservoirs. The distribution is in lowland areas and underhills, and the fish prefer river stretches with strong currents, including rapids. Larvae and juveniles have a superior mouth, but at 3-4 months they change to adult feeding mode (undermouth) and start grazing the bottom, eating benthic diatoms and detritus from hard substrate. Breeding females deposit sticky eggs on <b>gravel</b> <b>bottom</b> in shallow parts of rivers with moderate to strong current.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Mexico {{where it is}} only found {{on the eastern side}} of the Gulf of California, between the states of Sonora and Nayarit.

Its habitat includes streams, brackish lagoons, estuaries and mangrove areas, with sand, mud or <b>gravel</b> <b>bottoms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{habitat for}} this species is within mud, sand, or <b>gravel</b> <b>bottoms</b> from 0-375 m (1230 ft), but most {{commonly}} above 146 m (479 ft). They are usually found near shore and often enter brackish or even fresh water on occasion. [...] Highly salinated water is something this fish stays away from {{because of its}} inability to keep its cells from becoming hypersalinated.|$|R
