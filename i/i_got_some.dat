500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> big shots, so it went well for me. It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A8963 was rebuilt with a 200hp (149kW) Hispano-Suiza engine, and {{modified}} wings as the F.B.16D, emerging {{in this form}} in June 1917. It was armed with a single Lewis gun mounted between the cylinder banks of the engine and firing through a hollow propeller shaft, while a second Lewis gun was mounted on a sliding mount above the upper wing. [...] Performance was once again good, impressing the fighter pilot and air ace James McCudden, who recorded reaching a speed of 136mph (219km/h), stating [...] "Whilst flying this machine <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> idea {{of the speed of}} future machines, for at 10,000ft it was 30mph faster than anything I had yet flown." [...] Officials were less impressed with the FB.16D, however, it being criticised for structural problems and maintenance access, being described as [...] "not considered suitable in its present form for active service".|$|E

60|$|Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I {{knew what}} I had to do, and I did it mechanically.

All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket {{in one of them}} was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.|$|E
