5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square <b>head</b> set <b>screw</b> refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a <b>hexagon</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> hollow set <b>screw,</b> for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set <b>screw,</b> Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw</b> (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw,</b> and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw</b> ever made in this country U.S.."

5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ⌴) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw,</b> is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a dog clutch). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screws</b> fasten the shell to the arbor.|$|R
50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set <b>screws,</b> and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screws,</b> and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> adjustment <b>screw.</b> This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|R
40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle bolted assembly was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The bolted assembly performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw</b> and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R
5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> {{are usually}} made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw</b> or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to {{many different types of}} sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set <b>screws</b> (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force. The tightening tests were performed {{with the aid of a}} microprocessor controlled torque wrench and a torque-tension testing rig. Load cells fitted to the test rig provided an accurate measurement of the joint clamp load and the faster thread and underhead torque distribution under a range of lubrication conditions. Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield tightening, and during loosening. The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener. It was shown that the design of bolted joints must take account of the influence of friction if thejoints are to operate effectively in service. ...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap <b>screw,</b> allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R

50|$|By design, Torx <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Whereas Phillips <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7  years; range: 65 – 96  years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1  years (range: 1 – 3  years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 – 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12  months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12  months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients’ fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures. The function of the patients is good or excellent in most cases; however, it declines, especially for those patients with age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types...|$|R
