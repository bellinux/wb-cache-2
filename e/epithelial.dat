5|$|Endometrial cancers may be tumours {{derived from}} <b>epithelial</b> cells (carcinomas), mixed <b>epithelial</b> and mesenchymal tumours (carcinosarcomas), or mesenchymal tumours.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epithelial</b> {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. <b>Epithelial</b> cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the <b>epithelial</b> cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated <b>epithelial</b> lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the <b>epithelial</b> lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The <b>epithelial</b> cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of <b>epithelial</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|The <b>epithelial</b> cells {{throughout}} the respiratory tract secrete <b>epithelial</b> lining fluid (ELF), {{the composition of}} which is tightly regulated and determines how well mucociliary clearance works.|$|E
5|$|Animal tissues can {{be grouped}} into four basic types: connective, <b>epithelial,</b> muscle and nervous tissue.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated <b>epithelial</b> cells (or cells showing characteristics of <b>epithelial</b> differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{analysis}} of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma, a low-grade <b>epithelial</b> cancer with a low potential for metastasis.|$|E
5|$|Milk lipids are {{secreted}} in {{a unique}} manner by lactocytes, which are specialized <b>epithelial</b> cells within the alveoli of the lactating mammary gland.|$|E
5|$|Susumu Ito {{describes}} Campylobacter-like organisms {{attached to}} a gastric <b>epithelial</b> cell.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} <b>epithelial</b> {{cells that}} make up the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an <b>epithelial</b> lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
5|$|Metastasis of {{lung cancer}} {{requires}} transition from <b>epithelial</b> to mesenchymal cell type. This may occur through activation of signaling pathways such as Akt/GSK3Beta, MEK-ERK, Fas, and Par6.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of <b>epithelial</b> cells known as the <b>epithelial</b> cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing <b>epithelial</b> surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing <b>epithelial</b> surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{are larger}} and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete <b>epithelial</b> lining fluid, and lung surfactant. Type II cells {{are able to}} divide and {{differentiate}} to Type 1 cells.|$|E
5|$|Undifferentiated endometrial carcinomas make up {{less than}} 1–2% of {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancers. They have a worse prognosis than grade III tumors. Histologically, these tumors show sheets of identical <b>epithelial</b> cells with no identifiable pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the gingiva and the tooth is called the dentogingival junction. This junction has three <b>epithelial</b> types: gingival, sulcular, and junctional epithelium. These three types form from a mass of <b>epithelial</b> cells known as the <b>epithelial</b> cuff between the tooth and the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Fibroadenoma of {{the breast}} is a benign tumor {{composed}} of a biphasic proliferation of both stromal and <b>epithelial</b> components that can be arranged in two growth patterns: pericanalicular (stromal proliferation around <b>epithelial</b> structures) and intracanalicular (stromal proliferation compressing the <b>epithelial</b> structures into clefts).|$|E
25|$|EpCAM (<b>epithelial</b> cell {{adhesion}} molecule, ESA, TROP1) is hemophilic Ca2+-independent {{cell adhesion}} molecule expressed on the basolateral surface of most <b>epithelial</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|In <b>epithelial</b> tumors, the epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{is considered}} to be a crucial event. EMT and the reverse transition from mesenchymal to an <b>epithelial</b> phenotype (MET) are involved in embryonic development, which involves disruption of <b>epithelial</b> cell homeostasis and the acquisition of a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. EMT appears to be controlled by canonical pathways such as WNT and transforming growth factor β.|$|E
25|$|Research on paracrine {{signaling}} {{through the}} Jak-STAT pathway revealed its potential in activating invasive behavior of ovarian <b>epithelial</b> cells. This <b>epithelial</b> to mesenchymal transition is highly evident in metastasis. Paracrine signaling through the Jak-STAT pathway {{is necessary in}} the transition from stationary <b>epithelial</b> cells to mobile mesenchymal cells, which are capable of invading surrounding tissue. Only the Jak-STAT pathway {{has been found to}} induce migratory cells.|$|E
25|$|CD10 may {{differentiate}} {{basal cell}} carcinoma (CD10 <b>epithelial</b> staining) from trichoblastoma (CD10 peritumoral stromal staining), {{basal cell carcinoma}} with follicular differentiation (CD10 stromal and <b>epithelial</b> staining) and squamous cell carcinoma (strong stromal staining).|$|E
25|$|Corneal nerves of the subepithelial layer {{terminate}} {{near the}} superficial <b>epithelial</b> {{layer of the}} cornea in a logarithmic spiral pattern. The density of <b>epithelial</b> nerves decreases with age, especially after the seventh decade.|$|E
25|$|In <b>epithelial</b> {{cells with}} motile cilia lining the {{bronchus}} and the oviduct, CFTR {{is located on}} the cell membrane but not on cilia. In contrast, ENaC (<b>Epithelial</b> sodium channel) is located along {{the entire length of the}} cilia.|$|E
25|$|In primary infection, EBV {{replicates}} in oro-pharyngeal <b>epithelial</b> {{cells and}} establishes Latency III, II, and I infections in B-lymphocytes. EBV latent infection of B-lymphocytes {{is necessary for}} virus persistence, subsequent replication in <b>epithelial</b> cells, and release of infectious virus into saliva. EBV Latency III and II infections of B-lymphocytes, Latency II infection of oral <b>epithelial</b> cells, and Latency II infection of NK- or T-cell can result in malignancies, marked by uniform EBV genome presence and gene expression.|$|E
25|$|In vitro, {{exposure}} of human bronchial <b>epithelial</b> cells or human pulmonary alveolar <b>epithelial</b> cells to agents such as hydrogen peroxide or bleach produces {{a time and}} toxin-dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability. Cells exposed to these agents demonstrate significant ATP depletion, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation, followed by death allowing for evaluation of novel cytoprotective agents. Potential tissue reparative agents can be evaluated in vitro by determining their effects on stimulation of pulmonary and airway <b>epithelial</b> cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Interstitial macrophages and <b>epithelial</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{positioning}} of the osteoprogenitor cell condensations determines the cell lineage before the signalling molecules can. This is due to their positions relative to any <b>epithelial</b> surfaces. Osteoblastic and chondrogenic condensations differ in their biophysical parameters within the embryo. Their distance {{in relation to the}} nearest <b>epithelial</b> surface will determine the cell lineage. For example osteoblastic condensations are closer to <b>epithelial</b> surfaces so they will be exposed to more biophysical and biochemical stimuli due to the proximity and increased cell-epithelial interactions.|$|E
25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the {{secretory}} dimer) {{is produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of <b>epithelial</b> cells, and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the luminal surface of the <b>epithelial</b> cells, still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the secretory component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the mucus layer covering the <b>epithelial</b> cells. In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the <b>epithelial</b> cells is formed.|$|E
25|$|Within <b>epithelial</b> cells, only Latency II is possible.|$|E
25|$|The lytic cycle, or {{productive}} infection, {{results in}} the production of infectious virions. EBV can undergo lytic replication in both B cells and <b>epithelial</b> cells. In B cells, lytic replication normally only takes place after reactivation from latency. In <b>epithelial</b> cells, lytic replication often directly follows viral entry.|$|E
25|$|CSCs {{have been}} {{identified}} in various solid tumors. Markers specific for normal stem cells are commonly used for isolating CSCs from solid and hematological tumors. Cell surface markers have proved useful for isolation of CSC-enriched populations including CD133 (also known as PROM1), CD44, CD24, EpCAM (<b>epithelial</b> cell adhesion molecule, also known as <b>epithelial</b> specific antigen, ESA), THY1, ATP-binding cassette B5 (ABCB5), and CD200.|$|E
25|$|Surface epithelial-stromal tumour, {{also known}} as ovarian <b>epithelial</b> carcinoma, {{is the most common}} type of ovarian cancer, {{representing}} approximately 90% of ovarian cancers. It includes serous tumour, endometrioid tumor, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Less common tumors are malignant Brenner tumor and transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary. <b>Epithelial</b> ovarian cancers develop from the epithelium, a layer of cells that covers the ovary.|$|E
25|$|The CFTR {{is found}} in the <b>epithelial</b> cells of many organs {{including}} the lung, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, and the reproductive tract. In the skin CFTR is strongly expressed in the sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands. In the eccrine glands, CFTR is located on the apical membrane of the <b>epithelial</b> cells that make up the duct of these sweat glands.|$|E
25|$|High {{calcium intake}} {{decreases}} fat-induced <b>epithelial</b> hypoproliferation of mammary gland and chemically induced carcinogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Important {{differences}} exist between integrin-signaling in circulating blood cells and non-circulating cells such as <b>epithelial</b> cells; integrins of circulating cells are normally inactive. For example, cell membrane integrins on circulating leukocytes are maintained in an inactive state to avoid <b>epithelial</b> cell attachment; they are activated only {{in response to}} stimuli such as those received {{at the site of}} an inflammatory response. In a similar manner, integrins at the cell membrane of circulating platelets are normally kept inactive to avoid thrombosis. <b>Epithelial</b> cells (which are non-circulating) normally have active integrins at their cell membrane, helping maintain their stable adhesion to underlying stromal cells that provide signals to maintain normal functioning.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D and analogs {{are used}} to {{downregulate}} the cutaneous immune system and <b>epithelial</b> proliferation while promoting differentiation.|$|E
25|$|The high {{prevalence}} of IgA in mucosal areas {{is a result}} of a cooperation between plasma cells that produce polymeric IgA (pIgA), and mucosal <b>epithelial</b> cells that express an immunoglobulin receptor called the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). pIgA is released from the nearby activated plasma cells and binds to pIgR. This results in transportation of IgA across mucosal <b>epithelial</b> cells and its cleavage from pIgR for release into external secretions.|$|E
