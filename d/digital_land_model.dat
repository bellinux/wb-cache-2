40|$|The diploma thesis {{discusses}} the mass balance of Cerknica Lake, {{known as the}} most famous intermittent lake in the world. The lake is in avegare present for {{three quarters of a}} year, and for a quarter of a year, the bottom of Cerknica Polje is dry. Nearly every year, the lake expands to the size of 20 square kilometers, and the volume of 29 million cubic meters of water. Before calculating the mass balance of the lake, I have designed a terain model with the programme AutoCAD Civil 3 D, based on the data from the <b>digital</b> <b>land</b> <b>model.</b> According to the designed terain model and a daily change of water level on the hydrometric station Dolenje Jezero, I have calculated daily change of the volume of water and by using this data, I have calculated the water ballance of the lake. The established mass balance of the lake is based on the rate of flow and concentration of parameters, observed on the inflows and swallow holes, by the Slovenian Environment Agency. Various quality parametes have been observed (ammonium, ortophosphates, nitrates, nitrites), with the emphasis on phosphorus and nitrogen which are the most important indicators of water quality. More nutrients come to the lake than flow out of it which means the lake has the capacity to clean itself. The only exceptions are the nitrites and ammonium which are produced in the lake. I have also calculated the impact on the lake of phosphorus and nitrogen which come to the lake from the hydrology. The calculations have been made for the period between years 2004 and 2014, In the year 2014, 29 tones of phosphorus and 457 tones of nitrogen have come into the lake. The calculation of phosphorus concentration has also been done with the Vollenweider model. By comparing calculations with observed values, observed by the Slovenian Environment Agency, I have established that this model is not suitable for calculations, due to the intermittent nature of the lake...|$|E

However, {{a serious problem}} of this approach may arise when using a 2 -D surface flow model which exchanges flows through adjacent cells, or conventional rink removal algorithms which also allow flow to be exchanged along diagonal directions, due {{to the existence of}} artificial depression in DEMs. This study firstly analyses the two types of depressions in DEMs and reviews the current depression filling algorithms with a medium sized basin in South-East England, the Upper Medway Catchment (220 km 2 ) used to demonstrate the depression issue in 2 -D surface runoff simulation by MIKE SHE with different DEM resolutions (50 m, 100 m and 200 m). An alternative depression-filling algorithm for 2 -D overland flow modelling is developed and evaluated by comparing the simulated flows at the outlet of the catchment. This result suggests that the depression estimates at different grid resolution of DEM highly influences overland flow estimation and the new depression filling algorithm is shown to be effective in tackling this issue when comparing simulations in sink-dominated and sink-free digital elevation models, especially for depressions in relatively flat areas on <b>digital</b> <b>land</b> surface <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} {{a framework for}} automatic feature extraction from images using stochastic geometry. Features in images are modeled as realizations of a spatial point process of geometrical shapes. This framework allows the incorporation of a priori knowledge on the spatial repartition of features. More specifically, we present a model based on the superposition of a process of segments and a process of rectangles. The former {{is dedicated to the}} detection of linear networks of discontinuities, while the latter aims at segmenting homogeneous areas. An energy is defined, favoring connections of segments, alignments of rectangles, as well as a relevant interaction between both types of objects. The estimation is performed by minimizing the energy using a simulated annealing algorithm. The proposed model is applied to the analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). These images are raster data representing the altimetry of a dense urban area.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{implications}} of La Nina meteorological variability is the increase in frequency of extreme meteorological events, especially rainfall. In 2011 and 2012, southeast Queensland endured several extreme weather events, which resulted in major flood events in Brisbane, Toowoomba, Lockyer Valley and areas of the Sunshine Coast. These events prompted an inquiry into flood management practices associated with extreme rainfall. The recommendations from the Flood Inquiry Commission Report included the need for improved modelling of flood behaviour, especially for local areas. As a result, local authorities have now been given responsibility for forecasting flash floods. Accordingly, a project is being undertaken to develop a methodology for deriving a flash flood index using GIS data sets. This study proposes utilisation of high-resolution <b>digital</b> elevation <b>models,</b> <b>land</b> use maps, and derived catchment characteristics.
