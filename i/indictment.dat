5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an <b>indictment</b> against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of <b>Indictment</b> against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under <b>indictment</b> no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|Burton was reindicted, {{still in}} the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation. The new <b>indictment</b> had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that Burton had agreed to receive {{compensation}} from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto.

Unlike the first <b>indictment,</b> the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first <b>indictment</b> alleged only compensated representation, the second <b>indictment</b> also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E
5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the <b>indictment</b> without returning to a grand jury. But, the government may narrow the <b>indictment</b> without so returning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indictments</b> Act 1915 (5 & 6 Geo 5. c.90) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that made}} {{significant}} {{changes to the}} law relating to <b>indictments.</b> The law relating to <b>indictments</b> evolved during {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries and became lengthy, confusing and highly technical to the point where some barristers specialised entirely in drawing up <b>indictments.</b> During the nineteenth century several Acts were passed by Parliament to correct this problem, but none were entirely successful. In 1913 Lord Haldane created a committee to draw up a draft bill reforming the law of <b>indictments,</b> which became the <b>Indictments</b> Act 1915.|$|R

In 1986, there were 916 <b>indictments</b> of public officials for corruption, 320 of which concerned state and local officials.

5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an <b>indictment</b> against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the <b>indictment,</b> assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an <b>indictment.</b> Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the <b>indictment</b> was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the <b>indictment</b> was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the <b>indictment</b> was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E
