The Aerospace Research Laboratory at The University of Virginia is involved in a project to validate computational fluid dynamics calculations for use in design of scramjet engines. One important parameter used in optimizing performance of scramjets is combustion efficiency. To determine the combustion efficiency of a model scramjet a technique to measure water vapor concentration produced in the combustor is being developed. In a hydrogen fueled scramjet the combustion efficiency can be calculated by measuring the amount water vapor leaving the combustor and finding it’s ratio to the amount of fuel supplied.
