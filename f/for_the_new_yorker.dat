5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at The New Yorker, which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The New Yorker published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|With the {{emergence}} of The New Yorker, Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Scott B. Smith had {{published}} {{a short story}} <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> the magazine's fiction editor learned of his then-unpublished novel A Simple Plan before reading it and forwarding it to an agent. Shortly thereafter, Smith learned that Mike Nichols was interested in purchasing the film rights to his novel. Nichols spent a weekend reading the book, before contacting Smith's agent, and finalizing a deal the following Monday morning. Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $250,000, with an additional $750,000 to come later from a studio interested in pursuing the project. Smith’s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio, Savoy Pictures. However, due to scheduling conflicts with a planned film adaptation of All the Pretty Horses, Nichols {{stepped down from the}} project.|$|E
5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, and, he said, shed tears of joy at owning {{a home for the}} first time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and to summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> The New York Review of Books, and other magazines.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.|$|E

50|$|Boston made {{it plain}} {{they would not}} play around with New York this year, with two big double-digit romps to start the series. The Knicks, clearly now led by their stellar {{backcourt}} of Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe, showed some heart by beating Boston in Boston in Game Three. But that proved a final parting shot <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> {{who had been in}} three of the last four NBA Finals. Havlicek made sure of that almost single-handedly, leading a 4-1 series win.|$|R
5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E
