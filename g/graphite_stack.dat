Results of the measurement have been compared to a modeled theoretical computation. In the first set of experiments, we measured the effective decay constant of the neutron population in ten <b>graphite</b> <b>stacks</b> as a function of time after the source burst. We found the decay to be non-exponential in the six smallest assemblies, while in three larger assemblies the decay was exponential over {{a significant portion of the}} total measuring interval. The decay in the largest stack was exponential over the entire ten millisecond measuring interval. The non-exponential decay mode occurred when the effective decay constant exceeded 1600 sec^(- 1). In a second set of experiments, we measured the spatial dependence of the neutron population in four <b>graphite</b> <b>stacks</b> as a function of time after the source pulse. By doing an harmonic analysis of the spatial shape of the neutron distribution, we were able to compute the effective decay constants of the first two spatial modes. In addition, we were able to compute the time dependent effective wave number of neutron distribution in the stacks. Finally, we used a Laplace transform technique and a simple modeled scattering kernel to solve a diffusion equation for the time and energy dependence of the neutron distribution in the <b>graphite</b> <b>stacks.</b> Comparison of these theoretical results with the results of the first set of experiments indicated that more exact theoretical analysis would be required to adequately describe the experiments. The implications of our experimental results for the theory of pulsed neutron experiments in polycrystalline media are discussed in the last chapter. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{basal plane}} {{cleavage}} energy (CE) of graphite {{is a key}} material parameter for understanding many of the unusual properties of graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes. The CE is equal to twice the surface energy and {{is closely related to}} the interlayer binding energy and exfoliation energy of graphite. Nonetheless, a wide range of values for these properties have been reported and no consensus has yet emerged as to their magnitude. Here, we report the first direct, accurate experimental measurement of the CE of graphite using a novel method based on the recently discovered self-retraction phenomenon in graphite. The measured value, 0. 37 +/- 0. 01 J/m 2 for the incommensurate state of bicrystal graphite, is nearly invariant with respect to temperature (from 22 C to 198 C) and bicrystal twist angle, and insensitive to impurities (from the atmosphere).

Although the α-phase of PVDF is seen in the EG-based composites, a mixture of α- and β-phases is present in the FGS analogs. SEM and TEM imaging show smooth fractured surfaces with oriented platelets of <b>graphite</b> <b>stacks</b> and obvious debonding from the matrix in the EG-PVDF composites. In contrast, the FGS-PVDF composites show a wrinkled topography of relatively thin graphene sheets bonded well to the matrix. Storage modulus of the composites was increased with FGS and EG concentration. A lower percolation threshold (2 wt %) was obtained for FGSPVDF composites compared to EG-PVDF composites (above 5 wt %). Lastly, the FGS-PVDF composites show an unusual resistance/temperature behavior. The resistance decreases with temperature, indicating an NTC behavior, whereas EG-PVDF composites show a PTC behavior (e. g., the resistance increases with temperature). We attribute the NTC behavior of the FGS based composites to the higher aspect ratio of FGS which leads to contact resistance predominating over tunneling resistance. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|A European Community {{sponsored}} Project focused {{toward the}} setting-up {{of a chain}} of computational tools suitable for the deterministic safety analysis of transients expected in the RBMK NPP. The accident leading to the rupture of one fuel channel with fuel melting or high temperature damage, creep and brittie failure of the pressure tube and of graphite bricks with possibility of rupture propagation, constituted the reference scenario for the Project. Two chains of computational tools have been proposed and developed. The major effort was devoted to the development and the qualification of input decks or nodalisations for almost a dozen codes covering areas such as thermal-hydraulics, neutron kinetics, structural mechanics, nuclear fuel behaviour, fission product generation and transport. The Smolensk 3 was selected as reference NPP and non-licensing accident analyses were performed. A methodology was proposed for investigating the realism in the propagation of one pressure tube break to neighbouring pressure tubes, (i. e. addressing the MPTR issue).

40|$|Abstract. Fuel {{channels}} of nuclear reactors, which are major structural {{elements of a}} reactor core, have to meet strict requirements in terms of operational reliability. The middle part of the fuel channel, located in a <b>graphite</b> <b>stack,</b> is a tube made of a zirconium- 2. 5 % niobium alloy. However, zirconium alloys can pick up hydrogen during operation {{as a consequence of}} corrosion reaction with water. Hydrogen redistributes easily at elevated temperatures migrating down a temperature or concentration gradient and up a stress gradient. When the terminal solid solubility is exceeded in a component such as a pressure tube that is highly stressed for long periods of time, delayed hydride cracking failures may occur. To estimate degradation of the zirconium alloy in the presence of hydrides, predetermined amounts of hydrogen were added to the sections of the fuel channel tubes by electrolytic deposition of a layer of hydride {{on the surface of the}} pressure tube material followed by dissolving the hydride layer by diffusion annealing at an elevated temperature. For estimation of the concentration of zirconium hydride platelets in the zirconium alloy test samples ultrasonic testing methods were proposed. The first method is based on precise measurement of velocity of longitudinal and shear wave at different directions and the second is based on the investigation of high frequency ultrasonic signals backscattered in a focal zone of an ultrasonic transducer. The experimental investigations were performed on the zirconium alloy samples of different concentration of hydrides in the immersion tank at a room temperature. The results obtained on testing samples using different excitation conditions and different types of ultrasonic waves are presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the electronic structure and magnetic properties of hydrogenated graphite surfaces using van der Waals density functional theory (DFT) and model Hamiltonians.

On the contrary, when hydrogenation takes place {{on the surface of}} graphene multilayers or <b>graphite</b> (Bernal <b>stacking),</b> the interaction between hydrogen atoms competes with the different adsorption energies of the two sublattices. This competition may result in all hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the same sublattice and, thereby, in a ferromagnetic state for low concentrations. Based on the exchange couplings obtained from the DFT calculations, we have also evaluated the Curie temperature by mapping this system onto an Ising-like model with randomly located spins. Remarkably, the long-range nature of the magnetic coupling in these systems makes the Curie temperature size dependent and larger than room temperature for typical concentrations and sizes.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study has been}} completed {{in relation to the}} accident analysis of RBMK with key results documented in three companion papers in the present journal volume. The study also aimed at the comparison between selected accident analysis topics in Light Water Reactors (LWR) and RBMK. The relevance of the Fuel Channel Blockage (FCB) event within the area of accident analysis was conﬁrmed. Owing to the probability of occurrence, also connected with the large number of channels, estimated in the order of 10 − 2 /reactor/year, the FCB is actually part of the Design Basis Accidents (DBA) for the RBMK. In case the FCB is part of the DBA, a noticeable difference occurs in results from safety evaluations between LWR and RBMK: in the latter case, a DBA causes a loss of integrity for the pressure barrier and, though to a limited extent, damaged fuel overpasses such a barrier. The FCB event also causes contamination in reactor cavity and in selected parts of the overall conﬁnement, damage in various graphite blocks and, even excluding the MPTR risk owing to the ﬁndings from the second companion paper in this journal volume, mechanical loads on neighbouring fuel channels, <b>graphite</b> <b>stacks</b> and reactor tank that need extensive examination before reactor restart. Therefore, a proposal has been formulated for performing the feasibility analysis for the design of a system denominated ICM (Individual Channel Monitoring). The goal of the ICM is the early detection of the FCB event and the triggering of scram in such a way to prevent pressure tube damage and, deﬁnitely, over-passing of the pressure barrier by molten or damaged fuel during a DBA situation. The ICM is based upon the signals of pressure-drop (or ﬂow-rate) and ﬂuid temperature transducers installed in the bottom and the upper parts of the fuel channels, respectively. The performed study shows that steam superheating at fuel channel outlet occurs early after the blockage event and the related temperature signal can be used to cause scram.

In contrast, a clean surface does not host any surface bands in the energy range of the pi and sigma bands, and the LDOS near the surface is even depleted. On the other hand, displacement of even one single surface layer induces a surface band near K-M. A special role play p_z-bonded dimers (directed perpendicular to the layers) in the vicinity of one type of stacking faults.
