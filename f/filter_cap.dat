Conversion of 6146B to 6550 tubes has a dramatic impact on the output power. The amp will produce roughly 225 watts , due to the screen voltage being too low.

The frequency response of the miniature pore pressure transducer (Kyowa BP- 2 KDS Type) is firstly predicted within the theoretical framework proposed by Lee.

The pressure waveforms, measured by the fully saturated pore pressure transducerwith the sintered bronze <b>filtering</b> <b>cap</b> (average pore size of 10 μm and 40 μｍ), showed neither amplitude attenuation nor phase lag comparing to the actual pressure fluctuation, in case of the exciting frequency below 13 Hz. In contrast, the substantial attenuation and phase lag are observed in the measured waveforms in case that air bubbles are entrapped in the dead space of the transducer. The dynamic response predicted by Lee's theory compared favourably with what has been measured. The results demonstrate that it is crucial for the accurate measurement of dynamic pore pressure fluctuation, to keep the pore pressure transducer and the filter in fully saturated condition...|$|R

The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 5 million people in Nepal lack access to safe drinking water while globally, 1. 1 billion lack access to improved water supplies. Point-of-use water treatment technologies, such as household ceramic water filters, offer an affordable and effective means of treating water to standards suitable for drinking. The fact that ceramic water filters can be manufactured and produced by local ceramists with local materials makes ceramic filters particularly attractive as a point-of-use treatment technology that is affordable, appropriate, and sustainable. This thesis examines existing ceramic water filter technologies, production processes, and methods for bringing a low-cost ceramic water filter to market in Nepal. Three types of disk filters and five types of candle filters are evaluated in terms of microbiological removal efficiency and flow rate. A red-clay grog disk filter coated with colloidal silver {{and three of the}} five candle filters (Katadyn®, Ceradyn, Katadyn® Gravidyn, and the Hari Govinda white-clay candle <b>filter</b> <b>capped</b> on both ends) also coated with colloidal silver, performed the best in terms of microbiological removal efficiency (> 98 %) and flow rate (ranging from 641 mL/hr/candle (Ceradyn) to 844 mL/hr/candle (Gravidyn)). In addition to filter testing, a guideline for developing a ceramic water filter in preparation for bringing a product to market is presented, along with a discussion on the importance of laboratory and field testing to ensure overall product performance. A step-by-step summary of the production process is also presented along with a comparison of the theoretical flow rate through a candle filter versus a disk filter.

Cartridge filter systems also permit better water flow - thus, placing less strain on the filter pump. These types of filters are also easiest to clean by using a flow of high-pressure water from a hose.

The tight pleats, or folds, allow for a large amount of material to be used in a small container.

40|$|In {{semi-arid}} and arid areas rock weathering {{is normally}} much less deep that in rainy areas. So, rocks {{tend to be}} more near the topographic surface. These climatic conditions also generate much less vegetation, which in all the cases clearly favours a direct observation of rock condition, fracturing or weathering. By other side, aquifers in hard rocks present specificities in relation to water presence and movement that implies a different approach when dealing with groundwater prospecting. Hard rocks are considered to have basically 3 layers of interest for hydrogeology: the weathered zone on the top, the fractured zone under the first one, and the non-fractured zone under the last one, where the possibility to get water is very low. Water is stored in both fractures and rock matrix, but moves mainly through the fractures. The capacity to transmit water is much more related with the interconnection between fractures than with the storage capacity. Even if the storage capacity is high, if interconnection is not strong, a well will not be fully successful. As most part of the wells is vertical, attention must be concentrated on the tilt of fractures: vertical fractures are much more difficult to intersect with a vertical drilling than inclined ones, and horizontal fractures will be the most easy to cut. If vertical, horizontal and inclined fractures are present in the same area, if they interconnect and go deep enough, if their distribution in space is regular and if the space inside fractures is not filled with clay or other impermeable minerals, we are in presence of the best conditions to have a successful drilling. Attention must also be given to the total vertical length of the weathered layer or layers and to the estimated vertical extension of the fractured zone. Indirect indications may come from geophysics. The most used method seems to be the geoelectrics, followed by electromagnetic methods. Drilling methods are most part of the time rotopercussion. During drillings it is essential to register the lithologies, the fracturing levels and the water strikes. Registration of drilling velocities can be important to perceive the nature of rock (fracturing, weathering, etc.). A good planning, the right construction skills and a sustainable exploration plan are essential to have a durable working well, and to maintain the water quality on the well and in the aquifer. Isolation, protection, casing, <b>filters,</b> <b>caps</b> are some of the figures needing attention during construction which will help to maintain a sustainable water supply system...|$|R
40|$|Biologically active filters, or {{biological}} filters, remove particles and harness the metabolic capacity of bacteria attached to filtration media, {{in the form}} of a biofilm, to metabolize biodegradable organic matter (BOM). Pilot-scale biological filtration experiments were carried out at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to evaluate the impact of capping material selection and nutrient amendments for granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, on both traditional and biological filtration performance parameters. Traditional filtration parameters included filter effluent turbidity, head loss development, and filter run time. Biological filtration performance was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) removal. The top 20 cm layer of GAC (d 10 = 1. 3 mm) was replaced by a capping material with a larger effective size in three of the five pilot-scale filter columns—such use of capping layers in rapid biological filtration for drinking water treatment has not been reported previously. The capping materials that were investigated were an expanded clay (EC) aggregate (d 10 = 1. 7 mm) and a plastic “pinwheel” style medium (diameter = 2. 5 cm). A stoichiometric carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C:N:P) ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 is most commonly referenced in the drinking water industry as being ideal for microbial growth in distribution systems and biological filters. The nutrient amendment experiments studied the impact of amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 and 100 : 20 : 2, in a systematic and controlled manner. The monitoring and experimental program was conducted over 14 months to account for seasonal water quality and temperature effects. The results of this study have several implications for optimizing the design and operation of biological filters for drinking water treatment. The capping materials delayed terminal head loss by 10 - 40 hours, compared to the control GAC filter, and significantly reduced the rate of head loss accumulation at all temperature ranges without negatively impacting filter effluent turbidity or BOM removal. There were no significant differences in filter run time at cold water conditions between each of the filter configurations; however, both <b>capping</b> layers extended <b>filter</b> run time at warm water conditions. Replacing a relatively small layer of media with one that has a larger effective size can lead to more robust filter operation. At cold water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 of the GAC or EC <b>capped</b> <b>filters</b> did not yield significant differences in either traditional {{or biological}} filtration performance. The observed reduction of SRP and no reduction in NH 3 -N concentrations suggest that the system was phosphorus limited but not nitrogen limited; however, the performance of the filters was not nutrient limited. The maximum stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters was 100 : 0 : 10; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at cold water conditions. At warm water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of the GAC filter to either 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 did not yield any improvements in traditional or biological filtration performance. Reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended GAC filter suggests that it was both nitrogen and phosphorus limited, but not with respect to operational performance or BOM removal. Amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 of the EC <b>capped</b> <b>filter</b> led to a significant increase in its filter run time, while increasing the influent ratio to 100 : 20 : 2 improved both filter run time and rate of head loss accumulation; however, no improvements in BOM removal were observed. The long length of time required to observe improvements in filter performance at warm water conditions indicates that nutrient enhancement strategies may not be suitable for biological filters that operate in climates that experience short, or no periods of warm water conditions. Similar to the nutrient-amended GAC filter, reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended EC <b>capped</b> <b>filter</b> suggest that it was also nitrogen and phosphorus limited. The observed improvements in performance of the nutrient-amended EC <b>capped</b> <b>filters,</b> but not the GAC filter, suggests that nutrient enhancement strategies can be beneficial but at certain conditions only. The stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters ranged between 100 : 67. 3 : 6. 0 to 100 : 153. 3 : 7. 4; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at warm water conditions. Residual amounts of SRP measured at the effluent of the nutrient-amended filters at all temperature ranges and nutrient dosing rates, suggests that there is a maximum amount of phosphorus can be metabolized by the biological <b>filters.</b> The plastic <b>capped</b> <b>filter</b> outperformed or matched the performance of the nutrient-amended filters in terms of the rate of head loss accumulation and filter run time, without any loss in performance in terms of turbidity trends or DOC removal at cold or warm water conditions. This suggests that using capping materials can be a cost effective way to improve biological filtration hydraulic performance, and is operationally less complicated than a nutrient addition system. However, adding capping layers to existing filters may require modifications to their operation...|$|R

Except in the first study when CAP concentration was highest, lavageable total cells and macrophages decreased and neutrophils increased in WKY rats. SH rats demonstrated a consistent increase of lavage fluid γ -glutamyltransferase activity and plasma fibrinogen. Inspiratory and expiratory times increased in SH but not in WKY rats.

40|$|Introduction: Zoledronic acid (ZOL), a third {{generation}} amino-bisphosphonate (A-BP), is actually, {{the most potent}} inhibitor of the bone resorption, largely used in clinic {{for the treatment of}} bone diseases (i. e. bone metastases, osteoporosis and Paget's disease). Numerous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a powerful pro-apoptotic effect of ZOL in several tumor cell lines, suggesting an use of ZOL as anticancer drug. However, their short plasma half-life and the rapid accumulation of ZOL in bone, hamper the achievement of effective drug levels in tumors located outside the bone compartment. Purpose: To develop a nanosystem to use ZOL in the treatment of different extra-skeletal tumors, reducing the accumulation of drug in bone and increasing its concentration in peripheral tissues, e. g. in tumor sites. Methods: We developed pegylated self-assembly nanoparticles (NPs) composed of calcium phosphate NPs containing ZOL (NP CaPZ) coated with liposomes. Briefly, two aqueous solutions of CaCl 2 and Na 2 HPO 4, respectively, were mixed under magnetic stirring and the resulting dispersion was filtered through 0. 22 ??????m pore <b>filters</b> (<b>CaP</b> NPs). The dispersion was then mixed with an aqueous solution of ZOL, resulting in Ca 2 + / PO 43 - NPs containing ZOL (CaPZ NPs). In the following step, CaPZ NPs were mixed with pegylated cationic liposomes for 10 min at room temperature, obtaining the so-called PLCaPZ NPs. The NPs were characterized in terms of mean diameters and size distribution, morphology and ZOL complexation efficiency. The in vitro activity and cytotoxicity of NPs containing ZOL were evaluated in different tumor cell lines. Cellular proliferation studies in the presence of ZOL was investigated by MTT assay. Finally, the antitumor activity of PLCaPZ NP was evaluated in animal model of prostate cancer. Results: PLCaPZ NPs with a mean diameter of about 147 nm and a polydispersity index of about 0. 1 were obtained. Morphological analysis, performed by cFEG SEM, showed that the PLCaPZ NPs preparation consisted in an homogeneous and spherical particle dispersion. HPLC analysis of non-complexed ZOL showed an actual loading of 65 ???g of ZOL/mg lipids, corresponding to a complexation efficiency of about 70 %. In all cell lines, the NPs strengthened the growth inhibition induced by free ZOL, reaching a potentiation factor of 12 in breast carcinoma cell lines. Finally, a significant reduction in tumor growth and an increased survival following administration of PLCaPZ NP was observed in a model of prostate cancer. In addition, a complete remission of the tumor, after treatment of the animals with PLCaPZ NPs, was observed in a significant percentage of animals. In the same animal model, the administration of free ZOL was not effective in reducing significantly the growth of the tumors. Conclusions: New self-assembly NPs containing ZOL were successfully developed in our lab. The use of PLCaPZ NPs allowed to achieve a potent anti-tumor effect of ZOL, demonstrated in an animal model of prostate cancer. In the same animal model, tumor growth was unaffected when using free ZOL...|$|R

Most closed-path trace-gas analyzers for eddy-covariance measurements have large-volume, multi-pass absorption cells that necessitate high flow rates for ample frequency response, thus requiring high-power sample pumps. Other sampling system components, including rain <b>caps,</b> <b>filters,</b> dryers, and tubing can also degrade system frequency response. This field trial tested {{the performance of a}} closed-path eddy-covariance system for N 2 O flux measurements with improvements to use less power while maintaining the frequency response. The new system consists of a thermoelectrically cooled tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configured to measure both N 2 O and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The system features a relatively small, single- pass sample cell (200  ml) that provides good frequency response with a lower-powered pump (~  250  W). A new filterless intake removes particulates from the sample air stream with no additional mixing volume that could degrade frequency response. A single-tube dryer removes water vapor from the sample to avoid the need for density or spectroscopic corrections, while maintaining frequency response. This eddy-covariance system was collocated with a previous tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer model to compare N 2 O and CO 2 flux measurements for two full growing seasons (May 2015 to October 2016) in a fertilized cornfield in Southern Ontario, Canada. Both spectrometers were placed outdoors {{at the base of the}} sampling tower demonstrating ruggedness for a range of environmental conditions (minimum to maximum daily temperature range: − 26. 1 to 31. 6  °C). The new system rarely required maintenance.

Also, experience using EMPro is very beneficial for future RF/microwave/antenna engineers, as use of 3 D EM simulation is becoming a requirement for this field. 3 D EM simulators solve problems where using classical analysis techniques is impractical. Classical EM solutions to simple objects such as boxes, cylinders, and spheres, are widely known; but when the object is more complex, numerical approaches are preferred for their speed. Currently, Cal Poly does not use 3 D electromagnetic simulation in any of its courses. Targeted relevant courses include EE 335 / 375 : EM Fields 2 ̆ 6 Transmission Lines, EE 402 : EM Waves, EE 405 / 445 : High-Frequency Amplifier Design, EE 425 / 455 : Analog Filter Design, EE 502 : Microwave Engineering, and EE 533 : Antennas. As a starting point, EE 425 / 455 was targeted. In choosing which filters to investigate, simplicity and cost were the most important factors. For simplicity, transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode filters were chosen; also, using a trough design for these filters would allow for simple construction and access. Also, a circular waveguide filter was chosen as an alternative to the TEM filters, as the modes are either transverse electric or transverse magnetic. To lower costs, printed circuit board was used to construct the filters, along with brass tubing, semi-rigid coaxial cable, and copper plumbing caps. From these guidelines, three electronic bandpass filter experiments were investigated: a 1 GHz half-wave coaxial resonator filter, a 2 GHz copper end <b>cap</b> <b>filter,</b> and a tunable 1 GHz quarter-wave coaxial resonator filter. Electric and magnetic field coupling was used to excite the filters. They were then simulated using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations in Agilent EMPro. From the simulations, tradeoffs between insertion loss and bandwidth were observed. After, the filters were built and measured using a network analyzer. The quarter-wave filter was incorporated in Cal Poly’s EE 455 course during spring 2012. Students completed an EMPro tutorial, simulated the filters, and measured them using network analyzers. Student feedback was mixed, and modifications were made for future implementations...|$|R
