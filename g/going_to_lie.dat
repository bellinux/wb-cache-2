500|$|In a Guardian interview, Minaj {{said she}} competes with {{male and female}} rappers. In [...] "Moment 4 Life", she refers to herself as a [...] "king" [...] rather than a queen. Early in her career Minaj claimed to be bisexual, but {{eventually}} she said she just did that to get attention. [...] "I think girls are sexy, but I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> and say that I date girls." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Grant became {{troubled by the}} deaths {{of so many of}} his close friends, {{including}} Howard Hughes in 1976, Howard Hawks in 1977, Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979, Alfred Hitchcock in 1980, Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982, and David Niven in 1983. At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend: [...] "I'm absolutely pooped, and I'm so goddamned old...I'm going to quit all next year. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> in bed...I shall just close all doors, turn off the telephone, and enjoy my life". Kelly's death was the hardest hitting on Grant, as the death was unexpected, and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief. Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement, and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation.|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie,</b> it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the band's music is {{inspired}} mainly by vocalist Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration/release from prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. No songs by the band to date concern love because Radke stated that, [...] "...I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I've been through."

2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot and {{directed}} by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, [...] "We're still {{trying to work out}} the date for the next video with [...] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, {{there has to be some}} sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not I," [...] the man replied. [...] "Jim Walsh is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>lying</b> in bed, {{with the}} thought of two women in the hands of them murderous bush rangers. You might lend me a fresh horse, if you have got one. If not, I must try and pick one up at one of the stations, as we go along." ...|$|R
50|$|The Money {{was used}} for the {{construction}} of two buildings with four rooms each. The school site is actually a lot offered at a very low price by Mr. Candelario Patiño. The money from the sold lot was donated by the lot owner for the construction of the road <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the school. Later, an additional lot was donated by the same lot owner in exchange of the adjoining lot owned by Mrs. Paz Altavas where the road <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school <b>lies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie.</b> We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E

50|$|Barn Burning (set {{in about}} 1895) opens {{in a country}} store, which is {{doubling}} as a Justice of the Peace Court. A hungry boy named Sarty craves the meat and cheese in the store. He's afraid. His father, Abner Snopes, is in court, accused of burning down Mr. Harris's barn. Sarty is called up to testify against his father, and he knows he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> and say his father didn't burn the barn. The Justice and Mr. Harris realize they are putting the young boy in a bad position, and they let him off the hook. The Judge tells Mr. Snopes {{to leave the country}} and never come back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if the wind's ahead, {{you have}} to beat." [...] He drew two lines across the circle {{at right angles to}} each other and laid his finger at the end of one. [...] "Say we're here at north and the cove we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lies</b> about south. Well, you get your sheets in flat--same as we have them now--and you sail up this way, at this angle to the wind." [...] He ran a {{slanting}} line across the circle until it touched the rim. [...] "That brings you here; then you come round, and go off at the same angle on the opposite tack, which brings you right up to the cove. You can do it in two long tacks, or--and it's the same thing--in a lot of little ones, each at the same angle to the wind; but how many degrees there are in that angle and when you get there depends on how your sails are cut and how smart you are at steering her." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{shifted from}} one foot to another, and looked as if he wished himself out of my way.
