40|$|This master thesis {{project was}} carried out {{as a part of}} the {{chlorate}} research conducted at the Process RD&I department for bleaching chemicals at AkzoNobel Pulp and Performance Chemicals AB in Bohus. During the project already implemented filter cloths as well as new types of filters were studied and compared by experimental trials. The results were then examined in an attempt to evaluate existing filtration systems as well as investigate if there are other, better alternatives. The impurities found in a chlorate plant account for an efficiency loss in the process and a reduction of impurities would hence result in an energy reduction and a cleaner product. The trials were conducted at one of AkzoNobel’s chlorate plants. Six filters were studied and evaluated by measuring turbidity of the electrolyte and pressure over the filter during the experiments. Samples of the electrolyte were analyzed to obtain the metal content, and thereby the impurity content, of the electrolyte. The structures of the filters were studied by optical microscopy. The results from the trials show that all filter types except one, a needle <b>felt</b> <b>filter,</b> seem to be suitable for chlorate electrolyte filtration (including the filter types already used in the plants). The other filters all reach turbidity values below 0. 1 FNU immediately or within 90 minutes of filtration, which is considered good enough. The results from the metal content analysis show a similar trend where the metal concentrations decrease to levels below the detection limits immediately or within 90 minutes of filtration. Apart from the lab trials performed some measurements were made on the existing filtration equipment in the chlorate plant. The measurements show varying results, partly similar to those achieved during the lab filter trials but also results showing a higher turbidity value and metal content, indicating that full scale operation are more complicated than lab scale operation. The lab trial results obtained with the filter types already used in the plants show that lower impurity content is possible to achieve. However, this would require closer monitoring of the filtration systems in the plants. Apart from the filtration trials, an attempt to determine the sizes of the particles present in the electrolyte using laser diffraction was performed. However, too little was known of the chlorate electrolyte’s optical data for the measurements to be reliable. Further work is needed before a method for size determination of the particles in a chlorate electrolyte can be achieved. Also, an Optical Filtration Test was tried on the electrolyte but was not sensitive enough for utilization on electrolyte with low (below 1 FNU) turbidity values.   The project concluded that a switch to another filtration system is unmotivated, unless a change in the product requirements would occur. Since the impurities have proven to affect the efficiency of the process, it is recommended to make an effort into utilizing the filtration system to its full extent...|$|E

40|$|In the {{application}} of heterogeneous catalysts in liquid phase reactions, the rate of reaction as well as selectivity is often negatively influenced by mass transfer limitations in the stagnant liquid in the pores of the catalyst support. Internal mass transfer limitations can be reduced by maximizing the porosity and lowering the tortuosity of the catalyst support. Particles and layers consisting of carbon nanofibers are promising catalyst supports because of the combination large pore volume (0. 5 − 2 cm 3 /g) and extremely open morphology, on one hand, and significant high surface area (100 − 200 m 2 /g), on the other hand. This review deals with the preparation methods and application of the above-mentioned particles and thin layers, especially focusing on thin layers supported on structured materials like monoliths, metal foams, <b>felts,</b> <b>filters,</b> and fibers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Industrial dust {{emission}} {{is one of}} the main sources of fine particle especially for PM 2. 5 in atmosphere. Filter media is the key component for baghouse. In the paper, several normal needle <b>felt</b> <b>filters</b> and membrane filter are studied through experiments. The performances of filter such as resistance, capture efficiency for total particle and number counting efficiency for fine particle are tested. The experimental results show that the resistance of filter increase after aging, the resisitance increasing rate of membrane filter is the smallest; The efficiencies for total particles of normal filter are above 99. 9 % at clean state, and 99. 99 % at stable state after aging; Although the filters have high efficiency for total particle, but the number counting efficiency for 10 μm particle is 94 %- 99 %, and 52 %- 92 % for 2 μm particles. New filters for fine particles are needed...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} component of the Descending Bed Cell (also known as the Spouted Bed Cell) is the diaphragm used to separate the anode from the descending volume of metallic beads. In laboratory studies, semi-permeable materials (e. g. Daramic) have been used extensively, but these {{have proven to be}} too fragile for continuous, commercial type of operation. In order to find a more suitable material or group of materials, experimental studies were undertaken to determine both the electrical and mechanical resistances of various fabrics and composites. Materials included mechanically perforated plastic sheets of Teflon, PVC, Polypropylene, polycarbonate, woven filter clothes of Teflon, polypropylene and polyester and <b>felt</b> type <b>filter</b> materials of polypropylene and polyester. While all of these gave electrical resistance data only specific weaves of filter cloth had suitable capabilities in preventing the formation of short circuits.

X-ray microtomography is used to obtain the geometry of the conductive fibers inside the felts before and after these I-V tests.

40|$|Emulsified water {{separation}} from ultralow sulfur diesel {{fuel on board}} a vehicle is critical for modern diesel engine protection. However, such a separation poses great challenges to the commonly used coalescence filter media. These media must be designed {{to be able to}} cope with surfactants in the fuel typically by chemical surface modification. In this work, we examined several chemical coatings on glass slide and studied their response to water wetting in both air and diesel fuels containing monoolein, a designated fuel additive for SAE j 1488 test standard. It was found that one coating behaved dramatically differently than others. This coating is a fluorochemical (FC) with undisclosed chemistry, which leads to uncommon but favorable water wetting under fuel that further boosts coalescence separation of emulsified water with a commercial stainless steel <b>filter</b> <b>felt.</b> The feature and the chemistry of the coating were then revealed and rationalized with SEM, XPS, FTIR, NMR, GPC-LS and MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was also used to determine the characteristics of monoolein adsorption on the coatings. The results show that the FC coating chemistry is unique as it provides in one molecule a hard hydrophobic segment and a soft hydrophilic segment, both of which are desired for effective coalescence separation in light of easy capture of small droplets and easy release of gown droplets, even subject to the presence of surfactants in the fuel. Such a chemistry also results in surprisingly intensive adsorption of monoolein. Based on further observation of the relatively faster coalescene of two water droplets under static conditions in fuel on the FC coating surface, it is speculated that the strong adsorption forces the surfactant molecules to be pulled away from the fuel/water interface, thus triggering the subsequent coalescence. It is also postulated that the unique chemistry allows the adsorbed surfactant molecules to redistribute, leading to the very wetting phenomenon first time observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.
