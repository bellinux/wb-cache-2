5000|$|I mean can {{you imagine}} {{if there was a}} {{terrorist}} organization that took over the country on our northern border, which would be Canada, and they started shelling us in our northern cities and Minnesota and Bangor, Maine was being shelled, what do you <b>think</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> would do? ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{think he}} absolutely, {{positively}} {{knew that he}} was rubbing grease on him. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Georges</b> was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all. But that corner man was rubbing grease on him." [...] -Dana White, post fight at UFC 94.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2004, Robertson {{said that}} God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a [...] "blowout" [...] in November. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> {{is going to}} win in a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. [...] "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout {{election}} in 2004. It's shaping up that way." [...] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.|$|R
60|$|That {{seemed to}} satisfy them all. They couldn't {{get away from}} it. It {{seemed to me that}} from now on the thing was a walk-over. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> felt the same, for, when old Marshall asked him if he had had breakfast, he said he had not, went below, and pitched in as if he hadn't a care in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not. If I had to farm it, I'd feel scared; and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>George</b> is happy. It's hard to {{understand}} how Marston let it get into such a state." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Boon did on {{the whole}} enjoy the {{remarkable}} setting of his philosophical detachment very keenly; the monstrous fame of him that rolled about the world, that set out east and came back circumferentially from the west and beat again upon his doors. He laughed irresponsibly, spent the resulting money with an intelligent generosity, and talked of other things. [...] "It {{is the quality of}} life," [...] he said, and [...] "The people love to have it so." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes for his Greatest hits album, Alan wrote,"This {{is an old}} Roger Miller song I {{stumbled}} across. It's a real fun song with a Cajun feel. I've always been {{a big fan of}} Roger's and {{when it came time to}} record a couple of new songs for this greatest hits, I couldn't resist. After I recorded it, we found out that George Jones is a co-writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> had even forgotten he'd written it. I'm proud to have the chance to record a song written by two of my favorites." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's puzzling to me. These things {{often are}} to outsiders. Still, Clarence is a {{handsome}} man, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> {{was in favor}} of the match, which would count with her. Then, in a way, she was always fond of Clarence, and now that she has the money and he's far from prospering on the land, the idea that she could set him firmly on his feet by sharing her possessions with him may prove tempting. It's very much {{the sort of thing that}} would appeal to her." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, in {{the wake}} of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, Shea used his show as a {{platform}} to speak out against the attempts to increase censorship on broadcasting. [...] "I think this is totally from the White House," [...] said Shea. [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> is trying to pander to the extreme Christian Coalition he thinks will back him in this election. I hope it's a huge failure and he gets kicked out of the White House." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes! Much {{good that}} does now!" [...] Being got into bed, with the sheet {{smoothed}} under her chin, she said, with {{the effect of}} drawing a strictly logical conclusion from the premises, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Maynard {{would want to be}} with his family!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> would really, on the whole, {{prefer to}} take your place," [...] said Mr. Wilton, turning to George.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unmarried {{females are}} {{considered}} cyphers too, here, provided there be {{enough of them}} with a good respectable digit at their head. I assure you no one quarrels with the cyphers under such circumstances. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Sir <b>George</b> Templemore, a town like this must {{be something of a}} paradox to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padm√© and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that a lot of}} that is passed on from parent to child. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping into and out of stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|R
5000|$|McCartney {{could not}} recall if he {{appeared}} on the recording: [...] "I think we had a barney or something and I said, 'Oh, fuck you!,' and they said, 'Well, we'll do it.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> played bass." [...] In his 2012 book on the making of Revolver, author Robert Rodriguez highlights McCartney's walkout as one of [...] "a handful of unsolved Beatles mysteries". When identifying the probable causes for McCartney's uncharacteristic behaviour, Rodriguez cites later comments made by Lennon: specifically that Lennon appreciated Harrison's tendency to [...] "take it as-is" [...] whereas McCartney often took a musical arrangement in a direction he himself preferred; and that, given Lennon and Harrison's habit of teasing their bandmate over his refusal to take LSD, McCartney possibly felt alienated by the song's subject matter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} thought to be the second single from The Recession, but was later {{replaced}} by [...] "Vacation" [...] and was pushed to being the third single. In the song, Young Jeezy talks about the recession America is going through and how he <b>thinks</b> president <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> is punishing America, and this song also talks about the late 2000s recession.|$|R
6000|$|George meanwhile, with finely {{appointed}} reinforcements, {{was in full}} {{march to}} join Ludwig; but the sad news of Mohacz met him: he withdrew, as soon as might be, to his own territory, and quitted Hungarian politics. This, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was <b>George's</b> third and last trial of war. He by no means delighted in that art, or had cultivated it like Casimir {{and some of his}} brothers.-- ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{during the}} fight as St-Pierre's corner-men were spotted rubbing St-Pierre's back immediately after applying Vaseline to his face. Members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) {{came into the}} octagon and wiped St-Pierre's torso down. Penn later sent a formal request to the NSAC, asking them to investigate. Despite all of the complaints by the Penn camp, the NSAC ruled {{that there was no}} infraction. This incident was famously coined by Penn fans as the [...] "Greasegate" [...] and remains as one of the biggest controversial moments in UFC history. [...] "I think he absolutely, positively knew that he was rubbing grease on him. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Georges</b> was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all. But that corner man was rubbing grease on him." [...] -Dana White, post fight at UFC 94.|$|R
6000|$|... 'With delight,' he answered. 'I am used, you know, to walks before breakfast. <b>George,</b> <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>George</b> can do it, though. George {{likes his}} comforts; he {{is a regular}} John Bull. He was always calling for tea {{when we were in}} Turkey!' ...|$|R
2500|$|The fight ended {{after the}} fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, {{requested}} that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted {{that he could not}} recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because [...] "I was probably borderline knocked out or something." [...] During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp. Dana White said it was unfortunate GSP's dominant win was overshadowed by the cornerman controversy. [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he got greased? Yeah, I do," [...] White told The Canadian Press prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. [...] "Absolutely, 100 per cent, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that that guy was rubbing grease on him. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Georges</b> was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now I think,' said Venetia, 'of all {{the persons}} I know, {{there is no}} one so {{qualified}} for domestic happiness as yourself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> your wife, <b>George,</b> would be a very fortunate woman, and I only wish I had a sister, that you might marry her.' ...|$|R

Well, {{if you will}} not love Mr. Home for his politics, there is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> another reason, <b>George,</b> why you should like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean that}}, Amelia?" [...] William said sadly. [...] "You don't mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against a whole life's devotion? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>George's</b> memory {{has not been}} injured by {{the way in which}} I have dealt with it, and if we are come to bandying reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother of his son.

5000|$|George's [...] "Something" [...] {{was out of}} left field.

Again, from my side, I was trying to contribute the best I could, but maybe {{it was his turn to}} tell me I was too busy. - Paul McCartney, 2000 The Beatles undertook the recording of Abbey Road with a sense of discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 partly as a result of McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else ... It was a tremendous work - and so simple." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite likely," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Dodge innocently, {{though the}} two other visiters, Eve and Mademoiselle Viefville, permitted slight muscular movements about the lips to be seen: [...] "Sir George is quite an original in his way. We have few originals in {{our part of the}} country, you know, Mr. John Effingham; for to say the truth, it is rather unpopular to differ from the neighbourhood, in this or any other respect. Yes, sir, the people will rule, and ought to rule. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Sir <b>George</b> may get along well enough as a stranger, for it is not quite as unpopular in a stranger to be original, as in a native. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you will agree with me, sir, in believing it excessively presuming in an American to pretend to be different from his fellow-citizens." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Rubenstein (a {{founder of}} the Carlyle Group) {{described}} that time to a convention of pension managers in Los Angeles last year, recalling that Republican fund raiser, Fred Malek approached him and said, [...] "There {{is a guy who}} would like to be on the board. He's kind of down on his luck a bit. Needs a job[...] [...] [...] Needs some board positions." [...] Though Rubenstein didn't <b>think</b> <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush,</b> then in his mid-40s, [...] "added much value," [...] he put him on the Caterair board. [...] "Came to all the meetings," [...] Rubenstein told the conventioneers. [...] "Told a lot of jokes. Not that many clean ones. And after a while I kind of said to him, after about three years: You know, I'm not sure this is really for you. Maybe you should do something else. Because <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> you're adding that much value to the board. You don't know that much about the company." [...] He said: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm getting out of this business anyway. And I don't really like it that much. So I'm probably going to resign from the board."

60|$|Such was {{the pair}} who ruled {{in the old}} Silverado Hotel, among the windy trees, on the {{mountain}} shoulder overlooking the whole length of Napa Valley, as the man aloft looks down on the ship's deck. There they kept house, with sundry horses and fowls, and a family of sons, Daniel Webster, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Washington, among the number. Nor did they want visitors. An old gentleman, of singular stolidity, and called Breedlove--I think he had crossed the plains in the same caravan with Rufe--housed with them for awhile during our stay; and they had besides a permanent lodger, {{in the form of}} Mrs. Hanson's brother, Irvine Lovelands. I spell Irvine by guess; for I could get no information on the subject, just as I could never find out, in spite of many inquiries, whether or not Rufe was a contraction for Rufus. They were all cheerfully at sea about their names in that generation. And this is surely the more notable where the names are all so strange, and even the family names appear to have been coined. At one time, at least, the ancestors of all these Alvins and Alvas, Loveinas, Lovelands, and Breedloves, must have taken serious council and found a certain poetry in these denominations; that must have been, then, their form of literature. But still times change; and their next descendants, the George Washingtons and Daniel Websters, will at least be clear upon the point. And anyway, and however his name should be spelt, this Irvine Lovelands was the most unmitigated Caliban I ever knew.|$|R

And as this volume will, perhaps, {{fall into the hands}} of many parents as well as children, I will here remark that a great many good-hearted and excellent boys fall into the same difficulty from precisely the same cause; namely, that they have not adequate employment for their mental and physical powers, which are growing and strengthening every day, and are hungering and thirsting for the means and opportunities of expending their energies.|$|R

6000|$|Washington, Monday forenoon, May 23, '64. DEAR BROTHER JEFF--I {{received}} {{your letter}} yesterday. I too had {{got a few}} lines from George, dated on the field, 16th. He said he had also just written to mother. I cannot make out there has been any fighting since in which the 9th Corps has been engaged. I do hope mother will not get despondent and so unhappy. I suppose it is idle to say <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>George's</b> chances are very good for {{coming out of this}} campaign safe, yet at present it seems to me so--but it is indeed idle to say so, for no one can tell what a day may bring forth. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that should it come, when it must be, to fall in battle, one's anguish over a son or brother killed would be tempered with much to take the edge off. I can honestly say it has no terrors for me, if I had to be hit in battle, as far as I myself am concerned. It would be a noble and manly death and in the best cause. Then one finds, as I have the past year, that our feelings and imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter. Of the many I have seen die, or known of, the past year, I have not seen or heard of one who met death with any terror. Yesterday afternoon I spent {{a good part of the}} afternoon with a young man of 17, named Charles Cutter, of Lawrence city, Mass., 1st Mass. heavy artillery, battery M. He was brought in to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen. Well, I thought to myself as I sat looking at him, it ought to be a relief to his folks after all, if they could see how little he suffered. He lay very placid in a half lethargy with his eyes closed. It was very warm, and I sat a long while fanning him and wiping the sweat. At length he opened his eyes quite wide and clear and looked inquiringly around. I said, [...] "What is it, my dear? do you want anything?" [...] He said quietly, with a good natured smile, [...] "O nothing; I was only looking around to see who was with me." [...] His mind was somewhat wandering, yet he lay so peaceful, in his dying condition. He seemed to be a real New England country boy, so good natured, with a pleasant homely way, and quite a fine looking boy. Without any doubt he died in course of night.|$|R
