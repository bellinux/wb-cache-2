50|$|Phyllophaga is a {{very large}} genus (more than 260 species) of New World scarab beetles in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May beetles, June bugs, and <b>June</b> <b>beetles.</b> They range in size from 12 to 35 mm and are blackish or reddish-brown in colour, without prominent markings, and often rather hairy ventrally. These beetles are nocturnal, coming to lights in great numbers.|$|E
50|$|Cotinis nitida, {{commonly}} known as the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> <b>June</b> bug or <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a beetle of the family Scarabaeidae. It is found in the eastern United States, where it is most abundant in the south. It is sometimes confused with the related southwestern species figeater beetle Cotinis mutabilis, which is less destructive.|$|R

50|$|Cotinis mutabilis, {{also known}} as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), {{is a member of the}} scarab beetle family. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US; however, they are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as their eastern cousins.|$|E
5000|$|Based on surveys {{conducted}} {{to assess the}} species' presence, {{both male and female}} Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> emerge from underground burrows sometime between late March and early June, with abundance peaks generally occurring in April and May. Females are always observed on the ground and are considered flightless. [...] stated that [...] "Female Dinacoma are very rare in collections. Females display an accentuated sexual dimorphism characterized by an enlarged abdomen, reduced legs and antennae, and metathoracic wing reduction and venation. These characters are likely adaptations to flightlessness and a fossorial biology." [...] During the active flight season, males emerge from the ground and begin flying near dusk. Males are reported to fly back and forth or crawl on the ground where a female beetle has been detected. [...] theorized that after emergence, females remain on the ground and release pheromones to attract flying males. After mating, females return to their burrows or dig a new burrow and deposit eggs. Excavations of adult emergence burrows revealed pupal exuviae (casings) at depths ranging from approximately 4 to 6 in (10 to 16 cm).|$|E
50|$|C. mutabilis {{is often}} {{confused}} with the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cotinis nitida). Both {{are members of the}} flower beetle subfamily (Cetoniinae), and are similar in appearance, but the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> is smaller, and its range is in the eastern United States.

5000|$|Ithonidae are {{typically}} medium to large-sized neuropterans. P. S. Welch conducted research in 1914 on [...] "Polystoechotidae" [...] larvae {{resulting in the}} conclusion that the larvae were carnivorous. [...] The first instar stage for modern larvae is a carabaeiform grub. [...] Robert J. Tillyard first described the larvae of Ithone fusca in 1922, noting the unusual grub-like shape, similar to fruit-chafers and <b>June</b> <b>beetles,</b> as unique among Neuroptera species. The odd larval shape of Ithionidae larvae has been, and continues to be, a subject of interest among entomologists. Tillyard suggested the larvae to be carnivorous, preying upon Scarabaeidae larvae, attacking with the large mandibles and [...] "sucking them dry". [...] Further study by Faulkner in 1990 has shown the immature Ithonidae to be phytophagous, a condition unique among neuropterans. [...] The genus Rapisma was formerly considered distinct from the Ithonidae and placed in the monotypic family Rapismatidae. Recent studies have favored inclusion into Ithonidae, while this is not always followed, it has been supported by recent phylogenetic work. [...] Mass emergences have been recorded from the genera Oliarces and Ithone, usually associated with seasonal rains.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{locomotion}} response of airborne, ambulatory and aquatic insects to thermal stimulation. A {{finite element model}} has been developed to predict the variation of insect–stimulator interface temperature with input power. Piezothermal stimulators have been fabricated from lead zirconate titanate (PZT) using a batch mode micro ultrasonic machining process. Typical sizes range from 200 µm to 3. 2 mm. For PZT stimulators, the temperature and thermal efficiency reach the maximum value around the resonance frequency which is typically {{in the range of}} 650 kHz to 47 MHz. Experiments have been conducted on green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJBs), Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDBs) in order to show the versatility of the proposed technique. The stimulators have been implanted near the antennae of the GJBs and {{on either side of the}} thorax of the Madagascar hissing roaches and GDBs, respectively. In all cases, the insects move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. The left and right turns are statistically similar. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 78. 7 %, 92. 8 % and 61. 6 % in GJBs, roaches and GDBs, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 13. 7 °– 16. 2 ° on GJBs, 30 °– 45 ° on the roaches and 30 °– 50 ° on GDBs. The corresponding average input power is 360, 330 and 100 mW for GJBs, roach and GDBs, respectively. Scaling limits of the PZT stimulators for operating these stimulators are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of bulk micromachined {{piezoelectric}} transducers for ultrasonic heat generation. The work includes basic studies of the phenomenon, the development of simulation models, the design and fabrication of practical devices and interface circuits. The technology is demonstrated in two application contexts: cauterization with a biopsy needle, and stimulation of insect locomotion. Simulations based on three-dimensional finite element models, indicate that circular disc-shaped elements provide superior steady-state temperature rise for a given cross-sectional area, volume of the PZT element, and drive voltage. The heating is greatest at the frequency of maximum electromechanical conductance. The thermal efficiency is maximized at frequency of maximum electromechanical impedance. Stacked PZT heaters provide 3. 5 x the temperature rise and 3 x greater efficiency than single elements. A biopsy needle with an embedded array of four piezoceramic microheaters of 200 µm diameter and 70 - 80 µm thickness has been fabricated. The PZT- 5 A heaters generate the target temperature rise of 33 ˚C at the tissue-needle interface for an input power of < 325 mW and a drive voltage of < 17 VRMS when inserted into porcine tissue. The extent of tissue cauterization is < 1. 25 mm beyond {{the perimeter of the}} needle. Cauterization of porcine tissue sample results in a decrease of 600 kHz in the resonance frequency and 900 ohms in the peak impedance magnitude, allowing the extent of cauterization to be monitored easily. Interface circuits for measurement of resonance frequency shift due to cauterization and for actuation of PZT heaters are also described. Experiments have been conducted using piezothermal stimulators implanted near antennae of green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJB), and {{on either side of the}} thorax of Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDB) to show the feasibility of locomotion control using microthermal stimulation. Thermal stimulation causes the insects to move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 80 %, 93. 5 % and 68 % in GJB, roaches and GDB, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 15 ˚- 18 ˚ on GJB, 30 ˚- 45 ˚ on the roaches and 15 ˚- 60 ˚ on GDB. The corresponding average input power is 360 mW, 330 mW and 100 mW for GJB, roach, and GDB, respectively...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Texas school district personnel were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire to determine the status of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs and the efficacy of conventional pest control practices. Of the 517 survey participants, 12. 4 % had procedures for IPM, and almost 28 % had official procedures for pesticide use (N= 1047). Over 75 % of Texas school districts contracted their general pest control activities to professionally licensed pest control firms. Specialty services such as termite control were contracted with licensed companies for almost 90 % of Texas districts. The principle in-house pest control practices (77. 3 %) were for weed control. A majority of districts (56. 3 %) were considered small (< three schools per district), and most (67. 8 %) budget $ 5000 or less for all pest control services. Present pest control practices were considered to be moderately to extremely effective by 87. 4 % of responding districts. The most important indoor pests, reported by the questionnaire responses, were cockroaches, ants, rodents, termites and head lice. Outdoor pests included fire ants (Solenopsis spp.), stinging (bees, wasps and hornets), flying (mosquitoes and gnats) and turfgrass insects (<b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> and mole crickets) and weeds. Control measures used by schools were categorized as non-chemical and chemical. Non-chemical pest control measures (mechanical and cultural controls) were used by at least 42 % of Texas schools. Results of the survey indicated that many different pesticides were used by school systems. When asked about specific pests and control measures, respondents frequently indicated that either the pest was not a problem or no chemicals were used for-their control. The most commonly selected insecticides by school district personnel were Dursban [chlorpyrifos], diazinon, and pyrethr-um products. Ten schools from different districts, representing all Texas regions and demographics, were selected for site visits and sticky trap sampling. The sampling program indicated that the most frequently encountered indoor pests, in order of importance, were German cockroaches [Blattella gerinanica (Linnaeus) ], Pharaoh [Monomotium pharaonis (L.) ] or crazy ants [Paratrechina longicomis (Latreille) ], followed by house crickets [Acheta domesticus (L.) ] and American cockroaches [Periplaneta atneiicana (L.) ]. High incidences of insects were detected in areas where food was stored and processed, such as food preparation equipment, vending machines, ovens and stoves...|$|E
40|$|Processing {{techniques}} for red wines {{and their potential}} health benefits have intensively been investigated, however, information relevant to the grape and wine industry in Texas is less frequently available. The overall objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} reduction of 3 -alkyl- 2 -methoxypyrazines that can affect the quality of Texas wines and to study the health benefits of Texas wines. The methods used include SPME-GC-MS and molecular bioassays. The first objective was to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory potential effect of red wine polyphenols from Black Spanish wine (Vitis aestivalis hybrid) in colonic human fibroblast cells. Results show that an extract prepared from Black Spanish wine decreased gene expression and activation of NF-kB transcription factor and target proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Induction of microRNA- 126 (miR- 126) by wine extract was found {{to be one of the}} underlying molecular mechanism by which wine extract decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM- 1) and inflammation in colon cells. These mechanisms may be relevant to the prevention of iv inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may increase the risk for colon cancer. The second objective was to investigate the role of the green june beetle (GJB) as exogenous source of MPs other than the multicolored Asian Lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis). Over the last decade, the green june beetle has been suspected to be a source of MPs based on intermittent reports from Texas growers of an atypical aroma and flavor reminiscent of crushed green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJB). Specifically the North region of Texas seems affected. Results demonstrated GJB as source of 3 -isopropyl- 2 - methoxypyrazine, where one GJB could elevate MPs above sensory perceptible levels in 4. 3 gallons of wine. The incorporation of GJB to the winemaking process may contribute negatively to the sensory properties of Texas wines and therefore should be strictly controlled. The third objective was to explore the potential effect of micro-oxygenation treatment and accelerated aging techniques relevant for the state of Texas in the reduction of 3 -Isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP), and 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) levels as determined by SPME-GC-MS. Results show that MPs were not affected by MOX or oak interaction. Although the data suggest that MOX and oak exposure do not directly affect MPs concentration. The fourth research objective was to explore the potential effect of three commercial available yeast strains, BM 45, K 1, and D 80, on MPs levels in Black Spanish wines. Black Spanish wines were fermented with MB 45 strain resulted in the highest amount of MPs. Conversely K 1 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP levels in comparison with the control. An increase in IBMP was not expected. However it has been demonstrated that amino acids valine and leucine are MPs precursors. If Vitis v aestivalis hybrid grapes contained a similar methyltransferase enzyme found in Vitis vinifera grapes and S. cerevisiae contained similar IPMP biosynthesis pathway found in Pseudomonas perolens BM 45 may have led to the increased IBMP observed in the fermentation. In addition we evaluated MPs levels of wines fermented over 20 days with a chemical defined grape juice medium containing a concentration of yeast available nitrogen of 200 mg N/L. Data suggest that wines fermented with BM 45 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP but K 1 yeast did not show any effect in comparison with the control. In addition MPs were evaluated in the yeast mannoproteins fraction. Results show the presence of IBMP in low concentration below the method detection limit. This data demonstrate for the first time that yeast mannoproteins binds IBMP. to evidence for interactions between mannoproteins secreted by the D 80 yeast strain and IBMP. This work will provide valuable information regarding the potential health benefits of Vitis aestivalis hybrid grapes and reduction of MPs and thus improving the quality of Texas wine...|$|E
