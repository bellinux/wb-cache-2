25|$|This social trauma made itself {{manifest}} {{in many different}} ways. Some people were revolted by nationalism and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more internationalist world through {{organizations such as the}} League of Nations. Pacifism became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and cynicism became pronounced. Nihilism grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded {{the end of the world}} as they <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>it,</b> including the collapse of capitalism and imperialism. Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.|$|E
25|$|The day the Russian Revolution of February 1917 {{began in}} Saint Petersburg, Rachmaninoff {{performed}} a piano recital in Moscow in aid of wounded Russian {{soldiers who had}} fought in the war. He supported the political changes and donated his fee to charity. Following a break {{with his family in}} the more peaceful Simeiz, Crimea in August, Rachmaninoff performed at a concert the following month at Yalta. It was his final performance in Russia, before events surrounding the Revolution of October 1917 marked the end of Russia as the composer <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>it.</b> As a member of the Russian bourgeoisie, he did not support Bolshevism, neither did his father manage {{to keep up with the}} aristocratic circles he had been born into, so that in due course came the humiliation of selling the family estate; then Rachmaninoff’s own estate, Ivanovka, was seized by the Leninist regime in 1917. At the height of such turmoil, Rachmaninoff received an offer to perform ten piano recitals across the peaceful Scandinavia, which he used as an excuse to quickly obtain permits for his family to leave the country. On 22 December 1917, they left on an open sled, travelling north through Finland and on to Helsinki with some money, a few notebooks with sketches of compositions, and two orchestral scores; the first Act of his unfinished opera Monna Vanna and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Golden Cockerel. They reached safety in Stockholm, Sweden and, in early 1918, settled in Copenhagen, Denmark where Rachmaninoff worked as a concert pianist, practising exhaustively to improve his technique and learning further compositions to play. The tour lasted from February to July 1918.|$|E

500|$|Reacting to {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to Odd Girl Out that she was shocked {{to find out that}} her characters were not only remembered but that they were archetypes among the lesbian community. The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and LGBT studies college courses. Bannon often admits to being surprised by this, explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing Odd Girl Out: [...] "If I <b>had</b> <b>known,</b> <b>it</b> might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that would have been so cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next."

2500|$|The writ of coram nobis is a non-statutory, {{common law}} remedy whose origins trace {{back to an}} era in England in which appeals and new trial motions were unknown. Far from being of {{constitutional}} origin, the proceeding designated [...] "coram nobis" [...] was contrived by the courts at an early epoch {{in the growth of}} common law procedure to provide a corrective remedy because of the absence at that time of the right to move for a new trial and the right of appeal from the judgment. The grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of coram nobis are narrower than on habeas corpus. [...] The writ's purpose is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court.|$|E
