30|$|Remotely sensed data, in general, more {{accurately}} depict post-fire changes in overstory tree canopy than understory or forest floor changes (Hudak et al. 2007), and fire <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil surface appear to vary at finer scales than fire <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> overstory. Thus, even within areas with relatively uniform fire <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> overstory (e.g., across a patch we classified as moderate severity) the highly variable post-fire soil surface likely {{contributes to the}} high variation in vegetation response. Similarly, Turner et al. (1994) found that smaller patches, those less than 1, 250 ha in area, were often quite heterogeneous in fire <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil surface. There is also high variability in vegetation present before the burn, which would have affected post-fire vegetation response.|$|R
