50|$|Informal {{economic}} activity accounts for between 25 and 40 percent of Gross National Income. Meaning, some informal income {{is not really}} accounted for in the aggregate production figures. Informal {{economic activity}} really <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed,</b> and {{perhaps one of the}} best ways to do so is to study the roots of such activity and phenomenon, namely the loopholes of the legal system and mercantilist thought. In the legal system, there always seems to be injustice and in such a system, there would always be favored entities and forgotten entities. The current legal system also appears to be full of loopholes which give rise to many illegitimate opportunity structures, giving people some chance to actually get around the legal system. Thus, it would definitely be important to constitute reforms in the legal system to ensure fair play in the economy. If the atmosphere of fair play can be fostered and taken care of, then it is likely that informal players would go back to the formal economy.|$|E

[...] McCarthy, a columnist for the National Review, describes Gorka’s Defeating Jihad as a good [...] "primer on the Islamic doctrinal and scholarly roots of jihadist terror," [...] particularly [...] "takfiri jihad" [...] targeting fellow Muslims.
