25|$|Further {{causes of}} {{groundwater}} pollution are chemical spills from commercial or industrial operations, chemical spills occurring during transport (e.g. spillage of diesel fuels), illegal waste dumping, infiltration from urban runoff or mining operations, road salts, de-icing chemicals from airports and even atmospheric contaminants since groundwater {{is part of}} the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{responses of}} the surface energy budgets and <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycles</b> of 19 atmospheric general circulation models to an imposed, globally uniform sea surface temperature perturbation of 4 K. The {{responses of the}} simulated surface energy budgets are extremely diverse and are {{closely linked to the}} responses of the simulated <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The response of the net surface energy flux is not controlled by cloud effects; instead, it is determined primarily by the response of the latent heat flux. The prescribed warming of the oceans leads to major increases in the atmospheric water vapor content and the rates of evaporation and precipitation. The increased water vapor amount drastically increases the downwelling infrared radiation at the Earth's surface, but the amount of the change varies dramatically from one model to another. 1...|$|R
25|$|Hydro{{meteorology}} is {{the branch}} of meteorology that deals with the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle,</b> the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas {{with the potential for}} flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.|$|E
25|$|The valleys {{typically}} {{have many features}} that on Earth are commonly (though not exclusively) associated with groundwater sapping - for instance, amphitheater-like headwalls, constant valley width downstream, flat or U-shaped floors and steep walls. However, without some recharge mechanism for the putative aquifers producing this seepage, i.e., a <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle</b> of some kind, it is extremely unlikely that enough water could seep to cut all of the valleys formed in the Noachian. In spite of this, this basic model may remain useful in understanding the more limited valleys formed later in the Hesperian and Amazonian.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle</b> in the Ganges basin {{is governed}} by the Southwest Monsoon. About 84% of the total {{rainfall}} occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, streamflow in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at Hardinge Bridge. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region. The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and floods. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought {{during the dry season}} and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle,</b> water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E
25|$|While in the {{stratosphere}} (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present {{in much of the}} rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle</b> as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic Ocean. Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic. Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades. Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000meters south of the Gulf Stream due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, the isosurface deepens and reaches the floor of the abyssal plain which {{is directly related to the}} ventilation of the ocean floor over 10 to 20 year time-scales.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of aquatic macrophytes in intermittent rivers is generally {{related to the}} characteristics of the resistance and resilience of plants to hydrologic disturbances of flood and drought. In the semi-arid region of Brazil, intermittent rivers and streams are affected by disturbances with variable intensity, frequency, and duration throughout their <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The aim of the present study is to determine the occurrence and variation of biomass of aquatic macrophyte species in two intermittent rivers of distinct hydrologic regimes. Their dynamics were determined with respect to resistance and resilience responses of macrophytes to flood and drought events by estimating the variation of biomass and productivity throughout two <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycles.</b> Twenty-one visits were undertaken in the rewetting, drying, and drought phases in a permanent puddle in the Avelós stream and two temporary puddles in the Taperoá river, state of Paraíba, Northeast Brazil. The sampling was carried out by using the square method. Floods of different magnitudes occurred during the present study in the river and in the stream. The results showed that floods and droughts are determining factors in the occurrence of macrophytes and in the structure of their aquatic communities. The species richness of the aquatic macrophyte communities was lower in the puddles of the river and stream subject to flood events, when compared to areas where the run...|$|R

2500|$|The US EPA has {{acknowledged}} that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, {{have been used as}} gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF).

[...] Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they're mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
