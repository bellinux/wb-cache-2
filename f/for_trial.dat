40|$|Background—Prior work {{indicates}} that therapeutic trials funded by for-profit organizations {{are more likely}} to report positive findings than trials funded by not-for-profit organizations. What impact, if any, funding source has on subsequent dissemination of trial data is uncertain. To address this issue, we used the number of citations per publication per year to assess differences in trial dissemination according to funding source. Methods and Results—We assessed 303 consecutive superiority trials of cardiovascular medicine published between January 1, 2000, and July 30, 2005, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine. The primary outcome measure was the number of citations per publication per year up to December 31, 2006. Overall, the median number of citations per publication per year was 46 <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded exclusively by for-profit organizations, 37 <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> jointly funded, and 29 <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded by not-for-profit organizations (P 0. 0007). Higher citation rates <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded by for-profit organizations were consistently observed in analyses stratified by journal and various trial design features and were most striking when the new intervention was favored over the standard of care; in this subgroup, the median number of citations per publication per year was 52 <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded by for-profit organizations compared with 25 <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded by not-for-profit organizations (P 0. 0006). In marked contrast, in analyses limited to trials in which the new intervention was significantly worse than the standard of care, an inverse pattern was observed with fewer citations per publication per year <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> funded by for-profi...|$|R

5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a {{commission}} to investigate the case.

5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone.

5|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} used by NSB {{was a single}} Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more cost-efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit <b>for</b> <b>trial.</b> The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> in Norway and Sweden.

5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent <b>for</b> <b>trial,</b> but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes <b>for</b> <b>trial,</b> where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, {{it was left}} demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued the fleeing patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so the army had to quickly leave those provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to Buenos Aires. Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to Buenos Aires <b>for</b> <b>trial.</b> However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon as he left Buenos Aires, and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E

5|$|As Japanese {{shelling}} intensifies in Burma, Chandrasekaran and Gnanasekaran {{decide to}} return to India. Chandrasekaran, accompanied by Saraswati, reaches Tiruchi safely and becomes a judge, but Gnanasekaran is lost in the journey and loses a leg in the shelling before arriving in India. He begs for a living, forms an association for beggars and tries to reform them. Kalyani reaches Chandrasekaran's palatial house seeking food, but Chandrasekaran throws her out without recognising her. She later arrives at a temple seeking help, but the pujari (priest) also tries to molest her. Frustrated with life and unable to feed her child, Kalyani throws it into a river and attempts suicide, but is soon arrested for killing the child and brought <b>for</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse Réunion were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary jury masts were fitted to Heureuse Réunion for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> at Port Royal. Heureuse Réunion was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa <b>for</b> <b>trial,</b> followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E

He was to appear <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> at the next assizes. Richard Cooper the elder and Richard Cooper the younger were also bound over to the next assizes. Father and son, William Beamiss the elder and the younger, were then brought in and charged with assaulting and {{stealing}} from Robert Cheesewright the younger, of Littleport, in the Isle of Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Mr Burrough summed up and the jury gave their guilty verdict to both prisoners shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame.
