5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1965 Britain {{engaged in}} covert {{operations}} {{in support of}} Royalist forces fighting the Egyptian backed Republican regime that had seized power in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 1962. Until the end of 1965, the British presence in Aden was considered of high interest to the United Kingdom, linked to the realization of oil assets in the Middle East. The means to secure this presence however involved a bitter argument within the British government, with no coherency <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making on the Yemen issue. The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the Federation of South Arabia, which complicated British relations with many global and regional players, {{as well as with}} the rulers of South Arabia themselves. The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization (BMO), which was capable to stage its own covert operations, independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia. The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Doctors should involve their {{patients}} <b>in</b> making <b>decisions</b> about their care. We studied patients {{with heart disease}} to assess if shared decision-making occurs and to study factors that predict patients' choices or influence cardiologists' behaviour. METHODS: 85 patients attending for arteriography were assessed to elicit preferred involvement in decision-making, perception of involvement, and confidence <b>in</b> the <b>decision.</b> RESULTS: 40 % of patients wished to be involved <b>in</b> <b>decisions.</b> Preferences were unrelated to demographic factors. Cardiologists involved patients more <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> concerning severe disease (p= 0. 056). Involvement varied between cardiologists (p= 0. 001). The mean duration of consultations was 5. 5 min. Patients' confidence <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> correlated with duration (p= 0. 001), explicit reference to a decision {{that needed to be}} made (p= 0. 0026), and perceived, but not observed, involvement in decision-making (p= 0. 05). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the complexity of doctor-patient communication. Irrespective of preferences for involvement, patients were more confident <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> which they perceived more involvement or which were the products of longer consultations. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients' confidence <b>in</b> clinical <b>decisions</b> can be increased by increasing consultation length and increasing their perception of involvement. Patients perceive more involvement <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> when doctors specifically identify the need for treatment <b>decisions</b> early <b>in</b> the consultation...|$|R

5|$|Ralph {{suffered}} a stroke on 11 July 1119 as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly. He was still involved <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making and, in 1120, he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland's suggestion that Eadmer become the next Bishop of St Andrew's. Ralph {{was one of the}} lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121. He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king's new marriage, over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead. Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage. Ralph died on 20 October 1122, at Canterbury. He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122. His nephew, John, was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury. After Ralph's death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

30|$|In {{most of the}} {{satisfaction}} scales developed for the ICU, participation in care, discussions, and decisions is listed among the factors that increase family satisfaction [32]-[34]. In Canada, where surrogates make decisions for the patients they represent, surrogate satisfaction with the decision-making process was found to increase {{with the quality of}} the information received [32]. On both sides of the Atlantic, participation of families <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> is associated with greater satisfaction [32],[33],[35]-[37]. When 8, 000 residents of France were surveyed, 90 % of responses indicated a desire to have family members share <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> about their care should they require ICU admission [38]. In France and in other countries, the overwhelming majority of healthcare providers are willing to have families share <b>in</b> medical <b>decisions.</b> However, an unwillingness of family members to share <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> must be honored. The delegation of decisional authority is after all an autonomous <b>decision.</b> <b>In</b> a French study, {{more than half of the}} families did not want to share <b>in</b> medical <b>decisions</b> [7], and the number of relatives willing to share decisions was even lower among families that were satisfied with the quality of the information they received. Sharing <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> can result <b>in</b> a substantial burden being placed on the families. Thus, in families of patients involved <b>in</b> end-of-life medical <b>decisions,</b> the risk of posttraumatic stress symptoms was increased 3  months after the death [39]. However, the staff should seek to determine whether the unwillingness to share <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> is related to psychological distress, which may be amenable to alleviation, or to poor understanding of the situation, requiring additional information and communication efforts.|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} well-accepted {{that women are}} more risk averse than men. This {{research}} investigates when gender differences in risk aversion are likely to occur and when {{they are less likely to}} manifest. We find that gender differences in risk aversion are likely to occur <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> under risk, where the probability of outcomes is known and objectively quantified, such as games of chance, and less likely to occur <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> under uncertainty, where one must rely on their own internal subjective expectancies of the probabilities of outcomes – the kind of decisions that dominate our day-to-day decision-making. We propose and test the mechanism that is responsible for producing gender differences in risk aversion: one’s subjective expectancy of the outcome. <b>In</b> <b>decisions</b> under risk, when subjective expectancies are accounted for, the gender difference in risk aversion disappears; while <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> under uncertainty, we do not observe any gender differences in risk aversion, but instead find one’s subjective expectancies of the outcome to be the only reliable predicator of valuation...|$|R
