30|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the use of the enforcement approach is Almeida and Aterido (2008) which developed a proxy for locally varying enforcement, again based on the Enterprise Surveys. The main <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> used were the numbers of visits by labor or tax inspectors. In their empirical model, they include both their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (visits by inspectors) and in one specification also its interaction with the country-level rigidity of labor regulations. Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the ex-post enforcement approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current <b>enforcement</b> timing <b>measures</b> and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be applied to this scenario and analyzed. The purpose of analyzing the ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> is to evaluate how these measures might work, and what the limits are on their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Park {{officials}} at Carara National Park, Costa Rica, face considerable challenges. They believe poaching {{has become a}} significant threat to the park’s biodiversity and that their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> largely due to limited funds, are inadequate. Through family-level interviews in six communities surrounding Carara National Park, this study aims to understand the dynamics of poaching by identifying animals at risk of poaching and identifying communities to target future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> Interviews inquired about interactions with wildlife, perceived populations of wildlife, sale of wildlife, opinions towards hunting, and observed hunting activities. Summary statistics, CART modeling and probit regressions are {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicate hunting is not prevalent {{in terms of the number}} of families that hunt. However, these families can still have significant impacts on wildlife populations with poaching occurring for both subsistence and market-oriented reasons. Two potential community sets are identified as areas to target enforcement. Based on the number of reported families engaging in hunting, enforcement should be targeted in Bijagual and Tárcoles. However, exploring truthfulness through CART and probit regression analysis indicates enforcement should be targeted in El Sur and La Hacienda. Ultimately, future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be determined by Carara officials. Although potential target communities are identified and management practices such as ecotourism and community-based management are potentially viable avenues for reducing poaching, the park faces considerable challenges for enforcement due to its limited financial capabilities...|$|R
