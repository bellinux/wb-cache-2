25|$|The {{pineapple}} gall adelgid is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. Spruce gall aphid, eastern {{spruce pineapple gall adelges}} and <b>eastern</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>aphid</b> are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid, is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|E
25|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges abietis Linnaeus) is an {{introduced}} species that feeds only on spruce. At least in 1985, the species {{was found in}} Canada from Ontario eastward and in adjacent parts of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Balsam twig aphids (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark adelgid, the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), and the <b>eastern</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges abietis). Another serious pest are bagworms. These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, {{the damage caused by}} the silk of bagworms can last years.|$|R
50|$|The aphids {{feed on the}} glucose {{present in}} the gall. Other common <b>gall</b> forming <b>aphids</b> are the spiny {{witch-hazel}} <b>gall</b> <b>aphid</b> and the elm cockscomb <b>gall</b> <b>aphid.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges lariciatus Patch) {{occurs in}} {{alternate}} years on spruce and larch from Alberta to the Maritimes and in adjacent {{parts of the}} United States. The pale <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges strobilobius Kaltenbach) has a similar range but prefers black spruce or red spruce to white spruce.|$|R
2500|$|Similar galls are {{produced}} by other aphids: on Sitka spruce, by the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid, Gilletteela cooleyi, some generations of which migrate to Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia); and on spruce by Cnaphalodes sp., which is heteroecious with larch. The Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgids form a larger gall, [...] long, which usually covers the entire tip of infested new growth.|$|R
50|$|Mayetiola piceae (<b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge) is {{a species}} of gall-forming flies in the Cecidomyiidae family.|$|R
50|$|In {{late summer}} it {{sometimes}} forms galls {{on the underside}} of leaves, caused by the sumac leaf <b>gall</b> <b>aphid,</b> Melaphis rhois. The galls are not harmful to the tree.|$|R
40|$|Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid {{damage was}} found on a White spruce (Picea glauca) at the University of Idaho Plant Science farm just outside Moscow, Idaho. The {{diagnosis}} was made from the observation of galls {{at or near the}} terminal ends of the branches (see Figure 1). Only new growth from the current year was affected. Galls were first observed early in the summer on terminal new growth as soft swollen tissue surrounding the needles. Some of these galls were green; others were beginning to turn a brownish purple. Figure 1 shows the appearance of the gall in late summer and fall. The plant itself was growing well, but damage from previous infestations was visible in slightly distorted growth caused by the loss of the terminal branch ends which induced lateral bud formation and branching and thereby formation of “shrubby ” branches and asymmetrical growth habit. <b>Spruce</b> <b>galls</b> are caused by the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid (Adelges cooleyi). A small aphid-like insect, the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid alternates its life cycle between Picea species and Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).

50|$|Excepting galls {{formed by}} the <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge, galls are caused by aphid-like insects of the family Phylloxeridae (Adelgidae) {{commonly}} known as the <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgids. They have complex life cycles, some species feeding exclusively on spruce, others feeding on spruce and an alternate conifer. However, galls characteristic of each species are formed only on spruce. Six generations are usually needed to complete the 2-year cycle, {{and in the case of}} species having an alternate host, winged adults about 2 mm long are formed only in the generations that move from one host to the other.|$|R
50|$|According to data {{collected}} in 1993 and 1994 during an outbreak in Alberta and the Northwest Territories, galled current-year shoots caused by <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge displayed a {{negative binomial distribution}} described by the mean kp = 5.3333, the variance kpq = 83.0828, and the dispersion parameter k = 0.3007. The data were used to derive a sequential sampling plan for the classification of damage cause by <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge, of use to foresters and pest managers (Brandt 2000). Tiny parasitic wasps usually keep midge populations sufficiently in check to render control measures unnecessary.|$|R

50|$|The {{witch-hazel}} cone <b>gall</b> <b>aphid</b> (Hormaphis hamamelidis) is {{a minuscule}} insect, {{a member of}} the aphid superfamily, whose presence on a witch-hazel plant is easily recognizable by a red conical gall structure. This gall, rich in nutrients, provides both food and shelter for the female aphid.|$|R
50|$|The major {{types of}} {{conifers}} cultivated, pines, Douglas-firs, true firs, and spruce trees, are all affected by {{some types of}} insect pests. Douglas-firs are most vulnerable to the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid. The true firs are most susceptible to insects such as the balsam gall midge (Paradiplosis tumifex), and the balsam twig aphid. Species of spruce trees face assault from insects such as the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid, and the pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae). The final category of Christmas trees, pines, are commonly susceptible to insect infestation and damage from the pine root collar weevil (Hylobius radicis), Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani), pine needle scale, and white pine weevil.|$|R

50|$|Abscission {{can also}} occur in {{premature}} leaves {{as a means}} of plant defense. Premature leaf abscission has been shown to occur in response to infestation by <b>gall</b> <b>aphids.</b> By abscising leaves that have been made host to <b>aphid</b> <b>galls,</b> plants have been shown to massively diminish the pest population, as 98% of <b>aphids</b> in abscised <b>galls</b> died. The abscission is selective, and the chance of dropping leaves increases as the number of galls increase. A leaf with three or more galls was four times more likely to abscise than a leaf with one, and 20 times as likely to be dropped as a leaf without any galls.|$|R

50|$|Pemphigus spyrothecae, or the poplar spiral <b>gall</b> <b>aphid,</b> is {{a social}} insect which {{exhibits}} apparent altruistic behaviors. The <b>aphids</b> form <b>galls</b> and act as colony defenders, at times sacrificing their own lives to do so. It {{has been shown that}} colony defense is more likely in habitats that are difficult to obtain and can hold a large number of individuals. These gall locations are so crucial because plants have a short window in which a gall can be produced. Thus, it is important for there to be a defense system that enables organisms to retain their galls. The need for defense arises when the gall is opened up to allow winged aphid migrants to leave and to release any waste. The process of repairing the holes, in P. spyrotheca, can take up to 10 days; during this time, the gall is susceptible to intruding predators.|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{treatability}} in heartwood {{can cause}} reduced retention and penetration of preservatives into heartwood. This {{can reduce the}} durability of heartwood compared to the treated sapwood. From an anatomical point of view, the factors which contribute to the lower treatability of heartwood include its high extractive content, high rate of aspirated pits, and smaller pore sizes. Generally, in wood members that consists of treated sapwood and untreated heartwood, the durability of treated sapwood is much higher. Untreated heartwood of southern pine, Douglas-fir, Englemann <b>spruce,</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>spruce,</b> red pine, white pine, eastern larch, eastern hemlock, and eastern fir lasts longer in outdoor exposure in the colder northern regions (Wisconsin and Maine) than in warmer southern regions (Mississippi).

50|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge occurred in northern Alberta and adjacent {{areas in the}} Northwest Territories in 1992 (Brandt 2000). The infestation was widespread in white spruce stands, with 84% of surveyed sites infested and twig mortality as high as 81% among current-year shoots. Earlier, Rose and Lindquist (1985) had noted that severe injury to spruce is unusual, and had been recorded only {{from a number of}} locations in Yukon Territory. Levels of damage in the 1992 outbreak decreased at most sites in 1994, and by spring 1995 the outbreak had collapsed. About 15 million ha were affected at the peak. Other outbreaks have occurred in Yukon Territory in 1968 and 1969 (Tripp et al. 1970), in Connecticut in the early 1970s (Stephens 1985), and in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1981 and 1982 (Magasi 1983).
