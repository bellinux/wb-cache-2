40|$|Abstract Background <b>Grass</b> pollen allergens are a {{major cause}} of {{allergic}} respiratory disease but traditionally prescribing practice for <b>grass</b> pollen allergen-specific immunotherapy has favoured pollen extracts of temperate <b>grasses.</b> Here we aim to compare allergy to subtropical and temperate <b>grass</b> pollens in patients with allergic rhinitis from a subtropical region of Australia. Methods Sensitization to pollen extracts of the subtropical Bahia <b>grass</b> (Paspalum notatum), Johnson <b>grass</b> (Sorghum halepense) and Bermuda <b>grass</b> (Cynodon dactylon) as well as the temperate Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were measured by skin prick in 233 subjects from Brisbane. <b>Grass</b> pollen-specific IgE reactivity was tested by ELISA and cross-inhibition ELISA. Results Patients with <b>grass</b> pollen allergy from a subtropical region showed higher skin prick diameters with subtropical Bahia <b>grass</b> and Bermuda <b>grass</b> pollens than with Johnson <b>grass</b> and Ryegrass pollens. IgE reactivity was higher with pollen of Bahia <b>grass</b> than Bermuda <b>grass,</b> Johnson <b>grass</b> and Ryegrass. Patients showed asymmetric cross-inhibition of IgE reactivity with subtropical <b>grass</b> pollens that was not blocked by temperate <b>grass</b> pollen allergens indicating the presence of species-specific IgE binding sites of subtropical <b>grass</b> pollen allergens that are not represented in temperate <b>grass</b> pollens. Conclusions Subtropical <b>grass</b> pollens are more important allergen sources than temperate <b>grass</b> pollens for patients from a subtropical region. Targeting allergen-specific immunotherapy to subtropical <b>grass</b> pollen allergens in patients with allergic rhinitis in subtropical regions could improve treatment efficacy thereby reducing the burden of allergic rhinitis and asthma. </p...|$|R
