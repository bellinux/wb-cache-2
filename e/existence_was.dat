5000|$|To {{paraphrase}} Fazlur Rahman on Mulla Sadra's Existential Cosmology: <b>Existence</b> <b>is</b> the one {{and only}} reality. <b>Existence</b> and reality <b>are</b> therefore identical. <b>Existence</b> <b>is</b> the all-comprehensive reality and there is nothing outside of it. Essences which are negative require some sort of reality and therefore exist. <b>Existence</b> therefore cannot <b>be</b> denied. Therefore <b>existence</b> cannot <b>be</b> negated. As <b>Existence</b> cannot <b>be</b> negated, it is self-evident that it <b>Existence</b> <b>is</b> God. God should not be searched for in the realm of <b>existence</b> but <b>is</b> the basis of all <b>existence.</b> It should <b>be</b> noted that Reality in Arabic is [...] "Al-Haq", and is stated in the Qur'an as one of the Names of God.|$|R

5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its <b>existence</b> <b>was</b> revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E

In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association declared that if sales did not improve for the 2007 ACC Championship game, the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced the same problem.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force.

5|$|HAT-P-33b's <b>existence</b> <b>was</b> first {{suggested}} after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project}} that searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's <b>existence</b> <b>was</b> independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a planet}} {{was found by}} the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team to be {{orbiting}} the star in a very eccentric orbit. It has a minimum mass {{more than three times}} that of Jupiter and has an orbital period of over three years. The planet orbits its star at a distance of approximately two AU away; the planet Earth, in comparison, orbits at a distance of one AU away from the Sun. HD 2039 b's discovery was reported quietly; no press release was provided by the observatory that discovered the star's planet, and no formal announcement of the planet's <b>existence</b> <b>was</b> made.

With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses to be left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose <b>existence</b> <b>was</b> absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together.|$|E
