5000|$|A {{different}} maneuver {{is employed}} in measuring anatomic dead space: the test subject breathes {{all the way}} out, <b>inhales</b> <b>deeply</b> from a 0% nitrogen gas mixture (usually 100% oxygen) and then breathes out into equipment that measures nitrogen and gas volume. This final exhalation occurs in three phases. The first phase has no nitrogen, and is the air that entered the lung {{only as far as}} the conducting airways. The nitrogen concentration then rapidly increases during the brief second phase and finally reaches a plateau, the third phase. The anatomic dead space is equal to the volume exhaled during the first phase plus half that exhaled during the second phase. (The Bohr equation is used to justify the inclusion of half the second phase in this calculation.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Some North American {{cities have}} banned the {{planting}} of mulberries {{because of the}} large amounts of pollen they produce, posing a potential health hazard for some pollen allergy sufferers. In actuality, only the male mulberry trees produce pollen; this light-weight pollen can be <b>inhaled</b> <b>deeply</b> into the lungs, sometimes triggering asthma. Conversely, female mulberry trees produce all-female flowers, which draw pollen and dust from the air. Because of this pollen-absorbing feature, all-female mulberry trees have an OPALS allergy scale rating of just 1 (lowest level of allergy potential), and some consider it [...] "allergy-free".|$|E

Heavy smokers (20 or more cigarettes a day) had a higher average inhaling index than light smokers (fewer than 20 cigarettes a day) both among those who said that they inhaled and among those who {{said that they did}} not. This observation, together with indirect evidence that heavy smokers who <b>inhale</b> <b>deeply</b> may to some extent avoid depositing smoke condensate on their main bronchial epithelium, explains a hitherto unresolved anomaly [...] namely, that the risk of lung cancer is less among heavy cigarette smokers who say that they inhale than it is among those who say that they do not inhale...|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{exercise}} {{can be performed}} using either dumbbells, a barbell, a Smith machine, a cable machine with adjustable pulleys or a specially-designed apparatus. Two exercises should be chosen for each muscle group. Five sets of the first exercise are performed, and then one set of the second. Weights for each set should be chosen so that the specified number of repetitions can be achieved at the specified level of intensity. For example:Weight training sessions proceed at a brisk pace, with one minute of rest between the first four sets for a muscle group, and no rest between the final two sets. The cadence for each repetition should be one second to lift the weight (while exhaling deeply), one second holding it at the top, two seconds to lower the weight (while <b>inhaling</b> <b>deeply)</b> and then one second pausing before the next repetition. Each session should be completed within about 45 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of inhaler is the {{pressurized}} metered-dose inhaler (MDI). In MDIs, medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant, although it may also be a suspension. The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in aerosol form. The correct procedure for using an MDI is to first fully exhale, place the mouth-piece of the device into the mouth, and having just started to inhale at a moderate rate, depress the canister to release the medicine. The aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to <b>inhale</b> <b>deeply</b> before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the bronchittus and other airways of the lung. Some inhalers are made to act instantly in case of an asthma attack, and others are made to act later.|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{abuse is}} the {{deliberate}} inhalation of gases, chemical fumes or vapours {{in order to}} get a "high" or "buzz" similar to the intoxication produced by alcohol. Solvents are chemicals which change from liquid form into gases or vapours at ordinary room temperatures. A variety of terms are used to describe the practice such as "glue sniffing", "solvent abuse", or, technically, "Volatile Substance Abuse" (VSA). The term "glue sniffing" has been widely used in the media but is inaccurate for two reasons; firstly, a wide range of solventcontaining materials is used and secondly the material is not sniffed but actually <b>inhaled</b> <b>deeply</b> through the nose and mouth into the. lungs. In this publication the term "Solvent Abuse" will be used throughout. While the involvement of young children and teenagers is a recent worrying trend, the use of chemical vapours and fumes to obtain a drug experience is believed to go back to pre-historic times...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{deposition}} of 99 Tcm-DTPA aerosol in the components of a jet nebulizer-based aerosol production system. Three impaction devices were compared: a ball-bearing separator, a virtual impactor and a step separator. In addition a comparison {{was made of}} two types of tubing which carried aerosol from nebulizer to mouthpiece: corrugated and smooth-walled tubing. The retention of aerosol following inhalation was measured in five normal volunteers using different patterns of breathing. Using an aerosol production system which included a ball-bearing separator only a mean of 11 % of the radioactivity loaded into the nebulizer was emitted as an aerosol. Some 18 % remained in the ball-bearing separator. The ball-bearing and step separators produced similar total outputs (7 % and 6 % minimum), the step separator producing marginally higher mean output/min. The virtual impactor produced a lower output than the other two impactors studied, only 1 %. A larger proportion of the aerosol output was deposited on corrugated tubing (7 %) compared with smooth-walled tubing (1 %). The retained fraction of the aerosol inhaled by subjects ranged from 16 % to 43 %. A higher fraction was retained when subjects <b>inhaled</b> <b>deeply</b> and held their breath for 10 s between each breath. The efficiency of radionuclide deposition from aerosol generator to patient ranged from 1. 1 % to 6 % and was determined more by the retention in the subject than by choice of separator or tubing...|$|E

2500|$|Smog is {{a serious}} problem in many cities and {{continues}} to harm human health. Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' working capacity, cause shortness of breath, pain when <b>inhaling</b> <b>deeply,</b> wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness.

50|$|The {{spirit is}} sniffed {{so that the}} aroma (nose) can be examined. The nose should be above the rim to start then {{gradually}} deeper into the glass to catch the full aroma. Depending {{on the strength of}} the spirit being analysed, it is advisable not to put the nose too far into the glass and <b>inhale</b> too <b>deeply</b> at first, in case of burning from the fumes. This is particularly true of cask strength spirits, 60% ABV. Standard strength, 40% ABV, are unlikely to affect the nose in this way. Once comfortable with the strength of the spirit, it's typical to take deep sniffs of the spirit with the mouth open, which has the effect of opening up the palate and making it easier to detect aromas. The glass is then swirled whilst warming the whisky with the hand and the nosing process repeated.|$|R

40|$|Background. The American Medical Association (AMA) has {{advocated}} gradually {{reducing the}} nicotine content of cigarettes to decrease smoking prevalence.

The purpose of this research is to estimate the long-term health gains or losses that are likely to accrue to the US population if the nicotine content of cigarettes is gradually reduced to trace levels over a 6 -year period. Methods. To estimate health impacts, we created the Tobacco Policy Model, a computer simulation model. The model simulates the US population as they age and change their smoking behavior over time. Secondary data for model parameters were obtained from publicly available sources.

40|$|Background. The {{rates of}} lung {{adenocarcinoma}} can-cer have risen {{more rapidly than}} the rates of lung squamous cell cancer over the past 2 decades. Methods. A case–control study was carried out to as-sess the impact of long-term filter cigarette smoking on the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and ad-enocarcinoma (AC) of the lung. Results. Odds ratios for SCC among subjects who had smoked only filter cigarettes were reduced rela-tive to lifetime nonfilter cigarette smokers by 30 % for men and by 60 % for women, but no risk reduction was observed for AC of the lung. Conclusion. The predominance of AC over SCC may be {{due in part to}} the fact that smokers of very low yield cigarettes tend to compensate for the lower nicotine levels by <b>inhaling</b> more <b>deeply</b> and frequently, leading to greater exposure of the peripheral lung to the car-cinogens in tobacco smoke, and in part to the in-creased concentration of nitrosamines that preferen-tially produce AC in laboratory animals. © 1997 Academic Press Key Words: lung cancer; histology; smoking; filter; nicotine...|$|R
