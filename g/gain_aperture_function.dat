40|$|Sampling plays a {{critical}} role in remote sensing and signal analysis. In conventional sampling theory, the signal is sampled at a uniform rate at a minimum of twice the signal bandwidth. Sampling with an <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> requires a fixed <b>aperture</b> <b>function,</b> which can be removed by deconvolution after signal reconstruction. However, in some cases the signal samples are available only at irregular positions and different samples use different <b>aperture</b> <b>functions.</b> Here we explore the theory of finite-length signal reconstruction with irregular sam-ples and variable apertures in one and two dimensions is considered. We concentrate on discrete sampling and reconstruction. In the one-dimensional case, a band-limited discrete signal can be exactly recon-structed from a finite number of arbitrarily spaced samples with few restrictions on the <b>aperture</b> <b>functions,</b> which can vary between samples. Exact reconstruction in the two-dimensional case requires the sampling location matrix be invertable, and is not always possible. Variable <b>aperture</b> <b>functions,</b> while complicating the process, can enable reconstruction for a broader range of sample loca-tions. Note that two-dimensional reconstruction from general cubic lattice samplings, which include uniform sampling, are always fully invertable in the ideal aperture case. We consider a number of practical issues and provide some numerical examples based on simulated special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) radiometer measurements which have variable apertures. We note that variable aperture reconstruction has application in a variety of remote sensing and other signal processing problems. ...|$|R

40|$|AMSR-E is a space-borne {{radiometer}} {{which measures}} Earth microwave emissions or brightness temperatures (TB) {{over a wide}} swath. AMSR-E data and images are useful in mapping valuable Earth-surface and atmospheric phenomena. A {{modified version of the}} Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm creates TB images from the collected data. SIR is an iterative algorithm with tuning parameters to optimize the reconstruction for the instrument and channel. It requires an approximate <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> for each channel to be effective. This thesis presents a simulator-based optimization of SIR iteration and <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> threshold parameters for each AMSR-E channel. A comparison of actual TB images generated using the optimal and sub-optimal values is included. Tuned parameters produce images with sharper transitions between regions of low and high TB for lower-frequency channels.

5000|$|Whenever a {{function}} is discontinuously truncated in one FT domain, broadening and rippling are {{introduced in the}} other FT domain. A perfect example from optics is {{in connection with the}} point spread function, which for on-axis plane wave illumination of a quadratic lens (with circular aperture), is an Airy function, J1(x)/x. Literally, the point source has been [...] "spread out" [...] (with ripples added), to form the Airy point spread function (as the result of truncation of the plane wave spectrum by the finite aperture of the lens). This source of error is known as Gibbs phenomenon and it may be mitigated by simply ensuring that all significant content lies {{near the center of the}} transparency, or through the use of window functions which smoothly taper the field to zero at the frame boundaries. By the convolution theorem, the FT of an arbitrary transparency function - multiplied (or truncated) by an <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> - is equal to the FT of the non-truncated transparency function convolved against the FT of the <b>aperture</b> <b>function,</b> which in this case becomes a type of [...] "Greens function" [...] or [...] "impulse response function" [...] in the spectral domain. Therefore, the image of a circular lens is equal to the object plane function convolved against the Airy function (the FT of a circular <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> is J1(x)/x and the FT of a rectangular <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> is a product of sinc functions, sin x/x).|$|R
