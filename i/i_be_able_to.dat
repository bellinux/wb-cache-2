500|$|In 1915 and 1916, Michelena {{wrote the}} regular {{newspaper}} column [...] "Talks with Screen-struck Girls", carried at {{first by the}} San Rafael Independent on Tuesdays but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers: San Francisco Examiner and the Prescott Journal-Miner (Arizona). She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ride" [...] and [...] "Must <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1990, {{before the}} start of Favre's senior year at Southern Miss, he was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama. Alabama coach Gene Stallings said, [...] "You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to. I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> look {{at myself in the mirror}} happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

2500|$|In Berlin, he insinuated {{himself into}} the Nazi Party and read Nazi propaganda, in {{particular}} Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Sorge attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking {{so as not to}} say anything inappropriate. His abstinence from drinking did not make his Nazi companions suspicious. It was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission, as he was a heavy drinker. He later explained to Hede Massing, [...] "That was the bravest thing I ever did. Never will <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> drink enough to make up for this time." [...] Later, his drinking came to undermine his work.|$|E
