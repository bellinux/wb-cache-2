5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or <b>inertial)</b> motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (<b>inertial)</b> mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred <b>inertial</b> motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser <b>Inertial</b> Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven <b>inertial</b> confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as <b>inertial</b> fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global <b>inertial</b> frames. Instead there are approximate <b>inertial</b> frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free <b>inertial</b> frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, <b>inertial</b> or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>inertial</b> effect, {{the lighter}} {{alveolar}} tissue is sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury. It results {{from the fact that}} different tissues have different densities, and therefore different rates of acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between inertia {{and gravity}} cannot explain tidal effects– it cannot explain {{variations in the}} gravitational field. For that, a theory is needed which describes the way that matter (such as the large mass of the Earth) affects the <b>inertial</b> environment around it.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the <b>inertial</b> effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of change}} in the {{distance}} between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their closing speed) may have a value in excess ofc. However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single <b>inertial</b> frame.|$|E
5|$|When braking, {{the rider}} in motion {{is seeking to}} change {{the speed of the}} {{combined}} mass m of rider plus bike. This is a negative acceleration a in the line of travel. F=ma, the acceleration a causes an <b>inertial</b> forward force F on mass m.|$|E
5|$|All RAF GR.1s and {{the initial}} AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 <b>inertial</b> navigation/attack suite, but these were {{replaced}} in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new <b>inertial</b> navigation system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; {{at the same time}} several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that <b>inertial</b> motions, once {{identified}} by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of <b>inertial</b> and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an <b>inertial</b> navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's astronomical discoveries and {{investigations}} into the Copernican theory {{have led to a}} lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) as the Galilean moons. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed Galileo global satellite navigation system, the transformation between <b>inertial</b> systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the Galileo, which is a non-SI unit of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{universality}} of free fall, there is no observable distinction between <b>inertial</b> motion and motion {{under the influence of}} the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of <b>inertial</b> motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. In this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inertial</b> {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|Near the aircraft, a {{point cloud}} in three {{dimensions}} is acquired by changing {{the orientation of the}} laser scanning sensors fixed on pan-tilt units. After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with the model of the aircraft is used to estimate the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation by considering its wheel odometry, its <b>inertial</b> unit and visual odometry.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Move is a motion-sensing game {{controller}} {{platform for the}} PlayStation 3 video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on the handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye webcam to track the wand's position and the <b>inertial</b> sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move was launched in Q3/Q4 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller and an optional PlayStation Move sub-controller.|$|E
5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the <b>inertial</b> and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and <b>inertial</b> {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an <b>inertial</b> navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E
5|$|The TLAM {{could be}} {{equipped}} with an <b>inertial</b> and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) radar guidance package to find and destroy its target. The TERCOM radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the target. Terminal guidance in the target area {{was provided by the}} optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which compared a stored image of target with the actual target image.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and <b>inertial</b> effects {{does not}} constitute a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, <b>inertial</b> reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power <b>inertial</b> confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and <b>inertial</b> guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced <b>inertial</b> guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the original}} combat system was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the Collins class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser <b>inertial</b> navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inertial</b> {{frame of}} reference, in {{classical}} physics, is {{a frame of}} reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an <b>inertial</b> frame have no causes external to the system. An <b>inertial</b> frame of reference may also be called an <b>inertial</b> reference frame, <b>inertial</b> frame, Galilean reference frame, or <b>inertial</b> space.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the realm}} of Newtonian mechanics, an <b>inertial</b> frame of {{reference}}, or <b>inertial</b> reference frame, {{is one in which}} Newton's first law of motion is valid. However, the principle of special relativity generalizes the notion of <b>inertial</b> frame to include all physical laws, not simply Newton's first law.|$|E
25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an <b>inertial</b> frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid <b>inertial</b> frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, <b>inertial</b> frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define <b>inertial</b> frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single <b>inertial</b> frame is defined as an element of this set.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} a {{dimensionless}} quantity which characterises {{the magnitude of}} <b>inertial</b> effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (Re<<1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to <b>inertial</b> forces. In such cases, <b>inertial</b> forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an <b>inertial</b> frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the <b>inertial</b> frame has a simpler physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the <b>inertial</b> frame, fictitious forces are zero. See <b>inertial</b> frame for more detail.|$|E
25|$|If a nonspinning <b>inertial</b> {{observer}} looks {{along his}} axis of symmetry, {{he sees his}} coaxial nonspinning <b>inertial</b> peers apparently nonspinning with respect to himself, as we would expect.|$|E
25|$|Two events {{happening}} {{in two different}} locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one <b>inertial</b> observer, may occur non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another <b>inertial</b> observer (lack of absolute simultaneity).|$|E
25|$|<b>Inertial</b> (cameraless) systems {{based on}} MEMS <b>inertial</b> sensors, biomechanical models, and sensor fusion algorithms. These {{full-body}} or partial body {{systems can be}} used indoors and outdoors regardless of lighting conditions.|$|E
25|$|A pair of <b>inertial</b> sensors {{inside the}} controller, a three-axis linear {{accelerometer}} and a three-axis angular rate sensor, {{are used to}} track rotation as well as overall motion. An internal magnetometer is also used for calibrating the controller's orientation against the Earth's magnetic field to help correct against cumulative error (drift) by the <b>inertial</b> sensors. In addition, an internal temperature sensor is used to adjust the <b>inertial</b> sensor readings against temperature effects. The <b>inertial</b> sensors {{can be used for}} dead reckoning in cases which the camera tracking is insufficient, such as when the controller is obscured behind the player's back.|$|E
