40|$|Dielectric {{polymer film}} {{capacitors}} with {{high energy density}}, low loss, and fast <b>discharge</b> <b>speed</b> are highly desirable for compact and reliable electrical power systems. However, achieving both high energy density and low loss as well as fast <b>discharge</b> <b>speed</b> is difficult. Even though PVDF-based ferroelectric homopolymer and copolymers receive much attention due to the high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, the challenge for their application in electric energy storage lies in reducing the conduction and ferroelectric loss. The key is to understand the fundamental dipole reorientation and switching mechanisms {{in response to an}} oscillating electric field and in turn their effects on energy storage behavior. In this work, the compensation polarization in ferroelectric polymers was reduced by confining ferroelectric domains can facilitate a fast dipole reorientation during discharge and in turn the ferroelectric loss will be reduced and the discharged energy density will increase. ^ Based on the fundamental understanding, confined ferroelectric properties were achieved by confining the PVDF lamellar crystals with a low polarizability polystyrene (PS) interphase layer to reduce the compensation polarization in PVDF copolymers. Moreover, the confinement effect of different PS contents on ferroelectric and dielectric properties was investigated in a family of the P(VDF-CTFE) -g-PS graft copolymers with different PS grafting length. At low degree of confinement (i. e. low PS wt%), the antiferroelectric-like behavior was observed at an electric field as high as 400 MV/m as well as extremely low remnant polarization and low ferroelectric loss. At high degree of confinement (i. e. high PS wt%), the confined ferroelectric behavior had narrow hysteresis loops and became more like that for linear dielectrics. As a result, both dielectric and ferroelectric losses were significantly reduced at the expense of a moderate decrease in the discharged energy density. The best performance for high energy density and low loss dielectric capacitor applications was achieved in the P(VDF-CTFE) -g-PS with ∼ 34 wt. % PS, a relatively high discharged Ue of ∼ 10 J/cm 3 at 600 MV/m (extrapolated from 550 MV/m), a fairly low dielectric loss (tanδ = 0. 006 at 1 kHz), and a low ferroelectric/conduction loss (undischarged% = 17. 6 % at 550 MV/m). ...|$|R

With precision control of {{voltage and current}} levels in secondary batteries, high performance in battery life can be achieved and the problems of overcharging and over discharging in batteries can be avoided. By regulating the charge and discharge currents in a battery, voltage can be balanced. As the behavior of temperature and impedance of a battery is highly non-linear in nature, balancing current and voltage is very difficult. This paper proposes an Optimizing Intelligent Algorithm which can efficiently control the voltage and current levels by overcoming the problem of non-linear behavior of impedance in batteries. Results of the proposed algorithm from control circuit in an experiment are shown to provide efficient control of voltage and current levels in a battery increasing the battery life. Index Terms— — battery balance, impedance of battery, intelligent algorithm, secondary battery cell. This method is stable but has low performance because battery cells discharge until their voltages reach the average value which does {{not allow us to}} use the full power of battery.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of discrete element simulations applied to a bucket elevator model with particular reference to the head pulley transition zone. This is the first stage in a larger study to better understand the mechanics of bucket elevator operation with reference to the discharge of particles at the head end. At the head end two issues arise; mechanically, the buckets are bolted to the conveying media (typically a fabric reinforced belt) and at the point of belt to headpulley tangency, the tip of the bucket undergoes a theoretical step change in velocity. This theoretical step change results in a classical under-damped response in the buckets tip velocity. In undergoing this motion, there are stresses that are passed to the carcass of the conveying media; understanding the magnitude of these stresses is one longer term goal of this research allowing a quantitative basis for the existing qualitative design guidelines such as (Handbook for conveyor and elevator belting, Apex Belting Pty Ltd). The discharge of the bulk material from the bucket has been addressed Beverly et al.

Ignoring the transition with a low <b>speed</b> <b>discharge</b> elevator is not likely to impact on the predicted discharge pattern, however with high <b>speed</b> <b>discharge</b> elevators, the destabilising effect of the transition is expected to promote premature discharge of bulk material from the bucket.
