25|$|While not {{the first}} {{dependence}} receptor pair discovered, DCC and netrin-1 are an often quoted example of a dependence receptor system. When DCC is present on the membrane and bound to netrin-1, signals are conveyed {{that can lead to}} proliferation and cell migration. In the absence of netrin-1, DCC signaling has been shown to induce apoptosis. Only in the absence of DCC <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> absence of downstream signaling. There are therefore three possible signaling states for dependence receptors: on (ligand-bound, migration and proliferation), off (ligand-unbound, apoptosis inducing) and absent (lack of signal).|$|E
25|$|Eighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom—New Year's Day, 1871: On this {{occasion}} the Boston papers related that “...seldom <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background {{about her own}} life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E
500|$|Interpretations of {{the purpose}} of the History also vary considerably, some {{considering}} it a work of fiction or satire intended to entertain (perhaps in the vein of 1066 and All That), others viewing it as a pagan attack on Christianity, the writer having concealed his identity for personal safety. Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian's reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip's reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian's reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It also avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. In fact, where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the History. Further, it is noted that the History also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the Life of Alexander Severus there is: [...] "It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea", while [...] "where, save at Rome, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> imperial power that rules an empire?"

500|$|Only three {{works by}} Egardus survive. [...] A canon, Furnos reliquisti quare; Equum est et salutare {{is found in}} a single source, Mod A (Modena, Biblioteca Estense e Universitaria alpha.M.5.24). [...] His other two works have a {{somewhat}} wider distribution. [...] The Gloria with the trope [...] "Spiritus et Alme" [...] appears in three sources, Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek 1846 (olim 37, independently discovered by Schmid and Strohm) and two sources from Padua, Biblioteca Universitaria: MSS Ba 2.2.a (formerly 1225, part of Pad D) and 1475 (part of Pad A). [...] Both of the Paduan sources originally come from the Paduan abbey of Santa Giustina. [...] An untroped Gloria appears in five independent sources: Warsaw, Biblioteka Narodowa, MS III.8054 (olim Biblioteka Krasiński 52, commonly called Kras.) f. 204v-205r, Mod A f. 21v-22r, a collection of sources in Grottaferrata and at Dartmouth College (f. Dv-4r), Padua Ba 2.2.a (1225), f. 1v, and, recently identified, in Udine, Archivio di Stato framm. 22 recto (part of Cividale A). [...] In the Warsaw source, the work is labeled [...] "Opus Egardi." [...] In Mod A, [...] "Egardus" [...] is used. [...] In no other source of this work <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> attribution. [...] Strohm notes that Egardus's music is less complex than other mid-century composers, but this lack of complexity can either be attributed to an early date for its composition, contemporaneous with Philippe de Vitry, or a far later date, just prior to Johannes Ciconia).|$|E

2500|$|Mikael Wood for the Los Angeles Times {{enjoyed the}} first Gibson Amphitheatre concert, writing that it [...] "had the triumphant, {{sometimes}} self-satisfied {{feel of a}} victory lap." [...] MTV's Aimee Curran also gave the concert a positive review, writing: [...] "The cast {{was able to make}} every song their own while still managing to maintain the original artist's integrity."

[...] Variety Andrew Barker gave a less favorable review, writing: [...] "while its distinctive blend of high camp and recognizable tunes may click on the small screen, when translated to stage the conceit becomes little more than a frantic, under-imagined jukeboxer, and only occasionally a well-performed one. Four-city tour will likely rake in the cash and merit a reprise, but whether it deserves it is a different matter."
