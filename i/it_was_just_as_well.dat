500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> since he would have them shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous people in Europe as a proponent of liberty; Washington sent a diplomat to invite him to become an American general. [...] Garibaldi {{declined}} the offer because he would not be given supreme power over all the armies, and because the United States was not yet committed to abolishing slavery. [...] Historians agree that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> because he was too independent in thought and deed to have worked smoothly with the U.S. government.|$|E
2500|$|Ji favored {{trade with}} Western Europe and foreign investment, {{one of the}} first in the {{government}} to do so, because he believed that China needed Western technology in order to develop. But he also insisted that this foreign trade should be balanced, adding that Beijing would have to conduct marketing efforts to promote Chinese goods abroad. Some criticized him for this openness to the West and for his American education and contacts, saying that he [...] "drank too much American water." [...] His brother, Chaoji, later commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that Chaoding was divorced from his wife, Harriet, for their marriage would have prevented him from playing {{a major role in the}} Party. He then married Luo Jingyi, another Chinese student activist who had joined the Communist Party in the United States in the 1920s.|$|E

60|$|This terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar {{lawyer was}} too much for Miss Brentwood's nerves. Her {{hysteria}} became violent, and she was helped, weeping and laughing, out of the room. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> for there was worse to follow.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} of his case, which was second in the list, Soames was again obliged to start without seeing Irene, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> for he had not as yet {{made up his mind}} what {{attitude}} to adopt towards her.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{that they}} did not adhere to their {{original}} plan, for when Ben explained to Master Spry the reason why they could not keep their engagement with him, he gruffly told them that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> for he had already made up his mind to go to Jersey City in search of the defaulter, Tim Dooley. Therefore they were not troubled with any pangs of conscience because they were leaving Dickey to mourn alone while they planned the transformation of the attic, and their dinner was eaten with a celerity that astonished their landlady. Johnny took upon himself the duties of architect, and, considering the difficulties in the way of such labor, the others were not unwilling that he should hold the office.|$|E

60|$|In {{the past}} Miss Hammond's {{sense of humor}} had often helped her to {{overlook}} critical exactions natural to her breeding. She kept silence, and she imagined <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that her veil hid her face at the moment. She had been prepared to find cowboys rather striking, {{and she had been}} warned not to laugh at them.|$|E

"I {{congratulate you}} on your success, Mr. Ferguson," [...] he said, shaking hands with the first lieutenant; [...] "it {{has been a very}} hot affair, and by Mr. Morrison's report <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that I decided to change my plan and come up to your aid, though it has {{resulted}} in two of the prahus getting away." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Merdle {{circulated}} the news, as {{she received}} congratulations on it, with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage, as the setting displays the jewel. Yes, she said, Edmund {{had taken the}} place. Mr Merdle wished him to take it, and he had taken it. She hoped Edmund might like it, but really she didn't know. It would keep him in town a good deal, and he preferred the country. Still, {{it was not a}} disagreeable position--and it was a position. There was no denying that the thing was a compliment to Mr Merdle, and was not a bad thing for Edmund if he liked it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that he should have something to do, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that he should have something for doing it. Whether it would be more agreeable to Edmund than the army, remained to be seen.|$|E
