5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe.</b> It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe,</b> teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
50|$|Martnaham Loch is a SSSI for {{the western}} half of its area. The {{south-western}} end of the loch is bordered by mixed woodland. Martnaham has had some notable rarities recorded over the years, such as smew, ring-necked duck, black tern, lesser scaup and hobby. Autumn and winter feature visits from flocks of goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and teal. Shoveller, scaup, long-tailed duck and gadwall are commonly seen and glaucous, Iceland and Mediterranean gulls are occasional visitors. Greylag geese and whooper swans gather in the surrounding fields. <b>Great</b> <b>crested</b> and little <b>grebe</b> breed here. Oystercatcher, curlew, redshank, common sandpiper, whimbrel, ruff, green sandpiper, black-tailed godwit, wheatear and whinchat are regular visitors.|$|R
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{may be found in}} the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. The wintering wildfowl include wigeon (est. 4000), teal (est. 1500) and mallard (est. 1000) in large numbers. Smaller numbers can be seen of pintail and shoveler. Tufted duck, pochard, goldeneye and <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> and little <b>grebe</b> are amongst the diving birds at peak floods. Regular visitors are Bewick's swan and white-fronted geese. There is a small breeding population of mallard, lapwing, snipe, curlew and redshank. Other breeding species including redstart, grasshopper warbler, sedge warbler, yellow wagtail and reed bunting. The meadows are also used as a feeding ground by many migrants. Snipe are the most common, but whimbrel, green sandpiper, greenshank and ruff may be seen. In some winters up to 4000 fieldfare are present and peregrine falcon and hobby may be seen, these birds being attracted by the small birds.|$|R

25|$|The {{valley of}} the Charente {{upstream}} from Angoulême is a Natura 2000 zone with remarkable species: 64 species of birds. Among them are species for marshland and wetland; and at Angoulême {{it is common to}} see diving and swimming birds, swans (mute swan), grebes (black-necked grebe, little grebe, horned grebe, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe),</b> geese (greylag goose), ducks (gadwall, pintail, wigeon, shoveler), teal (garganey, teal) and scaup (pochard, tufted duck) on the Charente. It is more rare to see waders. Terns, gulls (laughing gull), great cormorants, return during periods of storms from far upstream on the river.|$|E
25|$|A heronry {{is located}} by Trentabank Reservoir within the reserve; with around twenty-two nests, {{it is the}} largest in the Peak District. The heronry is visible from several viewpoints, and {{close-up}} CCTV pictures of the nests can also be seen in the Trentabank ranger station. Other birds observed in the woodland include crossbills, siskins, goldcrests, pied flycatchers, garden warblers, blackcaps and woodcocks, while the reservoirs support abundant waterfowl including cormorants, coots, goldeneyes, pochard, mallards, tufted ducks, teal, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe,</b> little grebe and common sandpipers. A herd of around twelve red deer, the remnant of the royal forest herd, still frequents the forest. Small mammals present in the woodland include badgers and weasels.|$|E

25|$|The campus lake is {{the largest}} plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The {{decision}} by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin {{as the site of}} the Heslington West was built on generally flat agricultural land and it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including greylag, Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, tufted duck, and common pochards. There is also a growing population of black swans and a few <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe.</b> Herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to spend {{a year at the}} Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe,</b> later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.|$|E

40|$|Current {{ecological}} surveys for <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newts are {{time-consuming and}} expensive {{and can only}} be carried out within a short survey window. Additional survey methods which would facilitate the detection of rare or protected species such as the <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus cristatus) would be extremely advanta- geous. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has been utilized {{for the detection of}} <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newts in Denmark. Here, the same methodology has been applied to water samples taken from UK ponds concurrently with conventional field surveying techniques. Our eDNA analysis exhibited an 84 % success rate with a kappa coefficient of agreement between field and eDNA surveys of 0. 86. One pond determined to be negative for <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newt by field survey was positive by eDNA analysis, revealing the potential for improved detection rates using this methodology. Analysis of water samples collected in late summer indicates that eDNA analysis could be used to detect <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newt after the optimal survey window for current field techniques had passed. Conse- quently, eDNA analysis could augment currently stipulated techniques for <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newt surveying as a relatively quick and inexpensive tool for collecting <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> newt presence and distribution data within the UK instead of or prior to full field surveys...|$|R
2500|$|Common {{birds are}} mallard and common gull, but other {{species such as}} common goldeneye, common tern, {{and a couple of}} black-throated diver are {{breeding}} by the lake and herons and ospreys are feeding in the area.

2500|$|The {{wild fauna}} {{of the valley}} is similar to other nearby valleys and {{includes}} the badger, grey squirrel, hare, hedgehog, rabbit, roe deer, red deer, red fox, stoat, weasel, buzzard, cuckoo, house martin, peregrine, raven, ring ouzel, swallow, swift, and slowworm. Rarely the adder, otter [...] and red squirrel are seen. Pine marten, previously rare, are no longer seen in the valley. The tarn shore supports a population of <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe</b> and the dark green fritillary butterfly.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley's first 'trial run' was the {{treatment}} of evolution in the Science of Life (1929–30), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association. In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics. Two of these papers were {{on the subject of}} sexual selection, an idea of Darwin's whose standing has been revived in recent times. Huxley thought that sexual selection was [...] "…merely an aspect of natural selection which… is concerned with characters which subserve mating, and are usually sex-limited". This rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe</b> (and other birds that pair for life): the courtship takes place mostly after mate selection, not before.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{catchment}} is biologically rich, with 45 {{species of}} birds, {{which include the}} southern <b>crested</b> <b>grebe,</b> shoveler and scaup. The Australian shoveller is a common bird seen in the lake area, as well as pelicans, black swans and ducks. Six species of waterbirds have been recorded in total. Paradise shelducks flock here during the summer season, seeking sanctuary when they become flightless during their moult. Freshwater snails Potamopyrgus antipodarum have also been analysed in the basin area. For example, studies in 1994 found {{that there are more}} male snails in the lake's shallow water than females, and that snails are sicker in shallow water than deep water.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to document {{and compare the}} aquatic bird communities of two high country lakes, Lake Pearson and Lake Grasmere, located in the Cass Basin, Waimakariri Valley, Canterbury. The two lakes show differences in shoreline structure, riparian communities and humun use patterns. Lake Pearson is regularly used by people for recreation while Lake Grasmere is a Wildlife Refuge and recreation activities are restricted. Data is gathered on bird abundance and feeding activity {{over the course of}} eleven months. The bird communities of these lakes showed differences in species composition and abundance within their community structure with Lake Pearson exhibiting greater species richness and Lake Grasmere greater abundance. These differences were the result of many interactions occurring between lake morphology and component aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, season and life cycle influences and human disturbances to the lakes. Species demonstrated different responses to these factors. Extensive aquatic macrophytes in Lake Grasmere attract large abundances of waterfowl, particularly Black Swans and Canada Geese. The latter species has the potential to significantly add to the nutrient loading of the lake. Species composition and abundance were also influenced by season, with some bird species migrating away from the lakes to escape the harsh winter or to travel to breeding grounds. Lake Grasmere is important as a moulting site for waterfowl, particularly Paradise Shelduck and as a feeding habitat for the threatened species, <b>crested</b> <b>Grebe.</b> Lake Pearson is an important breeding habitat for <b>Crested</b> <b>Grebe</b> but experiences regular disturbance from human recreation...|$|R

2500|$|The Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary {{stands out}} {{from all the}} {{wildlife}} sanctuaries {{in the state in}} terms of sighting wild animals. One of the major reasons for this is its proximity to the Hirakud dam as it provides a perfect water source host for the animals, birds and aquatic fauna of the sanctuary. Apart from the animals already inhabiting the sanctuary, migratory birds also come to explore the nearly 150km2 area of the Hirakud reservoir. As the dam is a standing water body, many varieties of diving ducks can be seen. The sanctuary may welcome the largest number of diving ducks in winter compared to all the other sanctuaries in Orissa. Birds such as the red crested pochard and <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>grebe</b> are seen in large numbers.
