It occurs 46 days (40 fasting days, if the six Sundays, {{which are}} not days of fast, are excluded) before Easter and can fall as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.

25|$|Easter Sunday, which {{immediately}} follows Holy Week {{and begins}} with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or Eastertide, which runs from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday. The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday {{is the main reason}} why Christians keep Sunday as the primary day of religious observance.|$|E

25|$|Kurdish {{culture is}} a group of {{distinctive}} cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish {{culture is a}} legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society, but primarily Iranian. Among their neighbours, the Kurdish culture is closest to Persian culture. For example, they celebrate Newroz as the new year day, which is celebrated on March 21. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the month of Xakelêwe in Kurdish calendar and the first day of spring. Other peoples such as Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians, Shabaks and Mandeans have their own distinctive cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Yom Kippur is [...] "the tenth day of [...] seventh month" [...] (Tishrei) and is {{regarded}} as the [...] "Sabbath of Sabbaths".

2500|$|The {{earliest}} May Day celebrations {{appeared with}} the Floralia, festival of Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, held on April 27 during the Roman Republic era, {{and with the}} Walpurgis Night celebrations of the Germanic countries. [...] It is also associated with the Gaelic Beltane, most commonly held on April 30. <b>The</b> day <b>was</b> a traditional summer holiday in many European pagan cultures. [...] While February 1 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of spring, May 1 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of summer; hence, the summer solstice on June 25 (now June 21) was Midsummer.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning on {{the second}} night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan, Jews begin the {{practice}} of the Counting of the Omer, a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of Shavuot 50 days hence. Each night after the evening prayer service, men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, [...] "Today <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> in (or, to) the Omer"; {{on the second}} night, [...] "Today is the second day in the Omer." [...] The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, [...] "Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer." [...] The eighth day is marked, [...] "Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer," [...] etc.|$|E
2500|$|The Yuledays are {{the days}} that signify {{the end of an}} old year and the {{beginning}} of a new one, so 2 Yule <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the year. The Lithedays are the three days in the middle of the year, 1 Lithe, Mid-year's Day, and 2 Lithe. In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day is added after Mid-year's Day called Overlithe. [...] All these days are placed outside of any month. These days are primarily holidays and feast days. Mid-year's Day is meant to correspond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10 days earlier than the middle day of our year. However, since then the summer solstice has shifted slightly so it falls on a different date now, rendering the difference between Mid-year's Day and the middle day of our year eleven days, instead of ten.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> in the term of office of new Chief Judge Dan Francisco, who in an earlier story has won an {{election}} for chief judge after campaigning on an anti-mutant platform. He exiles his predecessor as chief judge, Judge Hershey, and Judge Dredd from the city, due to their strong support for mutant rights. Francisco stops mutant immigration into Mega-City One and begins a policy of encouraging mutants to leave the city and live in four townships being built in the Cursed Earth, the inhospitable, radioactive desert outside the city. Dredd is put in charge of overseeing the construction and development of the townships, ostensibly because he is the best man for the job, but really in order to keep him out of the way. As a further punishment, Dredd's protégé Judge Beeny is sent with him as his deputy.|$|E
