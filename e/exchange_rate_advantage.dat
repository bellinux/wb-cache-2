However, they were not as significant as in {{the stage of}} continued RMB appreciation. Some scholars believe that the spillover effects between these two markets would become progressively significant with increasing capital market reform and the continuous development of financial liberalization. However, it is the actual operations performance of the foreign exchange and stock markets that can test whether those theories and such reasoning are correct. The global stock market suffered a slump due to global financial crisis. At the same time, China effectively halted the trend of RMB appreciation {{in order to protect}} exports from greater decline. Consequently, the RMB/USD exchange rate began to shift from continuous appreciation to constant shocks to maintain the stability of the stock market. We have to take flexible measures to deal with emergencies while recognizing market-oriented trends in the financial markets. The government’s strong regulation {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the stability of the stock market. However, the financial crisis dampened investor enthusiasm and confidence, and the expectation of RMB appreciation at this stage can no longer boost the stock market boom as fast as the earlier stage of continuous RMB appreciation. These days, as foreign demands for RMB appreciation intensifies, the airline industry is benefiting from the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>advantage</b> and is demonstrated an ascending trend.

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the causes of this development. To this end an augmented Dornbusch-type “Ricardian” model is estimated using panel data. The explanatory variables considered are productivity, unit labor costs, unit values, trade costs, price levels, and real exchange rates; all variables are evaluated in relative terms. Due to data restrictions, China’s relative exports (to the US, Argentina, Japan, Korea, the UK, Germany, and Spain) will be compared to Mexico’s exports for a number of sectors over a limited period of eleven years. Panel and pooled estimation techniques (SUR estimation, panel Feasible Generalized Least Squares (panel/pooled FGLS)) will be utilized to better control for country-specific effects and correlation over time. A simulation underlines the positive impact of relative real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>advantages</b> on relative exports for the textile sector.

A common {{argument is that}} the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> has a natural advantage {{because it is more}} transparent: it is easier for the public to monitor than the money growth rate. We formalize this argument in a simple model in which the government chooses which instrument it will use to target inflation.

The basket feature of the RCU yields benefits and costs. First, the use of the RCU central rate can make the intervention burden of a central bank less onerous than the use of a bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Also, for any given band of margins, a basket unit offers more flexibility than a bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Another <b>advantage</b> of using the RCU is that the variance of RCU <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is smaller than the variance of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of component countries. However, the usefulness of the RCU as a unit of account for domestic transactions and contracts will be very limited because of information costs and uncertainty about the value of the RCU. Also, theintroduction of the RCU raises the important problem of asymmetry for foreign exchange market intervention. Once such a problem is solved, the RCU can be then used as a divergence indicator to monitor the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of Asian currencies between themselves and against the US dollar or the euro.

The leading assumption {{of this paper is}} that information which can be distilled from public debates on Twitter has predictive content for <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements. This assumption prompted a Twitter-based <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> model that harnesses regARIMA analyses for short-term out-of-sample ex post forecasts of the daily closing prices of EUR/USD spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> The analyses used Tweet counts collected from January 1, 2012 - September 27, 2013. To identify concepts mentioned on Twitter with a predictive potential the analysis followed a 2 -step selection. Firstly, a heuristic qualitative analysis assembled a long list of 594 concepts, e. g., Merkel, Greece, Cyprus, crisis, chaos, growth, unemployment expected to covary with {{the ups and downs of}} the EUR/USD <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Secondly, cross-validation using window averaging with a fixed-sized rolling origin was deployed to select concepts and corresponding univariate time series that had error scores below chance level as defined by the random walk model. With regard to a short list of 17 concepts (covariates), in particular SP (Standard & Poor's) and risk, the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the Twitter-based regARIMA model was found to be repeatedly better than that obtained from both the random walk model and a random noise covariate in 1 -step ahead forecasts of the EUR/USD <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> This <b>advantage</b> was evident on the level of forecast error metrics (MSFE, MAE) when a majority vote over different estimation windows was conducted.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} extent to which a decade of {{analysis}} and experience has altered thinking about the choice of an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system. The <b>advantages</b> of flexible <b>rates</b> are viewed to have been exaggerated. They do not permit governments to have permanently higher rates of economic activity at the expense of higher inflation as some thought. Further, the slow speed of adjustment to relative price changes limits the contribution of flexible rates to external adjustment in the short-run, and the degree of insulation from external influences that they provide. Finally, flexible rates tend to be fluctuating rates, and, although there is little empirical evidence so far showing that the fluctuations have had adverse effects on trade and capital flows, the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> instability more than any other factor has led to a certain disillusionment with the floating rate system. Notwithstanding the drawbacks of flexible rates, there will be a continuing need for <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility over the next few years, and some analysis is given of the problems of achieving greater stability under flexible rates or the requisite amount of flexibility under pegged rates. ...|$|R

Our analysis reveals considerable dissimilarities in the economic characteristics of the countries in west and central Africa. In particular, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) countries do not form a cluster with the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries; and, within the WAMZ, there is a significant lack of homogeneity. Furthermore, when west and central African countries are considered together, we find significant heterogeneities within the CFA franc zone, and some interesting similarities between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and WAMZ countries.

Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;Economic conditions;exchange <b>rate,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, inflation performance, terms of trade, foreign exchange, lower inflation, monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, macroeconomic performance, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation targeting, money growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> high inflation, annual inflation, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classification, inflation <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rigidity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, terms of trade shocks, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, rigid <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> inflationary expectations, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> reserves, money supply, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> natural <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rate of inflation, real interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency values, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, post-crisis period, currency boards, official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, variable inflation, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, average inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, monetary economics, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, stable <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> black market, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> price inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> band, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, currency areas, currency convertibility, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> low inflation, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> path, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, inflation growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classifications, macroeconomic stability, explicit <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> controls, inflation target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choice, freely floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real rates, independent central bank, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> unification, average inflation <b>rate,</b> intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> annual inflation <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangement, bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> information, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crises, basket of currencies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choices...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{creating}} a new currency union is setting the rates to convert national currencies into the new union currency. Planned unions in the Gulf region and Africa are seeking methods to set the conversion rates when their new currencies are created. We propose a forward-looking econometric methodology to determine conversion rates by calculating the degree of misalignment in the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and apply it to}} the GCC currency union. For each GCC currency, we identify the year at which the economy is the closest to its internal and external equilibrium, and then estimate the degree of misalignment in the bilateral real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> vis-Ã -vis the U. S. dollar based on WEO forecasts until 2013. Application of the methodology to other regions is also considered.

A brief survey of the literature and country experience is followed by {{an analysis of the}} objectives, timing, amount, degree of transparency, and choice of markets and counterparties in conducting intervention. The analysis highlights the difficulty of detecting <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignments and disorderly markets, and argues in favor of parsimony in official intervention. Determining the timing and amount of intervention is a highly subjective excercise, and some degree of discretion is almost necessary, though policy rules may serve as "rules of thumb.

Cross-country analysis of variations in international reserves and nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> shows that (i) truly fixed pegs and independent floats differ significantly from other regimes and (ii) significant discrepancies exist between de jure and de facto flexibility. Regression results highlight the influence of political factors (political instability and government temptation to inflate), adequacy of reserves, dollarization (currency substitution), <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk exposure, and some traditional optimal currency area criteria, in particular capital mobility, on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime selection. <b>Exchange</b> rates;Developing countries;Dollarization;Exchange <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, trade openness, political economy, currency unions, currency substitution, currency boards, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> external shocks, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, foreign <b>exchange,</b> currency areas, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, currency pegs, trading partner, foreign <b>exchange</b> market, unemployment <b>rate,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> arrangements, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, trade partner, optimum currency areas, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> world economy, export share, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> trade growth, movements in <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, domestic shocks, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> transition economies, currency convertibility, exchange market intervention, optimal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> world market, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustments, terms of trade, monetary unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, open economy...|$|R
